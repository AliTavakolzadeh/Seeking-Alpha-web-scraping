11111,Presentation,"Greetings and welcome to Christopher & Banks Corporation Fiscal Third Quarter 2020 Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn this conference over to your host, Ms. Jean Fontana from ICR. Thank you. You may begin.",Operator,4394051
,,,,
11112,Presentation,"Thank you, Laura. Good morning and thank you for joining us for the Christopher & Banks third quarter fiscal 2020 earnings conference call. Presenting on today?s call will be Keri Jones, President and Chief Executive Officer and Richard Bundy, Chief Financial Officer. This morning?s conference call is in conjunction with the earnings release that the company issued this morning.",Jean Fontana,4394051

,,,,
11114,Presentation,"And with that, I will turn the call over to Keri Jones.",Jean Fontana,4394051
,,,,
11115,Presentation,"Thank you, Jean. Good morning and thank you for joining the Christopher & Banks third quarter earnings call. While we made every effort to navigate our business through the challenges presented by COVID-19, we did not see the recovery we have anticipated in the third quarter. Sales decreased 23% compared to the third quarter last year, following a 30% year-over-year decline in the second quarter. We believe that COVID has had an outsized impact on our customer demographics as our shopping behavior is more pragmatic, with limited demand for new outfits in the absence of social engagements.",Keri Jones,4394051
,,,,
11116,Presentation,"In the fourth quarter to-date, sales trends have remained consistent with the third quarter decline. Given the reality that the pandemic is likely to pressure sales, over the next several months, we made the decision to engage external advisors as we work to refinance our debt and explore other strategic alternatives. At the outset of the pandemic, we reacted quickly with dramatic cash preservation tactics such as furloughs, salary and wage reductions, and payment deferrals and reductions with our vendors and our landlords. We implemented health and safety measures in our distribution centers as well as in our stores as they reopened and we obtained a $10 million PPP loan, which improved our cash position and enabled us to get back up to more normalized staffing levels and begin executing our fall and holiday plans.",Keri Jones,4394051
,,,,
11117,Presentation,"Throughout this period, we also worked aggressively to leverage the investments we made to expand and enhance our omni-channel shopping experience. We also focused on maintaining engagement with our customers and found new ways to communicate with her such as our behind the brand e-mail series and individual store Facebook pages. We believe that we took the right actions to protect our business. And I want to thank our incredible team for their agility, hard work and commitment to our brand and to our customers.",Keri Jones,4394051
,,,,
11118,Presentation,,Keri Jones,4394051
,,,,
11119,Presentation,"During the third quarter, we control the controllables and remained intently focused on executing our fall and holiday strategies. We made a decision early on to drive aggressive promotions throughout the entire quarter to give our customer confidence that no matter where and when she chooses to shop, she knows that she will be getting a great value. We have reinvented our in-store style events through virtual style shows and we offered her personalized appointments. However, we believe that our customers are not shopping in store largely due to the resurgence of COVID and these events did not generate nearly the participation rates that store events have in the past.",Keri Jones,4394051
,,,,
11120,Presentation,"Illustrating the impact of these annual events as well as big shopping days such as Black Friday, we saw marked decline in sales during these high volume days. The Christopher & Banks customer is a practical, middle-aged Midwestern woman who largely buys apparel for specific events, whether it be going to the movies, out to dinner, holiday parties or other social gatherings. In the absence of these types of social engagements during COVID, her demand for outfitting is simply lower.",Keri Jones,4394051
,,,,
11121,Presentation,"While we are seeing lower demand for apparel, we do believe that our assortments are hitting the mark. Our assortments feature the holiday thematics that she loves along with lots of soft cozy fabrics in our sweaters and in our relaxed restyle collection. We have been particularly pleased with the response to our recently expanded sleepwear category as well as with our face mask sales. We continue to connect with our customers through e-mail, direct mail and social media. An added layer of this holiday is our [indiscernible] campaign. This campaign shows her a creative way to pay it forward with gifts from Christopher & Banks.",Keri Jones,4394051
,,,,
11122,Presentation,"Importantly, we continue to leverage our omni-channel capabilities, such as buy online pick-up in store. We saw an accelerated use of buy online, pick-up in store with close to 40% of our customers adding to their order when they pick-up in store. One of the attributes that drove me to Christopher & Banks was the incredible customer loyalty for this brand. Prior to the pandemic, we had reached great milestones on our path to recovery as a result of the execution of our strategic initiatives. We were outpacing industry sales trends, delivering better margins and driving significant improvement in profitability. Our formula was working.",Keri Jones,4394051
,,,,
11123,Presentation,"For this reason, we believe that once we enter the post-pandemic world, she will return to her trusted resource for fashion, quality, value and service. If given adequate financial runway, we continue to believe that this brand has potential based on our strong following and the sizable and underserved market we continue to serve. One of my top priorities since I joined the company was to drive new customers to our brand. We knew that she was out there and we could capture her with an enhanced product assortment, more impactful marketing strategies, elevated customer service and delivery of a full omni-channel shopping experience. My belief in our long-term potential is in large part due to the number of new customers we drew to the brand as well as the deeper engagement we experienced with existing customers prior to the pandemic. Therefore, we are aggressively pursuing options that would allow us to continue this turnaround.",Keri Jones,4394051
,,,,
11124,Presentation,"Now, I will turn the call over to Richard to discuss the third quarter performance in more detail. Richard?",Keri Jones,4394051
,,,,
11125,Presentation,"Thank you, Keri. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Throughout the third quarter, we maintained disciplined cost controls and optimized our liquidity while prioritizing the health and safety of our associates and customers. As Keri mentioned, while we saw sequential improvement in third quarter sales trends, the challenges presented by COVID-19 continued to have a meaningful adverse impact on our performance.",Richard Bundy,4394051
,,,,
11126,Presentation,,Richard Bundy,4394051
,,,,
11127,Presentation,"Net sales decreased 22.6% to $72.8 million compared to $94.1 million in last year?s third quarter. Comparable sales declined 22.5%. Partially offsetting the decline in retail sales, e-commerce sales grew 32.4% for the quarter. The net sales decrease was comprised of a 17% decrease in average unit retail, a 5.8% decrease in the number of transactions and a 1% decline in the units per transaction. Average unit retail was down as a result of deeper promotions to move the seasonal product and to drive sales and traffic both online and in stores. The increased promotions drove significant improvements in conversion rates across all channels and helped us work through excess seasonal inventory. Excluding split shipments, units per transaction were up 10.6%, which is more reflective of the actual demand for product.",Richard Bundy,4394051
,,,,
11128,Presentation,"Gross margin rate decreased 930 basis points to 24.6% from 33.9% in the same period last year. This decrease reflected lower merchandise margin due to markdowns, higher shipping costs from increased e-commerce orders and split shipments related to ship-from-store orders and de-leverage on lower revenue. We experienced longer than expected supply chain delays leaving us in a less than optimal inventory position. Specifically, our average inventory levels in Q3 were 21% lower than Q3 of last year. As a result, our assortment skewed toward older product versus fresh receipts. This mix of product put pressure on our top line sales as well as merchandise margins.",Richard Bundy,4394051
,,,,
11129,Presentation,"Lastly, occupancy cost de-leveraged approximately 30 basis points despite the $2.8 million reduction related primarily to savings from previous lease negotiations. We book occupancy at full contract rents and so we have a fully signed amendment and therefore our gross profit does not fully reflect rent concessions or deferrals related to COVID. Today, we have negotiated rent abatements and deferrals at over 75% of our stores, with fiscal 2020 savings of over $7 million to-date.",Richard Bundy,4394051
,,,,
11130,Presentation,"SG&A expense declined $3 million or 10% from last year?s third quarter primarily due to lower store and corporate compensation, marketing, professional services and store operations costs partially offset by an increase in medical insurance claims and online marketing cost. As a percentage of sales, SG&A expense de-levered 500 basis points to 36.1%. Depreciation and amortization expense was flat to last year at $2 million. Net loss in the third quarter was $10.8 million or $0.29 per share compared to a net income for the prior period of $0.5 million or $0.01 per share. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure decreased to negative $8.2 million compared to $2.8 million for the same period last year.",Richard Bundy,4394051
,,,,
11131,Presentation,"Now, turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.2 million. As of October 31, 2020, bank borrowings under our credit facility totaled $10.1 million, with $6.8 million of availability. We had $5 million of principal outstanding under our term loan facility. As we discussed last quarter, we qualified for a $10 million PPP loan. We applied those loan proceeds towards the payment of qualified payroll expenses in accordance with the conditions of the loan agreement and our loan forgiveness application was submitted to the Small Business Administration on October 27. The SBA has 90 days to review and issue a decision regarding forgiveness. We believe that the SBA will approve the PPP loan forgiveness application and the loan principal will be entirely forgiven under the CARES Act.",Richard Bundy,4394051
,,,,
11132,Presentation,"Total inventory was $47.3 million at the end of the third quarter of 2020 slightly above the $46.4 million at the end of the same period last year. Our in-transit inventory increased $8.8 million to last year due to a large portion of fall receipts shifting at approximately 3 to 4 weeks due to COVID-related impacts in our supply chain. We continue to work aggressively to adapt to the current environment, protecting cash through cost savings and financing activities. We are not providing guidance for the fourth quarter due to the low visibility related to COVID and other macro factors. We have taken several steps to optimize liquidity. However, significant uncertainty surrounding the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business remains. As a result, revenues, results of operations and cash flows continue to be materially adversely impacted, which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a growing concern within 1 year after the date of our audited financial statements.",Richard Bundy,4394051
,,,,
11133,Presentation,,Richard Bundy,4394051
,,,,
11134,Presentation,"Due to these uncertainties and the expectation of continued sales pressure throughout the coming months, as Keri mentioned, we have engaged strategic advisors, including B. Riley Securities to assist with the evaluation of strategic alternatives. These may include, but are not limited into lease concessions and deferrals, further reductions of operating and capital expenditures, raising additional capital, including seeking a refinancing of the company?s debt, sale of the company or its assets and restructuring its debt and liabilities through private restructuring or a restructuring under the protection of applicable bankruptcy laws. We will provide updates on these measures and intend to disclose further developments once the Board of Directors has approved a specific transaction or otherwise determines that, that disclosure is appropriate.",Richard Bundy,4394051
,,,,
11135,Presentation,"Now, we will turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session.",Richard Bundy,4394051
,,,,
11136,Question-and-Answer,[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Eric Beder with SCC Research. You may proceed with your question.,Operator,4394051
,,,,
11137,Question-and-Answer,"Okay, good morning.",Eric Beder,4394051
,,,,
11138,Question-and-Answer,Good morning.,Keri Jones,4394051
,,,,
11139,Question-and-Answer,"Could you talk about when you see the inventory flows at least normalize in terms of newer product and getting it to the level that where you want it to be? And obviously online seems to be working, how is that working in terms of are you seeing a decreased demand from buy online, pick-up in store and how is that working?",Eric Beder,4394051
,,,,
11140,Question-and-Answer,"So, I will take your first question, Eric on the inventory front. So as Richard mentioned, inventory levels were lighter than what we would have liked through third quarter. And we mentioned that we are running 3 to 4 weeks late on our last call and that was not just at the beginning of the quarter, it ended up being throughout the whole quarter. We are caught up now as of the end of November into closer to planned inventory levels. And your question online, I am not sure I got that exactly. Can you repeat that?",Keri Jones,4394051
,,,,
11141,Question-and-Answer,"You have been much more aggressive in talking to your customer about buying online, and pick-up in store, how has that been working?",Eric Beder,4394051
,,,,
11142,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. So we are really pleased with that. The percent of customers that are selecting to go in store to pickup their purchases have been increasing as well as I referenced in the remarks that close to 40% of the time she is adding on to her purchase. So, this is a strategy that we have been really excited about. And I think that we will continue to see that grow and we expect that throughout the holiday season. And as you know, shipping times are being extended across the industry. So, we expect this to grow throughout the balance of the Christmas season.",Keri Jones,4394051
,,,,
11143,Question-and-Answer,"And last question, so the results here ? were there any kind of regional variations that you were seeing or was this pretty much throughout the entire chain?",Eric Beder,4394051
,,,,
11144,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, Eric. When you look at it over the course of the quarter, it was pretty widespread. There was times where it was impacting certain areas more, a lot of that you could see and kind of almost mapped back to where the COVID increases and resurgence were happening. So, it varied throughout the quarter, but overall it was pretty similar impact across the board.",Richard Bundy,4394051
,,,,
11145,Question-and-Answer,"Okay, good luck for the holiday season.",Eric Beder,4394051
,,,,
11146,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you, Eric.",Keri Jones,4394051
,,,,
11147,Question-and-Answer,"Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of today?s question-and-answer session. I would like to turn this call back over to Ms. Keri Jones for closing remarks.",Operator,4394051
,,,,
11148,Question-and-Answer,Thank you for joining us today and we look forward to updating you on our next call. Happy holidays everyone.,Keri Jones,4394051
,,,,
11149,Question-and-Answer,This concludes today?s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and enjoy the rest of your day.,Operator,4394051
,,,,
11150,Question-and-Answer,,Operator,4394051
,,,,
11151,Presentation,"Hello and welcome to the TUI FY'20 Results Conference Call. My name is Molly and I'll be your coordinator for today's event. Please note that this call is being recorded and for the duration of the call, your lines will be on listen-only. However, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator instructions].",Operator,4394041
,,,,
11152,Presentation,I'd now like to hand you over to your host Friedrich Joussen to begin today's conference. Thank you.,Operator,4394041
,,,,
11153,Presentation,"Thank you very much and good morning, everybody to our virtual conference. It's not only virtual for you; it's also virtual for us. I don?t sit with the team, but I hope it will be rocking well. Let me turn to page number three to show you a little bit what will be doing. I will be doing opening statement and Sebastian and Birgit will talk about in section two or three about results and again the support package and the later stage was there and our thinking. I will be talking about market trends and the next your perspective and then actually we have the honor to introduce our new CFO.",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11154,Presentation,"As you as you Birgit will be leaving we are very sad about that. But the new CFO is an old companion, not only to me, but also to the company. Very experienced in the industry and Sebastian will actually introduce himself at the end of the meeting. ",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11155,Presentation,"So, now turning to page number 4. You can say that COVID-19 has been the greatest crisis in the tourism sector and also for us. And you'll see that reflected in financial year 2020 results. The good thing is, I think when you look at vaccination news coming, testing news coming. When you look at the booking patterns, when you look at all these, I think we have seen the worst. And you know also with our new financing package, I think we would be able to look for the crisis. So that's something which -- it?s not a pretty picture for financially year 2020 but fortunately is past. ",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11156,Presentation,"We actually -- in the year 2020, we of course saw an incredibly strong start. Of course also of better consolidated market with Thomas Cook not being there anymore. January/February was fabulous. We added capacities after that and then a standstill. So, that was something we needed to tackle and we took -- we took out cost.",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11157,Presentation,"But now, I think after start and stop of bookings in the summer and also in the winter, we are now looking at 82% down in capacities. I believe that it still a business that's good and you will see that, I believe particularly when you look at summer, it will be different. I mean the one before last bullet says, 50% of capacity sold in May which is the first summer month, and of course, subsequent months we?re going to achieve better. ",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11158,Presentation,"And we will also talk a little bit about the relative price which is up 14%. So, it?s good selling levels. It's even better than good prices. And therefore, if we don't close down next summer again and I can at least know with the vaccine and the new testing regimes following and the COVID was which we are working against. I think we have seen the worst. ",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11159,Presentation,"Now, bullet point number 4 on the slide talks about the realignment program. We took -- not only took out 70% of cost immediately, and you know that after the lockdown in March. But also we put up a realignment program which does two things.",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11160,Presentation,"First of all, it reduces dramatically cost. And secondly, it pushes digitalization, so that cost savings don?t go in line with quality deterioration, yeah. The process is right now one process every available system everywhere and fully digital. And we are now confident enough to increase our target from ?300 million annual savings to ?400 million annual savings. ",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11161,Presentation,,Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11162,Presentation,"So, we tightened the program. We are executing well. We are running in front of our objectives. And therefore, we are now confident to commit to ?400 million annual savings which is of course good if you look through the crisis in a much different cost structure.",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11163,Presentation,"Additional support package we talked about, and that's very important for three things. First of all, it provides of the ?1.8 billion, ?1.5 billion are additional liquidity, ?300 million were out for actually the repayment of the bond. ",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11164,Presentation,"The second thing is, it is largely equity or equity related or equity resource instrument and also guarantees. That means no debt or very limited debt. And that is important for the balance sheet long term. ",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11165,Presentation,"And lastly, this said package we move out first maturities of our debt instruments from actually second quarter or quarter starting April next year to quarter starting July in 2022. And that gives us more than 18 months. And when you think about the whole crisis in nine months, it's a lot of time that we can actually take care of the ways how we will pay and construct our debt embellishing positions. ",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11166,Presentation,"And then lastly, on that slide, significant positive market. We actually, on the announcement. I mean just the share price just you know that we were right now in the position to structure our new financing round also including ?500 million of equity raise. You know, it was something as a consequence of just the vaccine announcement. And obviously, this is something which customers but also you, as investors, see as a as a turning point. And combined this antigen testing, I think it is what we also believe a turning point for our company. ",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11167,Presentation,"So, I believe we are strongly positioned to benefit from market recovery which no doubt will come. Demand is there. Of course, now restrictions are more regulatory and legal and not demand-driven. And therefore, you know we can resume the growth trajectory as soon as markets open up again. ",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11168,Presentation,"Now, I have now talked about slide number five and six in my summary. And maybe let me, before I hand over to Birgit, turn to page number eight. And here, you see the full-year numbers and Q4 numbers. Revenue is maybe not so interesting. The only thing you see it is ?8 billion. So, it is minus 58%. So, it has been a very restricted year. Okay. It's not a surprise. ",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11169,Presentation,"But maybe focusing on to the full year, EBIT, it is minus ?3 billion. That is, of course, when you take into account -- let's take into account the impairments, the bottom, large impairment driven one-off effect. The impairment is because of the higher WACC just an accounting thing. But ?2.2 billion, ?2.4 billion of these ?3 billion are the potentially additional debt, which is there. It's not all additional debt but largely. And Birgit will talk about it because just to get it right what is there to say. ",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11170,Presentation,"If you look at liquidity and the cash burn we had, largely, it's also driven by the payout of customer, the prepayments, which of course will immediately flow as working capital into the system again as soon as the business starts again. But Birgit will highlight that a little bit more in detail. It's not a pretty number but fortunately it is the view into the past and not a view into the future. And either be coming back with a view into the future and hand over to Birgit right now starting with page number 9.",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11171,Presentation,"Thank you, Fried and good morning to you all. So, I will be taking you to the financial starting with the usual EBIT which we schedule on each day. Sorry there is an echo. Okay. So on the left, we start with our fiscal year 2019 underlying EBIT of ?893 million and we then add up the positive contribution from our strong first five-month performance and this brings us to ?990 million. And for a profound view we are adding back a ?114 million of non-repeat feet of the Boeing Max grounding costs as compared to the previous period.",Birgit Conix,4394041
,,,,
11172,Presentation,,Birgit Conix,4394041
,,,,
11173,Presentation,"And as you can see from the next bar, the overall COVID-19 impact for this fiscal year amounted to ?3.4 billion in total of which ?2.2 billion relates to the fourth quarter. And the next block represents the full year impact of our impairments change versus prior year. And this is the increase of ?505 million and of which the majority occurred in the nine-month period I've discussed with you during our last quarter results. And the full year amount consists of the following buckets. It's a roughly ?200 million for hotels and resorts, ?150 million for the Marella cruise ships and ?150 million for other impairments and these are mainly cost save related.",Birgit Conix,4394041
,,,,
11174,Presentation,"And as a reminder, the impairments were triggered due to a higher WACC from an increased market risk premium which is often higher discount on our planned future cash flows. And then the loss last year, as you can see, we equally record an impact of nearly ?250 million of hedging ineffectiveness and this is due to a reassessment of capacity requirements related to COVID-19. And as a result, our overall underlying EBIT recorded a ?3 billion loss for the fiscal year. ",Birgit Conix,4394041
,,,,
11175,Presentation,"So, moving over to slide 9. You will find our income statement with the explanations on a like-for-like basis under IAS 17. And I will give you [indiscernible] with my comments as well as figures that are impacted by COVID-19 and a more detailed analysis is meaningless. So, I'd like to highlight once again our achievements on fixed cost reductions. So, in the fourth quarter, we delivered a fixed cost run rate of ?260 million, which is fully in line with our internal expectations.",Birgit Conix,4394041
,,,,
11176,Presentation,"And this really demonstrates that during the COVID-19 pandemic, we managed to substantially reduce our cost base. And it also demonstrates our ability to rapidly react and decrease our operational gearing in an absolute crisis situation. And as mentioned in my previous slides and that?s what you can see here, the total impairments in underlying EBIT amounts to ?550 million. And of which ?209 million lies in underlying EBITDA and ?306 million in D&A. ",Birgit Conix,4394041
,,,,
11177,Presentation,"And then allow me one comment on the adjustments, which resulted in a net positive of ?70 million. And this consist of restructuring costs and PPA with a total of nearly ?400 million and an impairment on goodwill and property of roughly ?100 million. And the adjustments are more than offset by the successful disposals of Hapag-Lloyd Cruises [ph] business. Another P&L provision I would like to comment on is the increase in net interest predominantly reflecting the utilization of the RCF and the first KfW facility.",Birgit Conix,4394041
,,,,
11178,Presentation,"Then, moving to slide 10. And this is the 12-month period cash flow. And in this unprecedented situation and as we discussed also during all the previous calls, managing our cash flow and liquidity really remains the number one key priority for us. And we actively addressed the cash items in our control. So, let's go then to the main drivers of the fiscal year 2020 cash flow. And then here, as you know, the group?s underlying EBITDA loss is driven by the COVID-19 standstill, the related impairments and also the impact on hedging ineffectiveness which I discussed on the bridge as well. ",Birgit Conix,4394041
,,,,
11179,Presentation,"And then the working capital outflow, such a major component here is mainly driven by refund obligations due to the continuous restrictions on travel and also the settlement of trade payables. And a few elements I would like to point out, the ?800 million decrease in customer deposits compared to prior year and we will be able to re-utilize ?300 million of pre-prepayments made before the pandemic. So as a result, we expect the working capital position to recover as soon as operations restarts and people start booking again. ",Birgit Conix,4394041
,,,,
11180,Presentation,"So we managed to reduce net investments but it's also important to note here and in a significant way reflecting our decision to pause all projects in Q3 and Q4. So compared to our previous operating guidance range, we nearly halved our spend. ",Birgit Conix,4394041
,,,,
11181,Presentation,,Birgit Conix,4394041
,,,,
11182,Presentation,"And additionally, the sale of the German specialist business and the disposal proceeds from the Hapag-Lloyd transaction more than offset our net investments resulting in a positive inflow of ?150 million. And as you know, our dividends were paid before the pandemic. And our financing cash flow reflects the full utilization of our RCF and the first tranche of KfW facility. And Sebastian will later talk about certain P&L and cash flow assumptions for the full-year 2021. ",Birgit Conix,4394041
,,,,
11183,Presentation,"So, then, if we move to slide 11 on the net debt. And then, the table on the left is driven by the negative free cash flow after dividends of roughly ?3.6 billion as the other items you could see net each other out. And then, so I will therefore focus my comments on the net debt and financing table on the right-hand side of the chart.",Birgit Conix,4394041
,,,,
11184,Presentation,"And here, you see the increase in net debt by ?3.6 billion. It?s mainly driven by the components we already discussed like our losses in reported EBITDA, our working capital outflow, and then also further impact of ?0.3 billion consisting of the dividends and other cash flow and net debt items. And the number is -- important to note the number of ?3.6 billion does not to reflect the second and the third support packages, which I will detail in a minute. And then, for the financing of the ?3.6 billion, we utilized our existing RCF, the first KfW support package, and we drew up on our cash position. ",Birgit Conix,4394041
,,,,
11185,Presentation,"So, let me now come to the additional support package which we announced a week ago. But first, let me introduce it a bit on slide 13 with the latest development since our pre-close trading update and what have changed since then.",Birgit Conix,4394041
,,,,
11186,Presentation,"So as of late September, our business was significantly impacted by the increase in COVID-19 infection rates. And as you know this led to a new lockdown-like situation which led to customer uncertainty regarding new bookings and also timing of booking. And so we've therefore further adjusted our planning scenarios and expect the H1 liquidity to be lower and working capital recovery to be later than originally anticipated.",Birgit Conix,4394041
,,,,
11187,Presentation,"And these reasons led to the negotiation of the further support package securing another ?1.8 billion bridging us to expected travel recovery. So and then on slide 14, the -- and here I will not go into that on this slide. But it does show you also from the callers unfortunately a lot of risk but it shows you the complexity of managing the opening and closing of travel destinations across our various markets. And as you can even see from the predominant risk saving for the first quarter of our fiscal year 2021, most markets remain closed for travel.",Birgit Conix,4394041
,,,,
11188,Presentation,"So, then if we move to slide 15 regarding our liquidity outlook and as I already said, our liquidity also for the first half of 2021 is slightly higher than initially expected due to the renewed travel restrictions. And our Q4 monthly cash outflow has developed entirely in line with our expectation.",Birgit Conix,4394041
,,,,
11189,Presentation,"And then the Q1 of our fiscal year 2021 really goes in a higher liquidity outflow due to the restricted travel situation which I already described in which you saw from the previous page. So, we therefore expect a range of ?400 million to ?50 million of monthly cash outflows which equally includes supply agreement.",Birgit Conix,4394041
,,,,
11190,Presentation,"We assume development for Q2 for the fiscal year 2021. It will be driven by two main factors. So the net cost in the range of ?250 million to ?300 million and also a working capital development which will depend on the COVID-19 situation at the time. So, that is difficult to predict right now.",Birgit Conix,4394041
,,,,
11191,Presentation,"Then on slide 16 and you notice this, a bit of this page was presented to you last week during our management call and it was presented by Fried and Peter and it shows a view components for a total amount of ?1.8 billion. And the package is based on support of the government and also shareholders with the significant support of our major shareholder uniform representing the Mordashov family. And it's also supported by a syndicate of banks on the debt and on the capital increase side.",Birgit Conix,4394041
,,,,
11192,Presentation,,Birgit Conix,4394041
,,,,
11193,Presentation,"So, let me then quickly go over the deal again with the four view components. The first component relates to the economic stabilization funds from the German state which is called WSF. And it consists of two hybrid facilities which are financed participation of a total of ?700 million. And in the appendix of the presentation you will find more details on the deal structure.",Birgit Conix,4394041
,,,,
11194,Presentation,"And the first facility is a ?420 million hybrid with a conversion option into two issues but only up to a maximum of 25% plus 1 share at a conversion price of ?1. So, this is a straight convertible. And the second facility is a net ?280 million hybrid, and this is a hybrid subordinated instrument, which also receives IFRS equity credit. ",Birgit Conix,4394041
,,,,
11195,Presentation,"And as you can see from the chart, this is a leasing framework agreement for the entire year. And then, the second component on the right-hand side relates to a ?200 million additional revolving credit facility supported by the KfW. And the main difference with the existing KfW credit line is that this will be a secured line as opposed to the other lines which are unsecured.",Birgit Conix,4394041
,,,,
11196,Presentation,"And other than that, the terms are in alignment with the previously agreed lines. And at the same time, we are able to prolong the maturity of the ?500 million cash, which was due at the 1st of April 2021, and we were able to extend that to July 26 -- 2022. ",Birgit Conix,4394041
,,,,
11197,Presentation,"And then, the third component is a ?400 million state guarantee which will unlock existing cash collaterals which we accumulated to start period. And this is, as we already explained, on the back of our credit rating and current situation. And these collaterals are related to European regulatory authorities and also credit card providers. And this is really good news because this can now be freed up instead of being restricted to cash, and it therefore strengthens our liquidity position with an equivalent amount.",Birgit Conix,4394041
,,,,
11198,Presentation,"And in addition, I mentioned just on alternative view, there is a [indiscernible] in the WSF term sheet that the Hybrid II will be increased by an equivalent ?400 million as a potential bridge and fallback in case the state guarantees are not realized.",Birgit Conix,4394041
,,,,
11199,Presentation,"And then, the fourth component is a ?500 million capital increase available to all of our existing shareholders. And we plan to reduce our nominal value of shares from ?2.56 to ?1 and we plan to issue 500 million new shares at ?1 net. It?s price will be ?1.07 to include the transaction costs with a net proceeds of ?1 per share. ",Birgit Conix,4394041
,,,,
11200,Presentation,"And all shareholders are invited to participate as this is a capital raise with subscription rights. And the ?500 million is fully underwritten by Unifirm and also a syndicate of four banks, of which two banks are our brokers. And ?300 million of the ?500 million proceeds will be used to repay our senior bonds outstanding with a maturity in October 2021. And as a result, our first maturity will be in July 2022. ",Birgit Conix,4394041
,,,,
11201,Presentation,"So then, if we then move to slide 17. This relates to the equity-related components. You can see that an EGM resolution is planned for January to reduce the nominal value per share from ?2.56 to ?1, as well as an increase of conditional capital to enable the conversion rate of a Hybrid I. And then an authorization of the equity capital raise and also a rights issue. Sorry. And the resolution on the ?420 million hybrid bond share which I mentioned. And then just to note that the rights issue will be executed under German law and UK listing rules. ",Birgit Conix,4394041
,,,,
11202,Presentation,"And then, on slide 18, you can see an overview of the timeline. And then from today on, the next step is to send out an invitation for an extraordinary general meeting to as I -- and I already mentioned to have a resolution by the shareholders on the capital reduction from the ?2.56 to ?1 nominal value. To get a resolution for the ?500 million capital increase and to have a resolution on the ?420 million Hybrid 1. ",Birgit Conix,4394041
,,,,
11203,Presentation,,Birgit Conix,4394041
,,,,
11204,Presentation,"And then in January, we will hold a virtual extraordinary general meeting. And soon thereafter, we are planning to launch the rights issue which according to German standards, foresees a two-week subscription offer period. And during the subscription offer period, the investors can decide to participate in the capital increase and then a settlement will follow shortly after the last day of the subscription offer period. ",Birgit Conix,4394041
,,,,
11205,Presentation,"And then if we move to slide 19, which is from my section, the last slide. So, the support package really underpins the strong trust alignment and also a commitment from the German state and our main shield, Unifirm representing the Mordashov family. It easily it increases our equity base by ?800 million on an average of 16 days and it allows us to repay the ?300 million bonds and through this extends our maturity profile until July 2022.",Birgit Conix,4394041
,,,,
11206,Presentation,"And important to note is that the 30th of November, our pro forma liquidity including the support package amounts to ?2.5 billion. And on the right-hand side, reconciliation from our cash an available facility since the beginning of the pandemic until the 30th of November. ",Birgit Conix,4394041
,,,,
11207,Presentation,"And let me once again highlight that we saw a liquidity outflow of ?3.4 billion, of which ?1.7 billion [ph] to working capital, ?450 million or ?400 million to ?450 million on of cash collateral. And we expect the working capital to recover with the normalization of travel and the cash collaterals will be freed up by the state guarantees of ?400 million.",Birgit Conix,4394041
,,,,
11208,Presentation,"Now, before I hand over to Fritz, I would like to thank you for interactions over the past 2.5 years not only during this COVID crisis but equally doing the Boeing Max crisis. And despite the difficult external challenges we faced, I felt you have been understanding for the situation, and I equally felt we had a very constructive one-to-one meetings together.",Birgit Conix,4394041
,,,,
11209,Presentation,"So, I?m happy that TUI secured its financing for the next phase to come. And I also trust that in terms of immediate liquidity crisis we have now seen the worst. And so, from here, TUI should be able to build up again and come out winning, which Fritz and Sebastian will talk about later and now as of the next slide. ",Birgit Conix,4394041
,,,,
11210,Presentation,"So, thanks again. And with that, let me hand over to Fritz.",Birgit Conix,4394041
,,,,
11211,Presentation,"Birgit, thank you very much. You are -- this was a departing message here, but you are not departing yet because you will be in the Q&A and the remainder. So, please stay around. And as I would like to talk a little bit about the future because I think last year has been -- last year and now, let's look forward.",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11212,Presentation,"And the first question, of course, which everybody puts top on the agenda, do we have a market or do we have regulatory issue? And here I have a couple of information and slides which actually show very clearly that not only we think that it was largely a regulatory issue. So, people actually were not allowed to travel but they wanted to travel. ",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11213,Presentation,"And the first one is the first picture I have here is actually the Euromonitor Market Research, which actually says that the market will be back very fast. In 2022, we will see levels of 2019 and even in 2021 which is started here is ?1.3 billion. And that I think is very promising because not only the markets will be back, but through the crisis and even before the crisis, we saw consolidation happening. So, that was the reason for the very strong start in 2020. And even after the crisis even more consolidation will have happened. And therefore, we will see a strong demand, a pent-up demand, and we will see a more consolidated market. ",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11214,Presentation,"Then, you look at the whole thing from a customer perspective. I think it's worth looking at the Boston Consulting Consumer Sentiment survey which lately came out. And what is this graph on the left is all about is different customer groups on top from left to right. You'll see the split by age. So, generation Z and Millennials, Generation X and me, the Baby Boomers. So, my generation. And you see household income per capita. So, highest and lowest quartile. So it spans all the incomes.",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11215,Presentation,,Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11216,Presentation,"And you see different rankings of demand which missed the categories. And interesting, everything is different but leisure travel, leisure travel is the one, priority one amongst all age groups and amongst all incomes. And is most of travel, we usually say the most of travel, the core of travel is done every second year. We see that and we believe and also our booking indicates already that you know people couldn't go this year. And therefore there has been an enormous pent-up demand next year. And that is I think very important. ",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11217,Presentation,"Safety also will remain important which is I think also good for us. Because we are taking care of our business model for our customer save -- for our customer safety. We, for example people that travel right now with full screening testing. So that's I think that's very good. And so safety is coming up as an important issue alongside this price and other components. ",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11218,Presentation,"Now, a little bit of anecdotes. I mean it is the customer experience firsthand. And I?ll just give you a broader couple of examples. In November, when we opened Palma on the 15th from Germany we were sold out in 36 hours. I mean this is very unusual. I mean it seemed to be that people were operating in front of the PC and how they could do -- actually it was all online, right? So, I mean the online is already back on previous year's levels.",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11219,Presentation,"The thing which is missing is actually the retail. That's also by the way one of the reasons for this strong restructuring we?re looking at. So, then when you look at Canaries in October. So, just five months five months later, 50% of capacity was sold in one week. In the UK, that's another example. 20,000 bookings in 10 days after the Canary Islands reopened before October half term. So, I mean you see its enormous demand once you open that.",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11220,Presentation,"But even long haul, I mean first plan to Saint Lucia load factor 98%. You say usually people with masks and so on, you know, that is something maybe people would not like not to travel but they do. But what also is interesting, all three flights, you know, and you know this well, the one we -- second and third flight to Saint Lucia load factors increase over 10% week-on-week after the last week.",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11221,Presentation,"I mean this is usually not happening. So, you see late booking trends happening but also perform our Robinson brand, Esquinzo, and Jandia which are both on the Canaries improved 400% -- 430% and 300% respectively year-over-year, the first two weeks of November 2020. So, I mean, we opened more or less in the Canaries again. And you see this kind of bookings as soon as you are opening the demand there. ",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11222,Presentation,"Now, when I look into the booking development as you see on the next slide left winter 2020 in the graphs and then with the dotted line summer 2021, you see in the bottom the 20% capacity for winter. So, it's a very small programming and it?s very volatile, yeah? And bookings down 82% is in line with capacity, the last weeks even improved a little bit. Average sales prices are good. I mean, it?s 4% up. So, that's something good. ",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11223,Presentation,"And now, as we have also seen the reopening in the UK, I would say for the corridors we will see improving trends. But for summer, I think what?s important total net bookings are 10% down versus 2020, but 2020 was already very strong because Thomas Cook was gone. But when you look at summer 2019, which was more normalized, we were -- we are still 3% up. ",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11224,Presentation,"And the interesting thing is we are 14% up on price. And that actually says something about the pent-up demand, people are trading up, that people are saying that summer will come, and the demand is there, and travel will be possible. So, the perception of scarcity I think is also potentially a driver. ",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11225,Presentation,"UK is the market which was opened first. It?s 19% even -- where it?s 19% up versus summer 2020. So, where we had bookings in, we are still running significantly ahead of somewhat with a very strong summer 2020 bookings. And maybe one additional data point which I also provide on my summary page. The first big month of summer is actually May and we are 50% sold. ",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11226,Presentation,,Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11227,Presentation,"So the good thing is I mean, summer is running well and maybe on the next slide you?ll see interesting left booking weeks and days -- booking days, you know, in the winter left and in summer, right. And interestingly enough after the vaccine announcement, the winter was okay -- doing okay-ish, yeah. But the summer bookings really pick up right now. And that actually assess something about the perception of customers that summer 2021 will be recovered markets. ",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11228,Presentation,"Now, one important component is of course the debt we accrue and we are very aware that we will -- we?ll have to be more lean and agile and much more profitable than in the past. So that's the reason why we have the realignment program. We call it a realignment program because it's not only about cost reduction, it's also about driving digitalization. ",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11229,Presentation,"So, the obstacle usually is when you reduce cost, you reduce quality. But we are very aware that -- and we are very focused on increasing quality and reducing cost. And that is possible with our digitization program which we started two years ago. But we are driving much faster right now because we have less traffic in our systems. You know, the migration to the new architecture is easier. ",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11230,Presentation,"And on the right side, you see that we are committing now to ?400 million annual savings starting in 2023. And the reason for that is not additional programs. It is what it is. The progress and the focus is in the middle. But we are, first of all, executing faster. Secondly, we are executing more on the higher end of our initial assumptions, which have been above ?300 million anyway. But then we talked about the first time we didn't want to overcommit, so we talked about ?300 million. Now, we can talk about ?400 million because the programs are firming up and we are running ahead of our savings targets. ",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11231,Presentation,"So, then maybe one example I wanted to do around digitalization is just one proof point of our digital strategy. And I took our newest hotel brand, TUI Blue. There actually we have now we increased our active customer base from last year with almost 200%. But even more important, the bookings which we got in the app actually has almost quadrupled. So, it's up 350%. So, the bookings per user has actually increased, right. And that -- and at the same time, you know, the appreciation of the app is extremely high. ",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11232,Presentation,"So, it's the most popular app in the App Store. So, you see here 8.5 CSQ. And so, it's quality app, redemption app, profit app. We are closer to the customer and of course, you know, this is a huge driver that for example operate in that case we can actually reduce stock into amusement and so in destinations the stock which is -- which was usually selling activities in destination.",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11233,Presentation,"Now let me talk, you know, very briefly before I conclude on some industry fundamentals after the crisis. I think it's very clear, markets and airlines, we did see later booking profiles. We have seen later booking profiles and that will stay a little bit. We believe that long haul does recover fast than the vaccine is available and the testing is available. We see that right now, a good long-haul program even in very small destinations so Mexico is not open from Europe, Jamaica, and Dominican Public are not open. But, you know, as we open except for Cuba, immediately there is demand.",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11234,Presentation,"So, the demand will not only be shuffled and general leisure travel will be also shuffled. That's what we believe. Anyway, we did see an oversupply in the airline market in the foreseeable future. That's the reason why we reduce our fleet 20%, leased 20%. But structuring in Germany one platform but we also believe in owned airline or the control of the airline will stay instrumental in our internal model. So, that's, you know, how we see markets in airline less exposure, less commitment but controlled. ",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11235,Presentation,,Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11236,Presentation,"Then, on Hotels, top right, short term, we will see overcapacities. Strong hotel brands will benefit. So, with our club brands, both our real blue and so on hotel brands we are well positioned. People who can produce traffic and who can produce guaranteed demand, they'll be best placed to actually gain in this recovering market. So, brand product, digital capabilities and also sales will be important and we believe are well positioned.",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11237,Presentation,"In Cruises, this is actually we expect to recover strongly when the vaccine is available and testing. And the strong recovery will lead to an enormous shortage in supply. And we had a shortage of supply before the crisis. Now, in the crisis, many cruise companies have actually scrapped old capacities and actually have stopped investments into new capacities. So, therefore, we believe the demand will high and the supply will be short. So, as soon as it recovers, a good and a very profitable markets. ",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11238,Presentation,"TUI Musement, more or less nothing changed. I mean, we believe in the activity market this is our biggest domestic market. It's very, very -- there?s very many players. It's not consolidated. It's not digitalized. And therefore, our platform strategy will not only take advantage of the growth but also will take advantage of the digitization and consolidation of the market long term. And therefore it stays -- this part of the business has been in the last year a major pillar for our future growth and it will stay. ",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11239,Presentation,"And you know when I look on the next slide, then it is more or less the strategic picture of the strategic roadmap of TUI and we believe that the transformed TUI will be -- which is leaner, which is more digital, less capital intensive is in a great position to take advantage of recovering markets and as markets still have the demand but were regulated down and drive profitable growth. ",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11240,Presentation,"And on my concluding slides here, it?s again, you know, let?s say the history and future of the crisis we had a strong start of the year. We had an enormous lockdown. We took the chance to acquire liquidity, to take down cost immediately and look through the crisis to accelerate our transformation into a lean and agile structure. And I think when you look at the booking trends right now, when you look at latest developments with the testing and vaccination, we will return into a profitable growth soon. There?s a stronger position, less capital intensive and more digital company. ",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11241,Presentation,"That's it from my side. And before we take now questions and I would like to hand over to Sebastian, who is long term in the company, has been the responsible for all our assets in Hotel and Cruise and Destination businesses, and now will at 1st of January take the role of CFO of the company. Sebastian, your stage. ",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11242,Presentation,"Thank you, Fritz. First, I would like to thank Birgit for the smooth hand over transition. It has been good working with you. And I'm really looking forward to the new role. As Fritz rightly said, I?ve been almost 30 years in the company and I also had finance roles before. ",Sebastian Ebel,4394041
,,,,
11243,Presentation,"We are all aware of this current situation. Hardly any revenues till March. We were able to secure liquidity very quickly. And we also looked into the different scenarios, a resumption in Spring 2021, but also in a prolonged impositions of international travel bans to secure today?s future. Therefore, we further -- we?re able to secure and support another support package which gives us sufficient liquidity reserves in this volatile market for 2021. And of course, we are looking in a variety of other options to further enhance our liquidity position and to rebuild a solid finance profile. ",Sebastian Ebel,4394041
,,,,
11244,Presentation,"If you go to slide 34, these are my priorities for the next coming month to really drive the recovery and to work towards a healthy balance sheet structure. First, manage the liquidity. We -- the execution of the third support package, a very disciplined CapEx management which is very important, and to work on other divestment sale and manage back possibilities. Second, to drive revenues and earnings. ",Sebastian Ebel,4394041
,,,,
11245,Presentation,,Sebastian Ebel,4394041
,,,,
11246,Presentation,"The most important thing is of course that we are able to be significant profitable. One important thing is as the demand will vary to optimize the capacity, we have done very well in achieving less fixed cost which will help us to cope with demand changes to execute the global realignment program and of course to continue cost discipline and improving the quality through digitalization.",Sebastian Ebel,4394041
,,,,
11247,Presentation,"The good thing is, that this goes hand-in-hand. We can further reduce costs by improving the service to the customer and to drive to its transformation to a return to growth, to a growth path, to take all of the opportunities we do see today for the future of tourism. ",Sebastian Ebel,4394041
,,,,
11248,Presentation,"And last point, to optimize the financing. To focus on asset-right strategy for airlines, for hotels, also for cruise, to manage the debt and the related interest cost and to look and to follow monitor capital markets options which we do see. So, at the end we will have a solid and healthy balance sheet and to return to a growth leverage ratio target of less than 3. Thanks a lot.",Sebastian Ebel,4394041
,,,,
11249,Presentation,"So with that, thank you very much, Sebastian. We now open the -- operator, can you please manage now the Q&A session. Thank you.",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11250,Question-and-Answer,Of course. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Jamie Rollo calling from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.,Operator,4394041
,,,,
11251,Question-and-Answer,"First question just on the leverage number. I know you like to look at growth financial debt which I think thinks in the presentation but it looks to be about ?8.3 billion from the annual report at September. And I suppose that must increase to maybe ?10 billion since then if you draw down on the on the second and third debt instruments. And that's about three times last year?s EBITDA for 2019 EBITDA. So, that's 5 times 2019 EBITDA. So, how do you get that down to the three times target?",Jamie Rollo,4394041
,,,,
11252,Question-and-Answer,"I mean I can see the working capital might take a ?1 billion off that but that still leaves a gap of about ?3 billion. Secondly sticking with debt, the cruise JV debt is up to ?3.3 billion at year end -- up about ?1 billion from that Hapag-Lloyd transaction. I'm just wondering how that is financed and whether there?s any restrictions on the dividends to be received and whether that?s actually capability for the JV to buy Marella now it's got leverage at that level?",Jamie Rollo,4394041
,,,,
11253,Question-and-Answer,"And then finally just on disposals, i.e., the ?400 million to ?500 million but what is the form -- are they straight sales or are they same leasebacks? And if they?re same leasebacks, is that an additional ?400 million to ?500 million of asset financing debt that we should take into account? Thank you.",Jamie Rollo,4394041
,,,,
11254,Question-and-Answer,"Maybe Birgit and Sebastian, can you take number one and two on [indiscernible] to come in.",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11255,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. Okay. So hi, Jamie. So, indeed so if I reconcile the numbers that you quoted there. So, if you look at gross debt at the 30th of September, likely starts with ?7.7 billion. And if you then indeed add back the second and the third facility, you come close to ?10 billion and let?s say ?9.8 million pro forma. And then, you deduct the bond, so the ?300 million, so ?9.5 billion. ",Birgit Conix,4394041
,,,,
11256,Question-and-Answer,"And yes, indeed, we -- as we said earlier, we would definitely target to go down and to go down to a leverage level that is pre-corona, so less than 3 times. And there's four routes for us to restrengthen the balance sheet. And the first is, of course, building a cash back into the business through the tied operational controls and it?s what you've seen there like really enormous focus on costs. And you'll also see even the transformation program helping to deliver that. ",Birgit Conix,4394041
,,,,
11257,Question-and-Answer,"And then, second, the disposals and asset financing, and Sebastian can also talk about that and he will talk about it for you third question. And then, of course, raising capital through debt markets is an option and raising equity. But of all of these options, we are particularly focused on number one and two, which are currently in our control, and that is the cost, the building the cash back and also the disposals and an asset finance. And then, maybe, Sebastian, as you were the architect also on the cruise business, it is your former line of business, I'm going to hand it over to you for that. ",Birgit Conix,4394041
,,,,
11258,Question-and-Answer,,Birgit Conix,4394041
,,,,
11259,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you very much. As you know, TUI Cruises partly by Royal Caribbean, 50% by us, is financing on its own. At the moment, we have two ships with guests cruising from the Canary Islands, which means that five ships are still waiting for being used again. We expect that we will be back to a normal itinerary in early summer. ",Sebastian Ebel,4394041
,,,,
11260,Question-and-Answer,"Also there, we do see strong demand which is very promising at the moment. Also there, the limitation is where we can cruise and where we can't. And at the moment, the Canary Islands are the only sector. We assume that we will be back to normal in 2022 with the yields and occupancies we have seen before. That means that as TUI Cruises had to finance themselves in the recent months, that there will be no dividends for 2021 and 2022. And then we have to see how quickly the improvement will be.",Sebastian Ebel,4394041
,,,,
11261,Question-and-Answer,Second question on the disposals. We have looked at our hotel portfolio. The target is to sell straight and to manage back. There are very attractive options in the market. It's important for us that we get the real value which we do see. It probably will improve further in the next month. It's important for us that we don't fire sale but that we do the right deals and we are working on that and we do see good opportunities there. ,Sebastian Ebel,4394041
,,,,
11262,Question-and-Answer,"When we manage back, it is important for us that we are able to have long-term contracts to make sure that we can keep the significant part of the profits stream. Actually by using the brand concept, especially to TUI Blue, we are also able to add more and more hotels where we have franchised or management contracts to offset the effects of hotels which we have sold.",Sebastian Ebel,4394041
,,,,
11263,Question-and-Answer,"Okay thanks. So just to kind of follow-on on face-to-face. Birgit, did you say that additional equity is still possibly part of the plan? And Sebastian, just on the sell and manage back that we should be taking off obviously some EBITDA in relation to you selling the operations in? ",Jamie Rollo,4394041
,,,,
11264,Question-and-Answer,"So, I can answer the first question. I was just mentioning the optionality. We have a spectrum of options and of course we need to look at everything. But it doesn't mean that I'm now seeing that that will happen. I mean I'm just laying down the options. Thank you, Jamie.",Birgit Conix,4394041
,,,,
11265,Question-and-Answer,"Raising the bar. On the hotel side, yes, of course we sell hotel. We lose profitability. The concept actually that was -- or the strategy which we defined before COVID was that we want to grow significantly our TUI Blue brand.",Sebastian Ebel,4394041
,,,,
11266,Question-and-Answer,"And we do see that due to the crisis, the opportunities are even stronger as hoteliers look for a very strong distribution. And the target very clearly is to offset a part loss of profitability where we have sold our hotel by having more hotels under management or in a franchise concept. And this seems to work very well. If you may recall that we started with tenant TUI Blue hotels 15, 18 months, 2 years ago. We are now around 100. And we do see that we even can accelerate this path.",Sebastian Ebel,4394041
,,,,
11267,Question-and-Answer,"Maybe, Jamie, on my side maybe one thing to add, yeah, how I?d like to see it from the strategic perspective. You have actually two parts of a business when you run a hotel company, yeah. You have a property part, a real estate part, and you have actually an operational part. The real estate part is with us very often part of the integrated P&L. If you separate it, we unleash a lot of value because if you add a terminal value of the business which is the real estate as a terminal value piece. And there is so much money around right now which actually likes to invest into real estate. ",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11268,Question-and-Answer,"And then, of course, you lose a part of the EBIT but not so much because the EBIT on the real estate is not very high. But you keep the control, particularly if you don't sell it but you put it into fund structures and that is what we are talking about. So, we keep full control, we have long-term contracts, and what?s above [indiscernible] you unleash growth because these kind of models if you integrate, if you invested all of yourself, then you would never able to grow the pace we wanted to. ",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11269,Question-and-Answer,,Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11270,Question-and-Answer,"So, it's not this part of the business even we pre-thought before the crisis is not happening to be accelerated. And more or less you could think about our hotel business becoming more a mature hotel business like Hyatt or the others are doing exactly the same, right? So, that?s more or less [indiscernible]. So, we keep control, we keep abreast, we keep whatever. I mean, so we are managing it, but we get it off the balance sheet. And that have some two cases; the first, the growth, and the second...",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11271,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. Got it. Great. Thank you, everyone. And, Birgit, thank you and best of luck.",Jamie Rollo,4394041
,,,,
11272,Question-and-Answer,Thank you.,Birgit Conix,4394041
,,,,
11273,Question-and-Answer,The next question comes from the line of Jaafar Mestari calling from Exane BNP. Please go ahead.,Operator,4394041
,,,,
11274,Question-and-Answer,"Hi. Good morning. Hi. Two questions from me, please. Just firstly on the Summer 2021 program, could you talk a little bit more about the products, destination mix, the length of stay, so what do you need to tweak to the offer or our customers are just literally booking anything that opens. And in these bookings, have you been able so far to maximize the bookings going to your own hotels and the routes that you fly in-house?",Jaafar Mestari,4394041
,,,,
11275,Question-and-Answer,Yes.,Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11276,Question-and-Answer,"And then, secondly, on customer deposits, there?s a useful bridge in notes 33 of the account and you?re saying that working capital outflow going forward is mostly going to be supplier prepayments. So, is it fair to assume the ?1.8 billion of customer deposits in -- on the balance sheet in September mostly relates to actual live bookings, so customers were pretty certain want to travel? Or is there still a significant part of that that is in vouchers, in canceled bookings, etcetera that have a little bit more uncertainty?",Jaafar Mestari,4394041
,,,,
11277,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. Maybe I comment to the program itself. The good thing is the summer program is very broad. And what you see, of course, is a standard right now we had in Summer 2020 enormous bookings into Greece, yeah? So, therefore that is done now and also Spain is very broad and we also expect a little bit of recovery in the long-haul destination but long-haul a much more part in the [indiscernible] right?",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11278,Question-and-Answer,"So, I think it's a pretty safe -- it's a pretty safe bet, you know? So, and today it's more or less whatever is open. And we have the full program of course 80% so, you know, we have less risk. That's what Sebastian also said -- we have said, let?s do a little bit less risk so we are safe yields, yeah?",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11279,Question-and-Answer,"And if the market is too much, let's assume for a moment that we have some overcapacity so if the market is even stronger then we don't lose market shares, right? On the deposits right now, you know, of course, you know, on the working capital, you know, when it comes back, you know, in January or February we?ll have prepayments driven working capital developments. The first time is actually then April, end of March where you have redemption working capital development meaning big, right?",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11280,Question-and-Answer,"So, that is the big first travel season. And therefore, you know, we believe, you know, in the booking -- summer bookings are of utmost importance or of higher importance end of January and February. And then the first redemption actually would take in April. Now, the question is how do we convert in vouchers or is it just dormant?",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11281,Question-and-Answer,"It?s not so much dormant. I would say vouchers are the big part or people asking for repayments. But, you know, after the vaccine we saw a significant step up in our voucher acceptance and also new bookings into summer. And part of the ?1.8 billion are the new bookings as well as free vouchers available. I hope that?",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11282,Question-and-Answer,"And maybe I -- yeah. Maybe I can add on the numbers and the question was on balance sheet and if we?ve [indiscernible] advance payments received and that position is ?1.770 billion. So, ?1.8 billion. And on that, the unredeemed voucher number for a little over ?400 million to give you an idea. ",Birgit Conix,4394041
,,,,
11283,Question-and-Answer,,Birgit Conix,4394041
,,,,
11284,Question-and-Answer,Thank you.,Jaafar Mestari,4394041
,,,,
11285,Question-and-Answer,"And maybe to the question on steering, what we do see, as said before, the Canary Islands are the destination which is open. We bring almost every customer on our own aircraft in almost all in our own hotels. That works extremely well. And we do see the same pattern for summer. The main target is to bring our guests into our own assets to secure the profitability.",Sebastian Ebel,4394041
,,,,
11286,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. That makes sense. Thank you very much.,Jaafar Mestari,4394041
,,,,
11287,Question-and-Answer,The next question comes from the line of James Ainley calling from the Citi. Please go ahead.,Operator,4394041
,,,,
11288,Question-and-Answer,"Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. Three for me as well, please. The first one, can you talk a bit about whether you've seen any changes in the remittance terms from merchant acquirers or the payment terms demanded from your hotel partners?",James Ainley,4394041
,,,,
11289,Question-and-Answer,"The second is, have you seen any bankruptcies from hotel partners? Interested to hear how that might impact your summer program and in particular the costs you might be paying for hotels that you resell? ",James Ainley,4394041
,,,,
11290,Question-and-Answer,"And then third question is, how much industry discussion about cash ring-fencing and trust funds. Are you seeing any emerging developments about -- from regulators to demand cash ring-fencing or use of trust funds for your business? Thank you. ",James Ainley,4394041
,,,,
11291,Question-and-Answer,"Maybe, Birgit and Sebastian can answer.",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11292,Question-and-Answer,Yes. ,Birgit Conix,4394041
,,,,
11293,Question-and-Answer,"Maybe I?ll start with payment providers. Yes, there was some pressure which has now been released. There is a very strong competition between the payment providers so that we do expect that this is now normalizing again. And what also helps is that we are moving in some markets where it's possible to direct debiting like in Central Europe or in Germany where this is very common.",Sebastian Ebel,4394041
,,,,
11294,Question-and-Answer,"And then just maybe on the future developments. I can just talk about the current situation. We have a good relationship actually with the regulating bodies that also of course [indiscernible] collateral damage. I believe that's been really very constructive. And we are happy with the outcome. And then on the credit card collaterals, of course we expect that to change an as you also see the liquidity position that we will have now.",Birgit Conix,4394041
,,,,
11295,Question-and-Answer,"So it's all, I mean relates to [indiscernible] and of course the credit rating that we currently have does not help and then, part of the package that we just negotiated will also help in terms of the ?400 million are guarantees. So I think that's what we can see as we?",Birgit Conix,4394041
,,,,
11296,Question-and-Answer,And it is normalizing so that's what we can clearly say.,Sebastian Ebel,4394041
,,,,
11297,Question-and-Answer,Yeah.,Birgit Conix,4394041
,,,,
11298,Question-and-Answer,There was some part?,Sebastian Ebel,4394041
,,,,
11299,Question-and-Answer,Maybe?,Birgit Conix,4394041
,,,,
11300,Question-and-Answer,That?s normalizing.,Sebastian Ebel,4394041
,,,,
11301,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. Maybe, you know, a word on hotel bankruptcies. We are not seeing huge bankruptcies quite to the contrary. I think, you know, you see right now that, you know, asset values and so on are more and more, you know, I would say increasing potentially in the hotel field, you know, the values are increasing and because people are starting to look for the crisis. And now this is, you know, first of all there is support up in the respective countries for financing but also, you know, the equity which is sitting at the sidelines is not kicking in.",Birgit Conix,4394041
,,,,
11302,Question-and-Answer,"So because people I think I don't know anybody who says that actually leisure travel will not recover. It's a little bit different I would say to business travel, it's quite different to business level but leisure travel, the money is available and that?s I think what you see.",Birgit Conix,4394041
,,,,
11303,Question-and-Answer,And so it?s great even for hotels?,Sebastian Ebel,4394041
,,,,
11304,Question-and-Answer,Low.,Birgit Conix,4394041
,,,,
11305,Question-and-Answer,"Less than 50%. So, I wouldn't expect any major bankruptcies. What we do see is that hoteliers are interesting and very strong sales brand. And this is the opportunity we have. We have with the TUI brand [indiscernible] brand or the Robinson brand.",Sebastian Ebel,4394041
,,,,
11306,Question-and-Answer,,Sebastian Ebel,4394041
,,,,
11307,Question-and-Answer,Yeah.,Birgit Conix,4394041
,,,,
11308,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you. And just following up on that, what's the implication of that for the costs you're paying for hotel capacity for next summer?",James Ainley,4394041
,,,,
11309,Question-and-Answer,"Well, that's not a big problem. I mean quite to the contrary, I mean, we have been renegotiating with almost everybody right now, yeah? I think of course, very clear. I mean, in that situation, we are renegotiating with everybody. ",Sebastian Ebel,4394041
,,,,
11310,Question-and-Answer,"The good thing is the portfolio is actually good and also more and more hotels are, of course, interested in working with us because as Sebastian said there will be a little bit of -- there will be some oversupply. So, we need to invest there. And the interest of working with big marketing and sales brand in order to secure demand is if at all increasing.",Sebastian Ebel,4394041
,,,,
11311,Question-and-Answer,"And just -- I mean, the hotels here are very flexible. They look at their occupancy and know that was part of the transformation. Direct access to the hotel helps them and helps us to fill capacity with the right price we get. So, we are nowadays.",Birgit Conix,4394041
,,,,
11312,Question-and-Answer,The next question comes from Stuart Gordon calling from Berenberg. Please go ahead.,Operator,4394041
,,,,
11313,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. Good morning. Couple of questions. First one, just to confirm the May capacity that you?re talking about, is that similar to the whole summer season sort of 80% of 2019? Secondly, and I maybe missed this in the answer to Jamie, but my understanding is TUI Cruises also have a loan from KfW. Could you confirm how much that is and is that also why dividends will be restricted until at least 2022?",Stuart Gordon,4394041
,,,,
11314,Question-and-Answer,"Thirdly, just on debt maturities. Obviously, it?s 18 months to July 2022, but is it any risk of not getting cleaning sign off for a going concern during 2021 if you don't get that completed sooner rather than later? And just one point of clarification it doesn't look as if you've included the cash collaterals that will be replaced -- that will get the state guarantee. It doesn't look as if you?ve removed them from net debt. Could you just confirm that all the cash, including those cash collateral, are included in the net debt number. Thank you.",Stuart Gordon,4394041
,,,,
11315,Question-and-Answer,"Birgit, do you want to take that or Sebastian?",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11316,Question-and-Answer,"So, start with the answer on TUI Cruises. There is a support from KfW which we don't disclose the number. It?s similar to what I said on the hotel side. Cruise also has a cash breakeven 40%, 45%. So, when the business as it looked like come back, it's really return is very quickly to a positive cash flow. So, that's why we are very positive on cruise. ",Sebastian Ebel,4394041
,,,,
11317,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. I will just -- maybe on the cash collaterals. So, just as a matter there?s partly restricted cash and partly receivables, so it?s a mix. ",Birgit Conix,4394041
,,,,
11318,Question-and-Answer,"And what we are also seeing is that there will be a significant positive impact due to the solid financing of TUI now. I mean, has completely changed the picture in the last 10 days. Okay. Does that answer the questions or what? I think I didn?t hear that.",Sebastian Ebel,4394041
,,,,
11319,Question-and-Answer,Yeah. Just confirmation that your May capacity is similar to the 80% you've talked about to the full summer.,Stuart Gordon,4394041
,,,,
11320,Question-and-Answer,It?s similar to the 2019 levels.,Sebastian Ebel,4394041
,,,,
11321,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. And the last question was on the debt maturities, is there is any risk of -- although it's July 2022, that obviously in the second half of next year is less than 12 months. Is there any risk to growing concern through the year as you publish your gains? ",Stuart Gordon,4394041
,,,,
11322,Question-and-Answer,"No. Because despite, I mean the growing concern if confirmed by the auditors. ",Birgit Conix,4394041
,,,,
11323,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. So because you?re not -- because it?s not formally audited during the year, that's not a risk.",Stuart Gordon,4394041
,,,,
11324,Question-and-Answer,"One, it?s very clear that we are in good talks concerning 2022. For 2021, we are safe and we do even see now upsides. Of course, the situation has improved and we are working on 2022. And there we are very confident that we will come to very good solutions.",Birgit Conix,4394041
,,,,
11325,Question-and-Answer,,Birgit Conix,4394041
,,,,
11326,Question-and-Answer,The next question comes from the line of Richard Clarke calling from Bernstein. Please go ahead. ,Operator,4394041
,,,,
11327,Question-and-Answer,"Three operational questions. if I can. First one is, how can we interpret the 14% price rise that you've talked about for the summer? Maybe we can break that down between what's like-for-like, what's mix, what's people using high value vouchers kind of going forward? And the interpretation of maybe your confidence around can you keep that number positive or near there through to summer?",Richard Clarke,4394041
,,,,
11328,Question-and-Answer,"Second question is on cruise capacity. I assume the 80% number is just about markets and airlines next summer. So, what cruise capacity is going to sit at through next year? And then, it looks like your hotels did quite a lot better in Q4. They were down about 60% versus the markets and airlines down 83%. Is that about you kind of directing customers to your hotels, or is that about sort of geographical mix? And should we think about the hotels continuing to sort of lead on the recovery and what explains that?",Richard Clarke,4394041
,,,,
11329,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. I mean, I think on the hotels exactly what you're saying. I mean, we are directing the traffic into our own hotels. And that is a major driver of the vertical-integrated business model. And that is also the beauty of being it's part. The 14% is an up-trade, is an up-trading. ",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11330,Question-and-Answer,"What we see is that people usually take something and then they are saying, okay, this year I didn't have a proper vacation, or this year I have the vouchers and they are putting this money against the top products. Now, we are positioned very well in the 4 and 5 star segment, and we are seeing the 4 and 5 star segment taking up first. So, therefore, it is I think something which will stick around. ",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11331,Question-and-Answer,"Now, the question, of course, there's a contract rent in the -- of a short booking cycle. But even here, I would say, when you look at our winter bookings, we have been reducing our program in line with capacity, in line with demand, and therefore, even in winter the cost per or the price per travel was up. So, that?s what we try -- what we will try to achieve also for summer. ",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11332,Question-and-Answer,"That?s the reason why we only plan a risk capacity of 80% despite the fact that actually Thomas Cook of course may not be there and, you know, you saw the Euromonitor, the de facto prognosis of demand is going down, let?s say something 12% to 14%. And so, you know, this 80% we are conservative and what you don't have into account of course is because the reference point is 19%. Thomas Cook was there.",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11333,Question-and-Answer,"Usually you would say, you know, 20% more bookings should be possible. So, I think we are conservative. I think we are conservative. And the reason and the result will be that our prices will be good. Now on the crews capacities we have actually a script one ship in -- at Marekka, Sebastian, right?",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11334,Question-and-Answer,Two. Six -- reduced from six to four.,Sebastian Ebel,4394041
,,,,
11335,Question-and-Answer,"Six to four so we have reduced capacity and we are seeing very good demand. I mean as soon as we can sail, the ships will be sailing. And the general sales I would say, you know, you will see a reduced capacity because also others have taken out old capacity and have not added so much new capacity. I mean not as much as planned.",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11336,Question-and-Answer,"And the German market probably will be very stable because there was unfilled demand for people go -- went to international products because the German-speaking products were sold out. So, there will be even if there would be slightly less demand, a spillover effect into German-speaking products by German customers. And therefore we kept the capacity plan from May onwards stable. It?s a little bit different in England where we're reduced from six to four ships were scraped, and that's -- we think that's the situation that we should also saw this capacity well. And we think that it will be normalized from early summer onwards.",Sebastian Ebel,4394041
,,,,
11337,Question-and-Answer,,Sebastian Ebel,4394041
,,,,
11338,Question-and-Answer,Thanks. Maybe if I could just ask one quick follow-up. You haven't mentioned the 737 Max in your presentation. When do you expect to start flying that? And can you avoid kind of the overcapacity of the airline as those planes come on?,Richard Clarke,4394041
,,,,
11339,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. The FAA has now approved and the EASA will be doing in due course, yeah? Initially, it was planned for November, but now it moved into December, maybe January. I mean, the good thing is we have been able to not only get compensation but also delay the order book, yeah, interestingly enough. So, therefore, we don't have the inflow of capacity -- significant inflow of capacity over the next 12, 18, 24 months. So, that's actually also the tick in the box. ",Sebastian Ebel,4394041
,,,,
11340,Question-and-Answer,"And interestingly enough, I would say afterwards, we believe that we will be looking into replacing capacity, not growing but placing capacity. One of the very interesting things, which are happening right now, that the replacement of old aircraft in the green deal of the EU, yeah, will be also funded by the EU. When you replace it, it?s more fuel efficient. So, it might be interesting afterwards to take capacity, but we not -- the deal we have been striking with Boeing is actually allowing us very flexible take-in rates for new aircrafts.",Sebastian Ebel,4394041
,,,,
11341,Question-and-Answer,The next question comes from the line of Adrian Pehl calling from Commerzbank. Please go ahead.,Operator,4394041
,,,,
11342,Question-and-Answer,Thanks for taking my question. Actually one is on the additional cost savings that you want to bring forward. So I was wondering the ?100 million additional savings per year. Where exactly is that coming from? Are you just doing let?s say more of the same program? Is that due to the reduced and probably forward asset base which you plan? And maybe you could elaborate a little bit further on that. ,Adrian Pehl,4394041
,,,,
11343,Question-and-Answer,"And on these asset disposals you have been addressing, actually first of all, is there a possibility to have whatever kind of sale and lease back on the Marella -- remaining Moretta Cruise Ships or is that exclusively geared towards hotels? And on the hotel side, is that just disposals or you?re really want to get rid of the likely unprofitable ones? Or are you broadly considering selling leaseback transactions on these assets? Thank you.",Adrian Pehl,4394041
,,,,
11344,Question-and-Answer,"Maybe I can start on this. I mean first of all, the ?400 million is not new, it?s just a tidying up of our program we had on the day anyway. So, when we do a program like this, we do a full program and of course our target is more than what we communicate. Because we will actually prove to you that we do ?300 million. And now we are proving to you that we are doing the ?400 million. ",Sebastian Ebel,4394041
,,,,
11345,Question-and-Answer,"So we are just tidying up. We are running in front of our curve. We have promised something we can see now, we?ve seen or that we can deliver more and therefore, we are committing more. But it's not a difficult program or a bigger program or something. It?s just what we planned. But we are now telling you and committing to more because we are more certain that we can deliver. ",Sebastian Ebel,4394041
,,,,
11346,Question-and-Answer,"Second, on Marella sale and leaseback externally is not an option. This is also very clear. So, we -- the joint venture you saw the Hapag-Lloyd think more in this direction, right. So, that actually we put the financing of balance sheet but we have the full control in the ships. And on the hotel front, I think two things are important to see.",Sebastian Ebel,4394041
,,,,
11347,Question-and-Answer,"What we don't do we just don't sell hotels and lease them back as a pure financial transaction. This is not what our plan is. Our plan is and that was also a plan which was done before the crisis, to set up financing structures to decouple the real estate business, the operations business, so Opco, Propco kind of model, right. ",Sebastian Ebel,4394041
,,,,
11348,Question-and-Answer,"And in the Propco of the real estate you have a significant part of the value and terminal value. And that is something which is not fitting our business models, right. So -- and there's enough money which actually is at the sidelines to invest here. So, therefore, you know, the separation will allow us to separate the real estate and to grow faster in our hotel portfolio because our balance sheet and our business model doesn't allow us to invest into property and it's not very efficient to do that. There's enough equity out which wants to do it. And actually, just fits to do it. It?s not our core. ",Sebastian Ebel,4394041
,,,,
11349,Question-and-Answer,,Sebastian Ebel,4394041
,,,,
11350,Question-and-Answer,"Maybe one last word and, and this is something regarding sale and leaseback. Think about more sale and manage back, yeah? Because leaseback is not very efficient. And now, exceptionally we will do it but manage back is important and also I?s important, you know, that we have the control. And this, when you look at hotel fund structure instead of just plain sale and leaseback, yeah, it's much easier to do.",Sebastian Ebel,4394041
,,,,
11351,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you for that. Maybe just a quick follow up actually as you've been probably considering such moves for quite a while and I'm probably pretty aware of the prices, I mean, I'm not quite sure if you could provide us some sort of at least qualitative indication on how asset prices on the hotel side have developed prior to the vaccine announcement and post the vaccine announcement?",Adrian Pehl,4394041
,,,,
11352,Question-and-Answer,"And post the vaccine announcement, our prices already near somewhere where you could say, well, that are reasonable prices or is the market still waiting for how the vaccine is actually playing out practically or how it lands into the summer season this year?",Adrian Pehl,4394041
,,,,
11353,Question-and-Answer,"Personally but maybe Sebastian, do you shed some light on that? I mean I think the prices never have gone down really. I mean that's what I think I saw but is it right, Sebastian, my assumption?",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11354,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, I mean there?s a very different development between city hotels and leisure hotels. The price have been very high. Maybe there have been a slight 10% decrease in the recent months but it seems to normalize again as there are so much money and leisure hotels are seen as a good investment.",Sebastian Ebel,4394041
,,,,
11355,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. So, it has not come down to the extent that you maybe -- actually, I have to say that I thought it would come down faster or more, but it seems to be that real estate investors look through the crisis.",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11356,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. That sounds comfortable. Thank you. And, Birgit, thanks for everything, and all the best for you. ",Adrian Pehl,4394041
,,,,
11357,Question-and-Answer,The final question comes from the line of Cristian Nedelcu calling from UBS. Please go ahead.,Operator,4394041
,,,,
11358,Question-and-Answer,"Hi. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Three if I may. The first one having in mind your guidance on capacity for next summer at 80%, could you give us a rough range or where do you expect the free cash flow for the company to be at the end of FY 2021? Secondly, looking at your guidance on CapEx of ?400 million to ?500 million, could you give us a bit more color what?s exactly in there and is that the new run rate going forward? ",Cristian Nedelcu,4394041
,,,,
11359,Question-and-Answer,"And thirdly, just on the -- on slide 25, if I understand well the difference for the summer 2021, the difference between total bookings and new bookings is somewhere around ?1.4 million. Now, if we try to assume most of these are vouchers, and if that is the case, can you help me reconcile this number with the value of vouchers, the ?400 million value of outstanding vouchers that you mentioned earlier? Am I missing anything here?",Cristian Nedelcu,4394041
,,,,
11360,Question-and-Answer,"Actually, maybe, Sebastian, it's mainly -- I think we are not guiding, but just to make sure that I don't say wrong things.",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11361,Question-and-Answer,"Maybe on CapEx, as I said, we will be very tight on investments. So, for the time being, this is the upper end of what we want to achieve. So, there we don't expect today an increase in the foreseeable future. ",Sebastian Ebel,4394041
,,,,
11362,Question-and-Answer,"On the free cash flow, there was a one question on free cash flow I?m?",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11363,Question-and-Answer,We don?t guide. ,Sebastian Ebel,4394041
,,,,
11364,Question-and-Answer,We don?t guide. No. ,Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11365,Question-and-Answer,"We don?t guide. It?s a very -- I mean, it's almost impossible to really judge this.",Sebastian Ebel,4394041
,,,,
11366,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. Okay. So, what was -- and there was -- what part of actually the 1.4 or whatever, the difference between new bookings and net bookings is covered by vouchers. What part of that covers the vouchers? And is that something we -- I mean, top of my head I don't know. But in our sense do we know and [indiscernible] ",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11367,Question-and-Answer,,Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11368,Question-and-Answer,"It had been ?55 percent. But of course, now as the new bookings come in, this picture now is completely changing because the ones who wanted to rebook and use the voucher have mainly done it. So, from what we do see with the new bookings it will go up to 80%, 85% real new bookings and 10% still going for a voucher or rebooking. So, the good effect is growing out. ",Sebastian Ebel,4394041
,,,,
11369,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. I don?t know. It works, but what is important thing, I mean, also having the vouchers actually tied into the system that new bookings is extremely important because lots of unused vouchers are also not very good. Okay. Does that answer your question, Cristian?",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11370,Question-and-Answer,Yeah. Yeah. ,Cristian Nedelcu,4394041
,,,,
11371,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you. Thank you. That was the last question I think. Thank you very much everybody for staying -- for being on the line and listening in. I want to say on this side also, thank you very much, Birgit, again, you know you obviously did a good job. You know people, thank you on the call. I want to thank -- personal thanks to you. It was a great, a very constructive and good companionship, running the company. Unfortunately, crisis you don't consider your tenure or not. And therefore, it came, the COVID crisis came unfortunate. I wish you all the best. ",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11372,Question-and-Answer,"And I would also have to say that Sebastian and I, we worked together for quite some while and in different functions. And I'm equally happy that Sebastian now takes this new very, very important role in restructuring our balance sheet. Of course liquidity now should be there to manage through the crisis budget but the balance sheet is a task. And of course we will have 18 months to do that. That's plenty of time, I believe.",Friedrich Joussen,4394041
,,,,
11373,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you very much, everybody for listening in and talk to you soon.",Friedrich Joussen,4394041

,,,,
11375,Presentation,"Thank you for listening to the J.Jill Third Quarter Fiscal 2020 Earnings Commentary. Jim Scully, Interim CEO and Mark Webb, Executive Vice President and CFO will provide further remarks on the company's fiscal third quarter results ended October 31, 2020, which were announced with the press release dated December 10, 2020. Following today's remarks, there will be no question-and-answer session.",Operator,4394039

,,,,
11378,Presentation,I will now turn the remarks over to Jim.,Operator,4394039
,,,,
11379,Presentation,"Thank you and good morning, everyone. When I first spoke with you the same time last year, we had made leadership changes and were setting a plan for strengthening J Jill's foundation. Then very early in 2020, we began to navigate the challenges presented from the COVID-19 pandemic that the world is still facing today. It is an understatement to say that this has been an unprecedented year for retail and for J Jill.",Jim Scully,4394039
,,,,
11380,Presentation,"With that said, while our results have yet to show a meaningful recovery and our core customer remains cautious, we are gradually making sequential improvement. Importantly, during the third quarter, we made significant progress in positioning J Jill for its next chapter, including our previously announced agreement with our lenders, which provides us the needed flexibility to build our path back to profitable growth as well as the announcement of our permanent CEO, Claire Spofford who will begin her role early next year.",Jim Scully,4394039
,,,,
11381,Presentation,"In addition to these announcements, we've also reevaluated our operating model and taken several steps to strengthen for the future. We are optimizing our product assortment and streamlining the number of product flows which will improve the efficiency of product development activities as well as store and e-commerce operations. We've reviewed our marketing mix, reducing the number of important but expensive catalog drops to be in line with the new product flows.",Jim Scully,4394039
,,,,
11382,Presentation,"We've adjusted our organizational overhead to reflect a simplified way of working and we've reviewed our historically strong store fleet with a critical eye on traffic and revenue potential and made tough decisions to close lower performing, predominately mall-based stores. At J Jill and bars [ph] on its next chapter, I'm excited to have Claire join as permanent CEO beginning in early February.",Jim Scully,4394039
,,,,
11383,Presentation,"Claire is returning to the company with a strong knowledge of J Jill's incredible, loyal customer base and has a proven track record of evolving brands into profitable, usually [ph] driven businesses. As I transition back to my role as Director, I look forward to continuing to work with Claire and the rest of the team as I continue to believe in the power that is yet to be unlocked from this brand.",Jim Scully,4394039
,,,,
11384,Presentation,,Jim Scully,4394039
,,,,
11385,Presentation,I will now turn the call over to Mark to review our results and provide more detail with regards to our financial and operating restructure. Mark?,Jim Scully,4394039
,,,,
11386,Presentation,"Thank you, Jim and on behalf of all the teams, I'd like to thank you for your leadership over the past year. As Jim noted, the COVID-19 pandemic has created unique challenges this year. In response to these challenges, we have taken deliberate actions that not only helped us survive such uncertain times, but we believe have put us in a position of strength once the pandemic subsides.",Mark Webb,4394039
,,,,
11387,Presentation,"We strengthened the balance sheet, we extend the maturity on almost 98% of our term loan debt by two years to 2024, we amended our debt covenants with our lenders obtaining a leverage ratio holiday for Q4 2021 with more lenient leverage ratios initially upon reinstatement and a minimum liquidity covenant was instituted to put focus on this most important metric in the short-term. And finally we issued a new junior term loan and paid down our evolving loan facility, all of which provide us liquidity and breathing room to continue to execute our foundation billing strategies with total liquidity measured as bank cash plus ABL availability of over $53 million at the end of the third quarter.",Mark Webb,4394039
,,,,
11388,Presentation,"Over the coming years J Jill should be well-positioned to take advantage of profitable growth opportunities. Operationally, we've aggressively managed inventories. We canceled orders where possible and reallocated units from stores to the rest to better align supply with demand and as necessary, we took markdowns and carved out units for third-party liquidation in order to end 2020 as clean as possible to enable us to position for recovery in 2021. The gross margin in Q3 reflects these actions with the majority of the 550 basis point decline coming from tariff activities including the impact of third-party liquidations.",Mark Webb,4394039
,,,,
11389,Presentation,End of quarter inventories finished down almost 17% compared to last year. We will continue to be aggressive with inventory management this year with the goal of starting fiscal 2021 with inventories well-positioned to support average unit retail and gross margin recovery. We also reviewed our store fleet in light of performance impacts from the pandemic and made the decision to close up to 20 stores this year 11 of which have already closed through the end of the third quarter.,Mark Webb,4394039
,,,,
11390,Presentation,We will continue to review the fleet in 2021 for further optimization opportunities. We believe physical stores are critical channel for J Jill and do not rule out a return to store growth in the future once the full effect of the pandemic on malls and customer shopping patterns is understood. We believe that the actions we've taken including those that Jim reviewed will contribute to a stronger foundation from which J Jill can grow in the future.,Mark Webb,4394039
,,,,
11391,Presentation,Now let me quickly cover a few key highlights from our third quarter performance. Third-quarter revenue sequentially improved compared to second quarter achieving 70% of last year's sales levels. All stores were open as of the start of the quarter though many operated on reduced operating hours to control variable costs as store demand continue to recover. Direct revenues were up 4% for the quarter and penetration remains quite healthy at 63% of total sales.,Mark Webb,4394039
,,,,
11392,Presentation,"With regards to profitability, as previously mentioned, gross margin of 58.9% was primarily impacted by actions taken to manage inventory aggressively to set J Jill up for recovery in 2021. SG&A expenses were down $6 million compared to last year, despite $13 million of nonrecurring expenses primarily driven by transaction-related costs incurred during the quarter. Expense savings were driven by reduced marketing spend, lower store selling costs associated with fewer operating hours and reductions in overhead headcount.",Mark Webb,4394039
,,,,
11393,Presentation,,Mark Webb,4394039
,,,,
11394,Presentation,"In summary, we've taken many actions this year that we believe strengthen the operational foundation of the company. We know there is much work to be done and uncertainty remains in the macro environment related to the COVID-19 pandemic, but with improved operational discipline and greater financial flexibility we are confident that the steps we've taken will set us up well in 2021 and beyond.",Mark Webb,4394039
,,,,
11395,Presentation,I will now turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks. Jim?,Mark Webb,4394039
,,,,
11396,Presentation,"While this year presented incredible challenges to the organization, I'm so proud of everyone's efforts and dedication during this time. I want to thank all of our teams for their hard work wish everyone a happy and healthy holiday season.",Jim Scully,4394039

,,,,
11406,Presentation,"With that, I will turn the call over to the operator to begin our Q&A session. Operator, we are ready for questions.",Allison Malkin,4393997
,,,,
11407,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Adrienne Yih of Barclays. Your line is open.,Operator,4393997
,,,,
11408,Question-and-Answer,"Great. Thank you very much. Good afternoon. And I just have to say, wow. I mean, this is a really remarkable performance. So congratulations to everybody at RH. Gary, I guess, my first question for you is, in the past you have mentioned two macro drivers that benefit the company. One, being kind of high-end housing growth and the second being robust stock market returns to where the market that we have both. And based on the historical perspective, how long have the -- what?s been the lag in terms of the effect, and obviously, we are seeing it sort of immediate today. But what?s been the duration of the positive impact to your business from that? And then my second question is, the sales galleries in Europe, what size will they be and how should we think about, I guess, the annual sales contribution of each of those? Thank you very much and congratulations.",Adrienne Yih,4393997
,,,,
11409,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you. Thank you. It?s hard to be specific on duration. I think it depends on severity of correction in any of the markets. Particularly we have seen, as you know, with sharp stock market moves sometimes will pause consumers at the high end. So it?s hard for us to kind of give you a number or range there. But I?d say, there?s nothing different than how you might assume the consumers would behave depending on the severity of the changes in a marketplace.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11410,Question-and-Answer,,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11411,Question-and-Answer,"I would say, we see a very healthy home market, right? And I have been asked recently about Keith, how do you feel about the cities you have galleries in that are consumers or moving out of some of the key dense cities based on the pandemic and there a boom in the suburban housing market in the second home housing market.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11412,Question-and-Answer,"We are generally -- I would just say, we are generally indifferent, because people moving and buying homes is just a good thing, right? We have galleries in every major market. So that will all kind of balance itself out and our key market galleries like New York tend to draw from the broader suburbs and everywhere, because it?s where our best assortment is.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11413,Question-and-Answer,"But this -- the uptick in the housing market and how long that will last? Again, we don?t have a crystal ball. There?s usually a longer tail there, because as anybody on the phone knows, if you have bought a new house or moved into a new house and it triggers a lot of spending on the home and it?s not an easy job.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11414,Question-and-Answer,Yeah.,Adrienne Yih,4393997
,,,,
11415,Question-and-Answer,It takes a long time. So we think that the tail from just the housing market move looks pretty good. It?s hard to say today what?s going to happen with the stock market and how the market is going to read what happens next in the pandemic.,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11416,Question-and-Answer,"It?s hard for us to understand how the market will cycle through the stay-at-home stocks, as they call them versus others. And we just -- we try not to get too focused on those things we can?t control.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11417,Question-and-Answer,"But as you think about the galleries in Europe and how you should think about that the sales contribution. We think it?s very different obviously from the perspective of work. If you think about the U.S., when we opened a new gallery almost all of them are replacing an existing gallery.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11418,Question-and-Answer,So there?s something very good about that and there is -- yet from the perspective that there?s little risk and we have a lot of history. We know we have a gallery that?s doing $18 million and we open a new gallery that has hospitality generally in the first 12 months to 36 months. It will double to $36 million and we have a point of reference in each of those markets.,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11419,Question-and-Answer,"But when you think about opening it internationally, we are not replacing any stores. So you have a bit of an unknown on that end. But -- and that can be a negative, because there?s more guesswork and there?s less data to use.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11420,Question-and-Answer,"Again, we are relatively very accurate on understanding what?s going to happen with our expansion in the U.S. and even where we have hit new markets so we opened in the U.S. we are relatively accurate in predicting the performance. So we had less data internationally. We don?t know exactly what the reaction will be. But and so that?s a negative.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11421,Question-and-Answer,"I?d say on the positive the way to think about it is, you are not opening a market, you are opening a country, right? And so I think about it from the perspective of the U.K., just if you start there. California today, call it, directionally a $500 million market for the business without all the gallery conversions.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11422,Question-and-Answer,"Longer term, probably a $700 million-plus market for RH, probably, as we continue to expand the assortments and become a more disruptive, dominant brand, help California long term, maybe it?s close to $1 billion, $800 million, but easy to see $700 million as you think about transforming California.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11423,Question-and-Answer,"Well, take the U.K., a 68 million people, right, versus California with 39 people -- 39 million people. You have got similar demographics, similar wealth populations, and so on and so forth, little change in the density.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11424,Question-and-Answer,"So you open a gallery in England, London, or whatnot and we have got kind of a unique strategy there. We are opening a really terrific gallery from an image and impact and kind of conversation point of view, RH England, which is this magnificent estate on 73 acres in Oxfordshire. It?s five minutes from the Soho Farmhouse. It?s been called the coolest house in Great Britain.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11425,Question-and-Answer,,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11426,Question-and-Answer,And -- but it?s kind of out from the population. It will create a lot of awareness of the brand and just because of the footprint and the uniqueness of the gallery and it?s got a great size of -- I think of 50 something thousand square feet there and the three buildings.,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11427,Question-and-Answer,"And then you have a very different one in central London in Mayfair, right, where we are right in the heart of it and we are framed by Savile Row and Burlington Gardens and we are block off New Bond Street and the flagship Ralph Lauren and the big project that LVMH is doing.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11428,Question-and-Answer,"And no one?s going to -- and all the wealthy people, no one will miss us there. I think everybody will hear about us in Oxfordshire. How many people will go? Not sure. But the way to think about it is not just as you are always you are opening up the entire direct market, right?",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11429,Question-and-Answer,"And we have always been a brand. We used to refer to our self as a direct centric brand. If you think about and it?s funny because I just wrote about physical first strength. And at some -- and it?s that -- and certain people think, oh, he doesn?t believe in the Internet, because he?s building these big stores, these big galleries. But the way we got to even be where we are today is we did that through the direct business, right?",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11430,Question-and-Answer,"When we started here, where these little stores and we had a little assortment and there?s no way you could show our assortment in the 6,000 of selling or 7,000 square feet of selling. We had the average galleries and we had a strategy that we used to talk about kind of first leg as a public company and didn?t talk about it so much when we reentered the public market. But we still talk about direct center growth.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11431,Question-and-Answer,"What we meant by that is we said, we were going to size the assortments to the potential of the market, not limit them to decide to the store. And use the stores and the website to reach a much broader market. And by doing that, we were able to grow the company, a company that was on the edge of bankruptcy in a very capital efficient way.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11432,Question-and-Answer,"And that is going to kind of play through when you think about moving into new countries, right? Here we started with 106 stores and we kind of right sized it down that we think kind of it was 60, 70, whatever it will end up being as we optimize the footprint.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11433,Question-and-Answer,"I don?t know if we have to have as many galleries in Europe, right, with because the Internet continues to be a better and better tool to shop or to convert, right? And so if you are well positioned you may not need as many physical stores. It?s just that today we know what the physical stores do. We know we can double the business in every market and from retail point of view.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11434,Question-and-Answer,"So when you open up a gallery or two in England again and greater the U.K., we open up a gallery in Paris, right? You are going to open up all of France and greater parts of Europe. We are going to open up your business to all the travelers. And so we are not sure exactly how to think about that until we until we have a couple.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11435,Question-and-Answer,"But I?d say the asymmetrical risk to the upside from how we think about our business, because we have been a company that had yeah before we are transforming our galleries when our galleries were undersized. We have 50% of our business was direct to customer, omnichannel, digital first, whatever you want to call it. We just call it online or on our website it?s where it?s transacted.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11436,Question-and-Answer,"And so we believe opening up markets is -- opening up countries is a big deal, a really big deal. And that I think gives us asymmetrical risk to the upside, downside of maybe not having as much specific data, right?",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11437,Question-and-Answer,"Like it would be like that?s being the brand start today where kind of the awareness we have today and opening up California with a magnificent store in LA, right, at an incredible gallery, I don?t know, call it in the Napa Valley or somewhere that people visit vacation and go to for weekends. So what does that do? We think it?s some kind of a really good outcome would be our best use today.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11438,Question-and-Answer,,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11439,Question-and-Answer,That?s very helpful. Thank you very much.,Adrienne Yih,4393997
,,,,
11440,Question-and-Answer,Yeah.,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11441,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Max Rakhlenko of Cowen and Company. Your line is open.,Operator,4393997
,,,,
11442,Question-and-Answer,"Hey, guys. Thanks a lot for taking my question and congrats on the nice quarter. So it?s really good to see that your cancel rates are below last year. Do you think that that could remain the case over the coming or could there be some risk as supply will trail demand for a bit longer than you previously anticipated? And then just separately, how are you guys thinking about cash allocation priorities at this point? Your free cash flow is starting to ramp and with fewer major capital heavy projects, as well as debt maturities, do you think we could see accelerated share repurchase, special dividends M&A? Just want to hear your thoughts on that? Thank you.",Max Rakhlenko,4393997
,,,,
11443,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. The cancel rates have been down for several quarters now. So the trend would indicate that there?s not a risk, right? That the -- and I think there?s not a risk because, one, because I don?t think we have a lot of direct competition at our -- where we are in the market. We are one of the few people that stock higher end luxury home furnishings. In most places, it?s a much longer wait time custom, etcetera, etcetera.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11444,Question-and-Answer,"And I think that the consumer needs the product and I just don?t think anybody else is in stock, right? I mean, we are running the highest back orders in the history of the company since I have been here 20 years now. So I have never seen this kind of phenomenon, right? I have never seen back orders at all-time highs and cancel rates at almost all-time lows, right?",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11445,Question-and-Answer,"So, one, is that tells you the consumer probably doesn?t have a lot of other choices, what choices they perceive they have, also don?t have product to ship right away. And they really need the product, so they are, in many cases, forced to wait, right? So you kind of go, God, if I don?t order it now, how long might I wait, right? How many more weeks might the delay be?",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11446,Question-and-Answer,"So the numbers would tell you over the last few quarters that there doesn?t look like a risk. That doesn?t mean things won?t change. I just don?t see any reason for them to change. So our degree of confidence of converting the orders to revenues is very, very high, right?",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11447,Question-and-Answer,"We have a lot of data now and very, very consistent back orders trends lower not higher, back orders have been below a year ago and they were low -- and that?s why back orders, excuse me, cancel rates below a year ago and they are below a year ago last year.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11448,Question-and-Answer,"And as backorders have increased every quarter, right? Because you can?t, when else are obviously started trending up, we weren?t buying for us, while we have cancelled orders so when they started trending up 20%, we are buying for 20%. Also they went up 30% and then you -- they are buying for 30% and then go 40%, like, God, way and buy for 40%. Let me ask wait a few more weeks and then you go, okay, it looks like a trend that you buy 40%.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11449,Question-and-Answer,"So we have on a compounded basis and then they went up to 47%, right? So we kind of got behind, right? So as we thought we would start catching up, we also -- we actually fell behind because the demand continued to accelerate and you would have thought that cancel rates would be impacted.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11450,Question-and-Answer,But for the reasons I stated I believe that they are haven?t been impacted and now I kind of have a more firm view that I don?t believe they will be. It doesn?t mean we won?t be wrong about that but that?s our view today.,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11451,Question-and-Answer,"And as we think about cash allocation priorities, look, we are in a world where things are changing daily, right? Again, we are -- we just went into the State of California shelter-in-place orders, right? Retail is operating at 20% capacity. The malls and shopping centers have less traffic than they have had in the last few months. We just saw the most severe drop off of the Black Friday to Cyber Monday selling seasons that we have ever seen.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11452,Question-and-Answer,,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11453,Question-and-Answer,"And in discussing with other retailers and leaders in the business, people saw a massive fall off during that period, like, we are sitting here going, oh, like, we just orders is the tailwind over and it just seemed that based on the fact that that the virus was spiking, people decided not to go out and shop and all of a sudden, once we get past Cyber Monday, our business started to ramp back up.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11454,Question-and-Answer,"So when you are in that kind of a business situation with so many unknowns that we are in, whether you have a headwind or tailwind, it doesn?t -- for me it doesn?t really matter. I mean we have more optionality with the tailwind.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11455,Question-and-Answer,"And I -- do I feel better being on this side of the table than maybe apparel people or other people had their business or restaurants and other people had their business devastated? Yeah, of course choose the side we are on.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11456,Question-and-Answer,"But it doesn?t mean you should adjust anything long-term. It means you should just kind of do your best day-to-day, week-to-week, month-to-month as new data comes in to make really good decisions for what you know and don?t lose sight of your long-term vision and strategies that will create -- that you believe will create significant shareholder value long-term.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11457,Question-and-Answer,And I think we have proven based on big decisions we have made and from moving from a promotional model to a membership. Again when I talked about having much too help for heavily cause and staying true to that and transforming our whole way of doing business. That was a long-term view and we didn?t let short-term noise distract us.,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11458,Question-and-Answer,"We redesigned and re-architected the entire operating platform of the company and a lot of short-term noise as we were doing that. We stayed focused on where -- how we could create long-term value and that?s hasn?t changed. And that?s why I wrote one of my longer shareholder letters here, try to give you as much detail as we could how -- as transparent as we can how we are seeing the business, but things are changing all the time.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11459,Question-and-Answer,"So to kind of have a strong view about what you are going to do from a capital allocation point of view, buybacks or M&A or other things, like, we are always going to be opportunistic. But I -- it?s just hard to kind of commit to too many things today.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11460,Question-and-Answer,"I mean, we were pretty certain we were going to open RH England and all of a sudden travel shuts down in the U.K. and we can?t go unless we quarantined for two weeks. And you can?t send your leadership team and other people to go quarantine in a hotel for two weeks, to work two days and come back.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11461,Question-and-Answer,"And so we just decided, like, yeah, it?s not a good time. We had to make a decision to commit to distribution infrastructure and other investments and people and so on and so forth. And we said, like, look, it?s important that we take a long-term view here. The long-term view is like everybody will still be there if we wait to ?22. We will be more prepared. We will do a better job. We will have more visibility. We will understand what this looks like on the other side of the pandemic.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11462,Question-and-Answer,"So, right now, I?d just say, too many moving parts to be committed to kind of any kind of specific activity. If the right thing comes along that had asymmetrical risk to the upside that there?s real opportunity, we will do those things.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11463,Question-and-Answer,"And we have made some small acquisitions, I think, you will read about in our filings, they are not really material. But we are taking opportunities to do things that will elevate the brand and invest in the brand and we will continue to do things like that.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11464,Question-and-Answer,"Where we going to make significant share buybacks with all the uncertainty? I don?t think so. Not right now. I think let?s let things pass and just no different than look I think we are very smart at not raising debt right away and we -- when also this pandemic hit and our business went down, our business moved 50 points, right?",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11465,Question-and-Answer,,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11466,Question-and-Answer,Everybody is like you don?t have enough cash. It?s what -- this look like and we researched it. We created a lot of optionality. We had a lot of choices to raise capital. The interest rates would have been really high. It would have been very expensive money and it might have bought us some optionality. But you just don?t need to take risk without having real clear visibility.,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11467,Question-and-Answer,"I mean some people thought we took a big risk buying back almost 60% of the company at $1.2 billion. We didn?t see this risky, right? Because we understood what was going to happen. We understood we were going to -- we architect the supply chain. It takes $400 million to $500 million out of inventory.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11468,Question-and-Answer,"We knew what would happen. We had really good assumptions. I?d say we knew, like, really good assumptions. We knew our business really well and we made some moves that to other people, looked risky, to us had more asymmetrical risk to the upside.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11469,Question-and-Answer,"And so, right now, I think, it?s just -- we are in a really uncertain time. We gave you as much forward-looking information as we could, tried to -- I kind of look at this as it?s -- look at this over a two-year period, right?",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11470,Question-and-Answer,"Fiscal ?21 is a, excuse me, fiscal ?20 is a down first half, up second half. Fiscal ?21 is just the opposite. I?d look at the two years together and say, what kind of company do you think you have when you balance it all out? We think this is a company on its way to being one of the great companies and that?s what we are focused on. So that?s how I?d characterize our frame of mind today.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11471,Question-and-Answer,"Got it. Thanks a lot, Gary, and happy holidays to everyone.",Max Rakhlenko,4393997
,,,,
11472,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. Happy holidays to you.,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11473,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Forbes of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.,Operator,4393997
,,,,
11474,Question-and-Answer,"Good afternoon. Hey, Gary. Maybe to start, on the last call, you talked a lot about the reallocation of human and financial capital, right? And I wonder if you can provide more context around the potential benefits here, right, as you digest those moves and is the launch of RH Contemporary, right, and RH Color like a result of these efforts or how do you sort of speak to the potential benefits, right, of that strategic change and not dropping the sourcebook in the fall?",Steven Forbes,4393997
,,,,
11475,Question-and-Answer,"Sure. Well, not dropping the sourcebook in the fall was a decision based on the fact that inventory was chasing demand massively and we were only going to create a greater pressure and possibly not satisfied, just have customers frustrated with ads and so on and so forth.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11476,Question-and-Answer,"So we give up topline in by not mailing a book? Sure, we did. If we were to mail the books, would there have been incremental toplines? There would have. Would there been higher backorders? There would have. Would there have been more frustrated customers in wait times? There would have.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11477,Question-and-Answer,"And so we thought the right long-term move was not to try to chase this kind of optimize the business in this time of the pandemic, like, how to shift our human capital and focus on the longer term.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11478,Question-and-Answer,"And so we reallocated our time and energy towards other things contemporary being one of them. We held back newness, right, that would have been generating demand today. I feel really good that demand in the core businesses bounce back to what is up 39, right? Up 39 with no books, right, with no newness. So we are up against last year?s book. We are up against last year?s newness and we are still up 39.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11479,Question-and-Answer,"And so could we been 48 or 52? I don?t know, maybe. But our business would have been messier. And it?s never good to kind of create a messy business. I mean, I have run those before. This company has run in a messy way before in a chaotic way.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11480,Question-and-Answer,It?s no different than -- it?s pretty clear if you just look at the emails you receive in your inbox is that there is a period where very few people were promoting. Now it looks like a period of a lot of promotions.,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11481,Question-and-Answer,,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11482,Question-and-Answer,"And so my sense is there?s a lot of people in the retail business that are trying to fuel the fire with increased promotions. I think that?s a -- I think that?s not a good long-term view, because then you are up against all that next year when you have got a cycle of these difficult comparisons, I look at next -- I look ahead next year and I feel really good. We have got a cycle demand up 40. Maybe this fourth quarter will be less than that because we didn?t mail the books and we don?t have the newness.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11483,Question-and-Answer,"But next year we are going to have a lot of newness and we are going to have really thoughtful, constructed and architected assortments, and we will even be more strategic and we will be able to make investments in other elements of our business that will elevate the brand. And so we feel very good next year -- about next year unless something big happens. Thus, we have a stock market crash and the bottom falls out of the home business.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11484,Question-and-Answer,"But, for the most part, I?d like next year is shaping up because of the decisions we have made. I think we are very excited. I think there?s tremendous new products in the pipeline, almost too much.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11485,Question-and-Answer,"We have to make sure we have been disciplined about our investments from an inventory point of view and our risk, our newness, but it?s a lot of great newness. And I think RH could temporary is going to open up an entirely another new layer of the market, right, that for us.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11486,Question-and-Answer,"It?s going to bridge the gap between the kind of class -- updated classics of interiors and the more harder edge modern and fill in with some aesthetics that we just hadn?t pursued before in a very RH way, right, through our own unique point of view and I think it?s going to be really exciting to the consumer.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11487,Question-and-Answer,And we have got some tremendous new talent from a design and artisan point of view coming onto the platform. I don?t know if anybody?s picked up the new Architectural Digest. But you will read a two page article about Alison Berger coming under our platform with some incredible new lighting designs.,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11488,Question-and-Answer,"And Alison is known as one of the great lighting designers and glass designers in the world today. I mean, yeah, she sold exclusively on Holly Hunt?s platform, which Holly Hunt had been known as the best high-end interior design showroom in the United States.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11489,Question-and-Answer,"And you have someone like Alison come over to our platform kind of fix things again, right? And -- but it just about the product and the people joining the platform and the people joining the cause. There?s just a lot of momentum in our brand today.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11490,Question-and-Answer,"From a human capital point of view, both inside and outside RH that are going to contribute to RH. From design, manufacturing, business intellect and merchandising capability and so on so forth.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11491,Question-and-Answer,"So I guess the way to think about it is there?s got to be a balancing, right, kind of not mailing the books and not having any newness and then cycling around next year. And not just mailing the books, but mailing more books, right, and with more unit because you are going to have contemporary and you are going to have this kind of upward momentum.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11492,Question-and-Answer,Now what will happen to the markets? Do we think some air is going to come out of the demand? Do we think this -- you can?t -- it would be foolish to think like this thing last for a real long time not at this level.,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11493,Question-and-Answer,"Like, we think it?s -- you are going to cycle it. It?s going to normalize. There?s going to still be momentum in the home business from our point of view because of the long tail and that happens when people buy homes and move.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11494,Question-and-Answer,"But the long-term, if you just think about the moves we are making strategically, those are not temporal. The pandemic is temporal, right? The moves we are making are systemic and strategic and they are going to last a long time. So that?s what we are focused on.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11495,Question-and-Answer,,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11496,Question-and-Answer,"One of the moves we are making, the investments we are making that are going to elevate the RH brand and render our brand more valuable in the marketplace, more desirable, more unique, more authentic. And that are going to have a lasting value, because it?s -- look, our stock went up $120 or $130 in the last 30 days or something like that.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11497,Question-and-Answer,"Like I -- the stock is going to move around. You are going to have like the short-term stuff is, you get to focus on that and you start kind of managing your business, right? And manager generally arrange and organize the status quo and try to protect the present.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11498,Question-and-Answer,"We are builders here. We don?t have anybody with a title of Manager in this company. We only have leaders. And leaders are taking people somewhere they have never been, doing things they have never done, right? And they are building things and they are building value, and that?s the culture of our company.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11499,Question-and-Answer,"If you walked in our Center of Innovation, you?d walk through a portal that says, RH, the home of the extraordinary, the remarkable and the amazing, right, because that?s how we think, right? What are we focused on that?s extraordinary, remarkable and amazing?",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11500,Question-and-Answer,That?s the kind of work -- that?s kind of focus you have to have to build one of the most admired brands in the world and that?s our DNA. That?s our focus. So all the other stuff is kind of noise and distractions. The important things are the big moves and the big investments that are going to continue to change everything for a very long time.,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11501,Question-and-Answer,"And then maybe just a quick follow-up for Jack. I don?t know if you can sort of speak to what?s the right level of expenses as we look out to 2021 or if you just want to sort of based on the third quarter here and maybe help us conceptualize what some of the transitory factors were, right, like the removal of the sales structure and so forth as we think about our 2021 models?",Steven Forbes,4393997
,,,,
11502,Question-and-Answer,"We don?t give guidance. We gave you our outlook and I think it reflects our confidence in the business and the sort of operating structure. And look, some of the things I look to continue to strengthen in gross margin and product margin, like that is a strong part of the story.",Jack Preston,4393997
,,,,
11503,Question-and-Answer,"And when we look out and our confidence to reach the 25% margin in our outlook -- our longer term outlook, I mean, that -- those are the strong elements of the story. As far as like specific elements in 2021, we are not in a position to provide at this time. I will look at Gary if there?s anything else.",Jack Preston,4393997
,,,,
11504,Question-and-Answer,"No. I mean, what we believe we are going to have a double-digit revenue growth and expanding operating margins. We will know more each week, each month as the pandemic kind of plays out here and the world returns to some kind of a more normalized environment for people, how people are going to behave and what?s going to happen.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11505,Question-and-Answer,"But -- we are not going to get out over our SKUs from a cost point of view, right? And if we had -- you can?t tell, so we are in kind of a temporal environment. You have got to be smart about that. So that?s why we feel confident that the margins will continue to expand because we have got a good handle on expenses and we have a good line of sight into the product pipeline and what we believe can be the margin structure from a product point of view, which is the key lever.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11506,Question-and-Answer,"And expenses, we were pretty disciplined around here from an investment point of view. It?s a -- we tend to have a culture that doesn?t spend money. We have a culture that invests money based on what we think the return with that investment, what kind of return will that generate.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11507,Question-and-Answer,"So, as long as we keep that discipline and we don?t become complacent or arrogant, based on business trends that are happening today. We keep our edge. We continue to be unsatisfied, serious, critical, always unfinished, always on the move and we will continue to do great work. So I don?t think there?s any other people that are giving you much more data than we are giving you today. So I think our -- the shareholder letter has a lot in it.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11508,Question-and-Answer,,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11509,Question-and-Answer,Thank you both. Happy holidays.,Steven Forbes,4393997
,,,,
11510,Question-and-Answer,"Happy holidays, Steve.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11511,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. Our next question comes from Chuck Grom of Gordon Haskett. Your line is open.,Operator,4393997
,,,,
11512,Question-and-Answer,"Hey. Thanks. Good evening. Can you guys put into some context how big of an opportunity the outdoor furniture market could be for you guys? And then, for Jack, just trying to understand the connection between deferred revenue and customer deposits in your balance sheet there, I believe over 60% year-over-year and then your demand comp, which is lower than that. Just wondering if you could connect those two dots for us?",Chuck Grom,4393997
,,,,
11513,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. I think, look, outdoor, I?d say, outdoor business is a lot like the general RH business. I think when you build a brand like ours you in many ways are creating a market. And yeah, you are inspiring people to purchase and invest versus other purchases and investments they may have made based on what they see.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11514,Question-and-Answer,"And no different than Apple created a new market, they didn?t look the cellphone market, and say, how big -- I mean, Apple create an entirely new market around smartphones and the iPhone. Nobody thought it would sell in China. It became the bestselling phone in China.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11515,Question-and-Answer,"When you create a really good product and not just a single product, I am talking about a full integrated branded proposition. You have an opportunity to create a new market, right? To disproportionately expand a market because you are putting something out there that wasn?t there before, right? And I think that?s happening in many places, right? And look at a lot of brands that are creating new markets.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11516,Question-and-Answer,"So in outdoor, it?s much of the same. If you just stood back and said, where do you go buy outdoor furniture? There?s not a lot of consumer facing outdoor furniture stores, right? They are kind of out off the beaten trail kind of in weird places. You can come up with the names you have driven by them before.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11517,Question-and-Answer,"But if you said it?s the high-end outdoor furniture, where do you go? Where do you even see it? Where do you even get inspired to buy it? It?s -- no one really presents it, because it tends to be more seasonal in nature as far as the peaks of the business.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11518,Question-and-Answer,"I used to joke around and tell people is what -- you might remember that this was called Smith & Hawken, right? And they opened like 50 stores and then almost went bankrupt. And they took another go at it.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11519,Question-and-Answer,"And I?d say why didn?t Smith & Hawken?s make any money? And I say, jeez, well, I don?t know, I said. Well, for the most part they had to pay rent, right? And they paid ground for rent for a very seasonal business.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11520,Question-and-Answer,"And if you look at our strategy and what we have done with rooftops and terraces and things like that, we -- in our new galleries we present somewhere between 20 and 30 outdoor collections depending on the outdoor garden space and the rooftop space.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11521,Question-and-Answer,"Nobody faces the customer like that in the outdoor furniture business. Because we are facing the customer like that in this current environment, we are creating a new market. And we are creating a new market in the outdoor furniture at a very high return on invested capital.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11522,Question-and-Answer,"So we really liked that business and say, well, why can?t other people do that. Well, other people don?t build galleries as big as we do. So their rooftops could never be as big, right? They don?t control the real estate like we do and they don?t -- it?s very hard to emulate what we are doing, right, and that?s -- and why the physical nature of our business is so important, right?",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11523,Question-and-Answer,"Like, I would say, the -- a website is an invisible store, right? You don?t see it. You don?t pass it. You have to be prompted to go to it. And this physical stores, people drive by they see -- if you are in the right locations, you are in the -- you are going to be constantly visible and you can present products and categories in ways that you can?t online.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11524,Question-and-Answer,,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11525,Question-and-Answer,"Where the online -- and online, this is very democratic, right? We -- everybody has the same size screen, again, probably, some store can look as big as RH online. And I don?t want to say Holly?s home stores. Nobody named Holly. It?s just refers to a higher end local furniture, specialty store that someone?s running.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11526,Question-and-Answer,"And -- but those kind of businesses can?t do what we do and that?s why we are so disruptive. So when you are disrupted like that, you are taking share. But even most -- more importantly than taking share, you are creating a new market and that?s how we think about it. And then, Jack, maybe you can comment on if you ?",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11527,Question-and-Answer,Yeah.,Jack Preston,4393997
,,,,
11528,Question-and-Answer,?deposits and revenue.,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11529,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. I mean, obviously, with the strength of the business and the high demand and the supply chain constraints we talked about, those are the two items -- two key items that you are going to see that grow with customer deposits and sort of deferred -- the special order business that we have that grows those customer deposits. And then as the business grows, naturally you are going to have a growth in the deferred revenue balance.",Jack Preston,4393997
,,,,
11530,Question-and-Answer,"You are looking year-over-year. I would have you look sort of sequentially sort of where Q2 to Q3 grew as well. That?s a -- that was like an 18% sequential build. So I think you are going to look at both, don?t get me wrong. But I think as far as impact from walking down from demand down to revenue growth, you kind of want to look at that sequential build. So, like I said, that was an 18% growth and very much expected relative to the trajectory of the business.",Jack Preston,4393997
,,,,
11531,Question-and-Answer,That?s a good color. I will look at it sequentially then. And then just my follow-up would be just wondering if you guys and it?s probably a little bit more art than science. But just any sense for how much of your revenue growth is coming from consumers who are actually buying second homes and/or people who are shifting out of cities into larger suburban homes?,Chuck Grom,4393997
,,,,
11532,Question-and-Answer,"We have looked at the data Chuck. Look the data is what exactly we would expect that that suburban homes are -- have high growth rates, second home markets have the highest growth rates. And then you have as Gary talked about an exodus out of cities.",Jack Preston,4393997
,,,,
11533,Question-and-Answer,So -- but again we are in all these markets and our customers whether they have a primary home in an urban market and happen to be moving out there. It?s all at the end f the day good for our business.,Jack Preston,4393997
,,,,
11534,Question-and-Answer,"We haven?t gone into much more detail. But I think the trends, like I said, that hierarchy of second home having strongest growth suburban very strong growth and urban being the weakest of the three. Again, it?s kind of a firm grasp of the obvious as we say sometimes. But I am not sure, Gary you got anything else there?",Jack Preston,4393997
,,,,
11535,Question-and-Answer,"No. No. I mean, look our business has always been our biggest part of our business is a suburban market business, right? It is where more large homes are, where those large homes have more bedrooms, more living space, outdoor furniture space, so on and so forth. And no surprise it?s the largest part of our business.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11536,Question-and-Answer,And so the suburban market which is significantly large part of our business is -- has tailwind and as people move into it. That?s good for us. But its? again -- it?s we know all the data we have got -- we look at it. I don?t know if any of it tells us to do anything differently or expect anything differently.,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11537,Question-and-Answer,"There?s not like markets we go, oh, My God, they are buying homes there and they don?t know about us or let?s rush to open a gallery or stuff like that. I mean, some place you go, okay, we have been looking in Palm Desert in Southern California for years and it?s on fire.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11538,Question-and-Answer,"And the staff who is our Chief Gallery Officer went to see his grandparents over Thanksgiving. And he said we really, really need a gallery there and I felt yeah, it?s on the list. You feel strongly about it, go find a location and we will get it then quickly. I mean -- but it?s not like -- it?s not like oh my God. That?s going to change so much. It?s just probably a little mark.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11539,Question-and-Answer,,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11540,Question-and-Answer,"But we are really well-positioned in North America to capitalize based on any way it shifts within the market. We just like that the market is up, right? We are well-positioned to capitalize. No matter where they are moving in North America. I think the only places like we were not represented in Montreal and we are not represented in Hawaii. I am trying to think. So there?s a couple of places like that.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11541,Question-and-Answer,Naples?,Jack Preston,4393997
,,,,
11542,Question-and-Answer,Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We -- yeah. We are not in Naples.,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11543,Question-and-Answer,Yeah.,Jack Preston,4393997
,,,,
11544,Question-and-Answer,"We plan to be in Naples, but we do great business in Naples even though we are not there.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11545,Question-and-Answer,Got it. Thanks very much.,Chuck Grom,4393997
,,,,
11546,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Lasser of UBS. Your line is open.,Operator,4393997
,,,,
11547,Question-and-Answer,"Good evening. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Gary, can you give us a flavor of the customer behavior that you are experiencing that drive this strong demand growth? How much is coming from new customers versus repeat customers and how much is coming from larger basket? Are you seeing a trend of customers who are more often buying furniture more than one room in their house and that where you are seeing a strong demand growth?",Michael Lasser,4393997
,,,,
11548,Question-and-Answer,"Our interior design business keeps growing and has been growing and so you?d thinking a big move like this. It?s kind of everything?s lifted here. If something shifted, we had outdoor was off the charts in the beginning because a lot of people I think realize you are not going to travel for the summer and spend a lot more time at home.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11549,Question-and-Answer,"But the consumer behavior is -- it hasn?t -- it?s no different than what you?d expect with demand like this. It?s a -- new customers to higher spend from existing customers, and so on and so forth. The metrics don?t make us think about doing anything meaningfully differently than what we are doing.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11550,Question-and-Answer,"So --yeah, yeah, so, we -- our business is -- has been growing if you think about size of basket and so on and so forth. It?s -- because we have moved the business from a -- from just conceptualizing selling product to or creating product and conceptualizing and selling spaces.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11551,Question-and-Answer,"And the efforts behind building an entire interior design platform on a national scale, if you go into our new galleries and you see the dedicated office space for our interior designers and the design affiliates and the meeting rooms and the space we have designed, it will tell you that that obviously is something we are investing into.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11552,Question-and-Answer,So -- and we think that?s going to be create strategic separation for a long time to come. All these investments we will continue to create strategic separation and render our brand more valuable long-term and so that?s what we feel best about.,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11553,Question-and-Answer,"Look at all these pieces and say, what will this look like over the next decade, which I tried to give people a view at and told you what?s sitting behind me. I am looking, yeah, no one?s changed the whiteboard, so same whiteboard. That?s how we think about the business.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11554,Question-and-Answer,"Like I have always said, when people ask -- have asked me in the past, can I buy your stock? And I always say, ask the same question and say, are you an investor? Are you a trader? If you are a trader and you are focused on short-term episodic swings in the stock market or quarter-to-quarter kind of things, like don?t buy our stock. It?s going to be a volatile stock, because we are building something people haven?t seen before. It?s going to be misunderstood. It?s going to get overvalued and undervalued and you are going to not sleep a lot at nights.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11555,Question-and-Answer,"But if you are an investor and you take a long-term view, I mean, it?s one of the best places to put capital. I said that 10 years ago and I said that five years ago. And if you look at our performance, we -- we are -- you?d say, hey, boy, I wish I just hung on to RH stock.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11556,Question-and-Answer,,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11557,Question-and-Answer,"If I look at -- you look at our biggest shareholder today is Fidelity and the team of Fidelity who?s been there the whole time has held their stock. They have held 15% of our stock. At one point, it went up to almost 30% because we bought back at the company and they had a restriction. They couldn?t hold that much, but they would have liked to.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11558,Question-and-Answer,"But that team has not sold their stock at all since the IPO. And I think they feel pretty good that they invested in a stock in the -- when we went public at $24 a share and we will continue to invest in that looks like a good investment, even though it?s went crazily up and down, right?",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11559,Question-and-Answer,"And one of the biggest shareholders in the company and like people asked me on days when the stock does really well, the stock does really bad. It?s like, look, I don?t think about that. If you think about this is a long-term investment. This is a great place to invest. And I think the character in the makeup of our shareholder base would tell you the same thing. So?",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11560,Question-and-Answer,Yes.,Michael Lasser,4393997
,,,,
11561,Question-and-Answer,Yeah.,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11562,Question-and-Answer,"My follow-up question are these periods of disruption are always an opportune time to learn how to operate differently, given the extremes on the cost side in the third quarter and recognizing that some of the SG&A decline was from mainly in the sourcebook. Is RH now able to operate its model less cost intensively with a lower amount of labor so we shouldn?t necessarily expect the same amount of labor expense moving forward and how would you think about reinvesting some of that back in the business?",Michael Lasser,4393997
,,,,
11563,Question-and-Answer,"Well, the --look, the models are going to continue to evolve, right? When -- look, if you just take a simple move in our model and say, hey, we went from a legacy gallery to design gallery. And that design gallery will essentially double the business, right, over in one year to three years.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11564,Question-and-Answer,"So we are not going to mail any more sourcebooks into that market. We generally don?t. We maybe do a little splash, because we are opening a new gallery so people are aware of it. But our ad cost at a -- at that level, right, the leverage is massively.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11565,Question-and-Answer,"And I think people sometimes miss that in a model like ours, right, because they see this big gallery and they go, oh, it must cost a lot of money. It?s much more expensive and they don?t think about the dynamics of what happens, because no one -- like no one?s ever taken a really productive kind of a legacy store like we have.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11566,Question-and-Answer,"And then been able to just change the footprint and basically double their business. I have never seen it before. Consistently, across the entire country, we can do that. And so, when you think about ad cost, that gives you big leverage.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11567,Question-and-Answer,"When you have a temporal situation like this with the pandemic and you make a decision to not mail a book, are there things we can learn there? Yeah, but it?s really -- it?s a little tricky, like, as we go to reinvest and mail the books, we mail as much as last year. We do e-mail more. Do we mail less? Do we -- what do we test? I mean, we are going to look at a lot of data. We are going to run the models. We are always looking for opportunities to be more efficient to optimize. You also don?t want to under invest in the business certain times.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11568,Question-and-Answer,"So -- but our model -- again, all the way through, you think about doubling your revenue at retail which is the biggest part of our business in a market and what that does to the cost structure at corporate? What that does to cost structure against all the other operating areas, our distribution centers and so on and so forth? You are going to have leverage.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11569,Question-and-Answer,"When you think about kind of climbing the luxury mountain as we are and taking quality up and desirability up and prices up, that?s going to give you leverage, right? And then you think about just kind of being consistently unsatisfied with whatever today?s performance is which is our culture you are always looking at how to do things better.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11570,Question-and-Answer,,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11571,Question-and-Answer,"And so we are going to have the cost structure and where we have got all kinds of initiatives going, all kinds of investments we are making that we think will have really good returns that will make the model more efficient, more profitable.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11572,Question-and-Answer,"So whether it?s labor savings, it?s not so much labor savings, it?s leverage on -- in the business and strategies that we are doing that are making the business just more profitable, right? So -- and we have a lot of things happening that we believe will do that and our history, right, over the last several years.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11573,Question-and-Answer,"I mean, I remember when we said we were going kind of be 10% operating margin, everybody was like, oh, you can?t be 10% operating margin. So like I just want to say and then we hit 11.4%, right?",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11574,Question-and-Answer,"And look, I remember reading reports on the company 11.4% no one is, like, it?s higher than whoever and it?s unsustainable, right? They only have half the revenues of this other company that their high was 10% or whatnot and 11.4% is unsustainable and then we hit 14.1% operating margin and it?s like everybody was like it?s unsustainable.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11575,Question-and-Answer,"Now we are going to be at 21% and 21% on call it 7% revenue growth, like really the way to stand back and think about the pandemic is like smoosh the year altogether. We are only going to have revenues up 7% and operating margins are going to be 21%.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11576,Question-and-Answer,"Does it really matter how those revenues came over the course of the year or does it matter that on 7% revenue growth they hit 21%. So I don?t know if we didn?t have a pandemic, would we have hit 20% or we would have hit 22%?",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11577,Question-and-Answer,It?s not like the pandemic from a revenue point of view has enabled our operating margin this year. It really hasn?t. If anything it?s deleveraged our operating margin this year. It made us less efficient when you look at how things are happening.,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11578,Question-and-Answer,"Like think about this. We are generating like roughly $80 million to a $100 million of future revenue. We spent all the money engaging like all the customers, helping all the customers, doing all the design work and we are getting no revenues this year, that $80 million to $100 million.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11579,Question-and-Answer,"Put that $80 million to $100 million in your model this year and what would the operating margin for RH be? Because there wouldn?t really be much more cost, right? Like most of the cost is already behind us. We would had shipping and stuff like that.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11580,Question-and-Answer,"But you look at the flow through on that, you go operating margins would be higher than 21%, right? Like that?s what I focus on. Wait a minute. I am 7% operating margin. They hit 21%, right? I mean, they were -- we thought they were high at 14% and we thought they were really high at 11%, yeah.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11581,Question-and-Answer,"And then it starts to help you think about like, oh, where are they going next? Like we -- when we said we had a clear line of sight at 2020, it just came sooner than you expected, right? We say we have a clear line of sight at 25%. We have a clear line of sight. We think it?s over the next several years, all depends what?s going to happen.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11582,Question-and-Answer,"If -- look, if we don?t go into a recession, if we go into a recession, we will stop right there. It will be reset. It will take a little longer. But if we don?t and if the economy continues to just perform, like if we just grow it 8% to 12% a year, we are going to do pretty good. If we accelerate, like we think next year it?s going to be double digits, right? So that?s 10% or over.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11583,Question-and-Answer,"And so we wouldn?t tell you double digits if we didn?t really think it looked pretty certain, even like not expecting the trends in the second half of next year, we think when we anniversary those numbers, it?s not going to look like this. But we can look ahead and say, here?s all the things we are doing that will create upside. Here?s what?s going to cycle forward. Here?s the pluses and minuses.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11584,Question-and-Answer,,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11585,Question-and-Answer,"I mean, if you just take the lost revenues in our New York restaurant and add those back, it?s not a little, like that was -- it?s a very high-volume restaurant. And once the vaccines get out to there, people are going to start going back to restaurants.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11586,Question-and-Answer,"By the way, if you think about all the traffic we lost in restaurants, you think we run the restaurants just for the restaurant business? Of course, not. All that traffic drives business in our galleries to our brand.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11587,Question-and-Answer,"And so when you go, oh, the restaurant business, I don?t know, the last few months were down like 70%, right, to our plan. When that comes back, there?s going to be a whole lot of people in RH Galleries, a whole lot of people discovering a lot of new products, a whole lot of people hopefully be inspired by our environment and there?s going to be kind of tailwinds here.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11588,Question-and-Answer,"But the real point is don?t get lost in the pandemic, right? Like, it?s a crazy year, right, down in the first quarter, stores closed. Stores closed part of the second quarter. Things all of a sudden swing back. I kind of watch it all way go. Revenues up 7%, looks like, okay, we are a little behind our 8% to 12% growth, but operating margins are going to be 21%. I really like this model. This is a really good model. I wouldn?t bet against this team.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11589,Question-and-Answer,We have done what we said we were going to do very consistently and we have exceeded people?s expectations massively over the last few years since we have transformed the entire company on so many levels and now we have got kind of a brand with no peer.,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11590,Question-and-Answer,And we have a DNA that?s just massively unsatisfied. We get super excited for like a few minutes and then we are really intense around here about like what?s next and making things great. So I just -- I like the path we are on.,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11591,Question-and-Answer,"And as a big shareholder here, I really like the next 10 years and I wouldn?t have told you that if it really wasn?t on the whiteboard behind me. My team?s all not even smiling, right? We look at this. We are big thinkers. We look at a long-term view. I know you have a lot of customers that are real short-term focused. That?s okay. Like, don?t buy our stock. Like, if they want it -- if they want to own one stock with a long-term view, it?s a good place.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11592,Question-and-Answer,That?s very helpful. Thank you very much and have a nice holiday.,Michael Lasser,4393997
,,,,
11593,Question-and-Answer,Thank you.,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11594,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris, excuse me, Curtis Nagle of Bank of America. Your line is open.",Operator,4393997
,,,,
11595,Question-and-Answer,"Hi. Good evening. Thanks very much. So, yeah, I want to turn I guess for the RH contemporary line. Maybe just get a little more detail in terms of the vision and strategy. Gary, you described it as bridging between the interior and modern lines in the ladder. I am guessing there?s -- I guess, what I?d say is, an extremely strong chance, you wouldn?t rule it out if you thought it would cannibalize existing business. So, yeah, I just kind of curious what gives the confidence you think that this is going to be a good incremental business about how it?s out of the other lines. Yeah, how should we think about it?",Curtis Nagle,4393997
,,,,
11596,Question-and-Answer,"I think about it is we are excited about it and you ought to be excited about it. Because we are not excited about things that we don?t want to buy and that we -- I mean we are -- we might be too excited about it, right? If anything last night late as selling area like, okay. So let?s make sure we are looking at the whole Board here, because it is really exciting. There?s a lot of really new product and so we just think it?s going to open the aperture of the brand.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11597,Question-and-Answer,"And yeah, we are really excited about how our teams can do everything at once and we keep kicking the can down the road at color. We got -- I think we are starting to zero in on RH color. It?s a tough one, right? We are a neutral space brand. We are kind of famous for our look in point of view. In fact, we are so famous for it, that people that like color kind of hate our brand almost like it offends them that there?s not a lot of color in our age.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11598,Question-and-Answer,,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11599,Question-and-Answer,"But that?s okay. We tell people that, look, there?s not a lot of color in humans, right? We are also some form of a neutral color from light to dark, right? And that?s why neutrals is the biggest part of the market, because most great design is a reflection of human design. That?s why it?s familiar and comfortable with it and that?s why you go, ah, because it?s a reflection of self.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11600,Question-and-Answer,But we do think that there?s a market for color. It?s not the biggest part of the market. But that will open up the aperture that we are in. So just no different than beach house and ski house opened up our brand.,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11601,Question-and-Answer,"People talk like relatively small introductions, writing small books, but a big conversation. I can?t tell you how many people have said, oh, I have got your ski house book. It can?t wait. We are doing it. We got your test book and so forth, so a lot of these things too.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11602,Question-and-Answer,"Again, we say internally if you want to be part of the conversation you have to create the conversation, right? And contemporary is going to create another conversation. Color is going to create another conversation. You just have to do these things really, really well.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11603,Question-and-Answer,"But you should be really excited about it because we are really excited about it. And it?s -- what exactly does it look like, I mean, I can?t say that. It?s their remarks. It?s going to look very new and fresh. But again, we like to say the things that really do well are fresh yet familiar, right?",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11604,Question-and-Answer,So you can?t do things that are too far out there. Those are interesting but generally not relevant to your business and don?t sell well. But we think it looks very fresh. There?s a familiarity to it and there?s kind of really great historic design references that make it familiar. So when we get things that are fresh and familiar they are usually really good.,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11605,Question-and-Answer,"Go it. Excited to see it when you release it. Just as a quick follow up. Going back to Europe, I don?t know in theory. Do you think that the -- I know there are a lot of moving pieces here and its super early. But do you think that perhaps the profit contribution could be higher than the U.S. at some point in time, when do you get a little bit scale, given the comments you made about perhaps having a less dense category strategy [ph] and the additional international exposure you guys are probably going to see from being in these major capital cities?",Curtis Nagle,4393997
,,,,
11606,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. All our research and due diligence would say the potential is for higher margins than the U.S. And a lot of brands as you know have higher margins and higher profitability outside the U.S. than they do inside the U.S. And that?s because you are getting a lot of leverage off your cost structure, right, if you set it up well if you are not overly redundant.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11607,Question-and-Answer,"And for us, right, we don?t have to set up any kind of redundant buying organizations or inventory organizations or things like that. I mean think about it. We don?t have any cash and carry, what is our cash and carry business these days?",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11608,Question-and-Answer,Less than a 1%.,Jack Preston,4393997
,,,,
11609,Question-and-Answer,"I?d say, 1%.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11610,Question-and-Answer,Yeah. You are right.,Jack Preston,4393997
,,,,
11611,Question-and-Answer,It?s almost zero?,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11612,Question-and-Answer,It?s a zero?,Jack Preston,4393997
,,,,
11613,Question-and-Answer,"Almost, right, like?",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11614,Question-and-Answer,Yeah.,Jack Preston,4393997
,,,,
11615,Question-and-Answer,"We don?t really sell anything. It used to be like a percent or 2% and now it?s almost zero. We just -- yeah, we have gotten rid of the holiday stuff. We got rid of the ornaments and everything. So, yeah, every once in a while, someone buys some towels or something like it and walks out with them. For the most part, we don?t really inventory anything in our stores.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11616,Question-and-Answer,"So our model has -- is very simplistic versus other models, like, someone?s saying to me, like, oh, well, Home Depot or Target or other people didn?t do so well over in Europe or other -- yeah. Well, one, those are kind stores, not brands, right? They are stores selling other people?s brands.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11617,Question-and-Answer,,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11618,Question-and-Answer,"Most high-end luxury brands work really well globally, right? And if you are the best in your kind of category and we believe we are, then those brands do -- they usually do exponentially better than others.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11619,Question-and-Answer,"And so -- and then -- and it seemed very strategic, I actually liked that we gave ourselves a little bit more time on Europe, because we had more time to think about things like this Curtis, the margin structure, how we think about it, the pricing.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11620,Question-and-Answer,"All the different nuances and really, really think deeply about these moves that we are going to make in positioning the business correctly, because everything we have looked at and read and looked at points of references would say, we should have higher profit margins in Europe.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11621,Question-and-Answer,"Now there?s going to be some short-term, some expense yet minor expense deleverage as you ramp up the infrastructure. But that might take care of itself relatively quickly because of the broad based market you are going to address by opening and just -- by opening it just in the U.K., in London and England and Paris, and a couple of these galleries, even looking at Munich and Dusseldorf or Madrid and Brussels and once just with that little footprint.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11622,Question-and-Answer,"You are going to get a massive audience, right, because of the Internet and because the online component of the business. And by positioning ourselves in these kind of extraordinary locations and stores and environments that we are looking at, it?s going to be a great new learning. I mean, I really -- as much I really didn?t want to delay it, it was just the right business decision to do it, because we are so anxious to learn.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11623,Question-and-Answer,"But I think what you are saying is directionally right. I think it should be based on other points of reference more profitable or at least as profitable as our U.S. business. But it should create leverage, right? So the net-net effect should be overall RH margins going up.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11624,Question-and-Answer,Got it. Thanks very much for the thought and happy holidays.,Curtis Nagle,4393997
,,,,
11625,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. Happy holidays to you.,Gary Friedman,4393997

11626,Question-and-Answer,Operator?,Jack Preston,4393997

11627,Question-and-Answer,Ally?,Allison Malkin,4393997
,,,,
11628,Question-and-Answer,Operator?,Jack Preston,4393997
,,,,
11629,Question-and-Answer,We have got our last question or is the operator?,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11630,Question-and-Answer,We saw three?,Jack Preston,4393997
,,,,
11631,Question-and-Answer,No. There?,Allison Malkin,4393997
,,,,
11632,Question-and-Answer,Three more.,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11633,Question-and-Answer,There?s two more.,Allison Malkin,4393997
,,,,
11634,Question-and-Answer,Two more? Okay.,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11635,Question-and-Answer,Two more.,Jack Preston,4393997
,,,,
11636,Question-and-Answer,We lost our operator?,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11637,Question-and-Answer,"Brad Thomas, your line is open.",Operator,4393997
,,,,
11638,Question-and-Answer,"Hi, Gary and Jack. Can you hear me?",Brad Thomas,4393997
,,,,
11639,Question-and-Answer,We can hear you.,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11640,Question-and-Answer,"Hi, Brad.",Jack Preston,4393997
,,,,
11641,Question-and-Answer,"Great. Hey. It?s Brad Thomas with KeyBanc. Thanks for making time for my question here. Just hopefully a quick one just on how to think about 4Q? I know there?s not specific guidance. But if you go back the last four years the fourth quarter has been your highest order for operating margin of any quarter and so just trying to understand some of the seasonal dynamics. Gary, I think you also reference that if sales for the full year come in growing about 7% that that might get you to 21% operating margin, which maybe pushes that 4Q operating margin closer to 20%. Just trying to understand if there?s any puts or takes that we should be aware of to make this 4Q different than what we have seen the last few years seasonally?",Brad Thomas,4393997
,,,,
11642,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. Well, I mean, Jack can give you some highlights.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11643,Question-and-Answer,Yeah.,Jack Preston,4393997
,,,,
11644,Question-and-Answer,"But one of the big ones is, Q3 has helped by not mailing a book. Hard to say exactly how much because we would have got more revenue. We expect revenues to slow a bit based on the fact that we don?t have the books and so you don?t have the ramp of the books and we are at record kind of out of stocks and things like that. So we are taking a conservative view and I think in the fourth quarter as we should.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11645,Question-and-Answer,"But -- I think the landscaping is a little hard to look at historically, because there has been so much change, change in demand trends, change in margins, you have things cycling through like when -- when the outlet business, how the outlet business cycles in and out and how the rug business cycles quarter-to-quarter, puts and takes that may have distorted past orders in past times.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11646,Question-and-Answer,,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11647,Question-and-Answer,"So -- and then we have things like -- we generally have a much bigger bonus accrual in Q4 and other things like that where we are having really good years and that can distort things. So, yeah, I don?t Jack if you want to?",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11648,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. One thing I will add, as you think about the 21% in 2020 and as we talked about that as sort of floor number, that 7% growth rate. So that it does imply about 20% growth for revenue, as Gary mentioned, that is a slight deceleration from the 25 points in Q3.",Jack Preston,4393997
,,,,
11649,Question-and-Answer,"And then margin wise, to get the year at to ?21, obviously that implies just shy of ?21 for Q4, and I think, Gary spoke to that. You can?t look at the same sequential trends because Q3 has the advertising benefit.",Jack Preston,4393997
,,,,
11650,Question-and-Answer,"And so, I was going to make similar comments on the cycling, right? So like the rug business, we had talked about it as a sort of -- when you think about when we started clearing that out and put the new product on.",Jack Preston,4393997
,,,,
11651,Question-and-Answer,The biggest benefits are going to be through this quarter. We will still get some benefit in Q4 and then once you come into next year. That will be fully cycled. And our outlet will have a different dynamic. But directionally I think those are some of the pieces.,Jack Preston,4393997
,,,,
11652,Question-and-Answer,"That?s really helpful color. Thank you. If I could squeeze in one more housekeeping just around the merchandising newness for next year, any more color on maybe the magnitude. What percentage of products you may refresh or maybe new in 2021 and how that compares to what you normally change out or would like to normally change out?",Brad Thomas,4393997
,,,,
11653,Question-and-Answer,I will just say year-over-year it will be a -- it will be a meaningful increase year-over-year.,Jack Preston,4393997
,,,,
11654,Question-and-Answer,Thank you so much. Hope you all have a great holiday.,Brad Thomas,4393997
,,,,
11655,Question-and-Answer,"Great. Thank you, Brad.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11656,Question-and-Answer,"Thanks, Brad.",Jack Preston,4393997
,,,,
11657,Question-and-Answer,Happy holidays to you.,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11658,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. Our next question comes from Tami Zakaria of JPMorgan. Your line is open.,Operator,4393997
,,,,
11659,Question-and-Answer,"Hi. Thank you so much for taking my question. I just have one longer term question. I think in your press release you spoke of 10% to 15% annual sales growth potential in the future with mid-20s operating margins. So what?s really driving that optimism of 10% to 15% versus 8% to 12% that you have been speaking out prior to this trend? Do you need all the new businesses to come to life, like, the Yard and RH Residences business to come to life to get there or can you get to that 10% to 15% with the existing home furnishings business alone?",Tami Zakaria,4393997
,,,,
11660,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. First, let me kind of characterize that, what -- I gave you kind of our internal view of what?s possible, right? Not necessarily our guidance and we are obviously going to always have a view internally of what can happen.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11661,Question-and-Answer,"I?d start with you, if you just kind of thought about -- if you take the belief that, hey, RH is building one of the dominant -- one of the kind of premier luxury brands in its space in the world and if it performs like other luxury brands and you think about the -- just the market at a global level, it would imply that 25% of our business should be kind of in the U.S./North America and 75% of our business should be outside of the U.S.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11662,Question-and-Answer,"And we believe we can be $5 billion to $6 billion long term in North America. That would imply that we would be a $20 billion to $24 billion global brand as architected today. The yacht is a brand elevating conversation, right?",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11663,Question-and-Answer,"There?s -- some people that are spending money like everybody else on digital marketing, doing things that nobody talks about. We mentioned a yacht and a lot of people are talking about it, right?",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11664,Question-and-Answer,"And when you see it on our website in the world of RH where 30-odd million people will see it every year, it?s going to be a pretty cool thing and a pretty big conversation for a pretty minor investment, right?",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11665,Question-and-Answer,,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11666,Question-and-Answer,"And so it?s not it?s not about how many people are going to be on the yacht. It?s about how many people are going to appreciate the design, the creativity, the taste and style of the yacht and how many people are going to be aware of it and talk about that yacht, right?",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11667,Question-and-Answer,"And so, yeah, the yacht is not a big growth story, the yacht conversation, right? The ads probably say we do want to be part of the conversation. You got to create the conversation. You want to climb the luxury mountain and you want people at the highest end of -- at this top of the mountain to talk about you, do things that they are interested in.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11668,Question-and-Answer,"Do -- be places where they spend their time. If you are in something in hospitality whether it?s a yacht or a guest house, do something that forces the very highest people at taste level of wealth influence force them to tip their hat that you did such great work that you earn their respect that think you create a forced reconsideration of your brand, right? So -- but the growth like if you just said, hey, we are going to get to the number is like $7.4 billion to $11.5 billion?",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11669,Question-and-Answer,$11.5 billion. Yeah. $7.4 billion to $11.5 billion,Jack Preston,4393997
,,,,
11670,Question-and-Answer,"$7.4 billion to $11.5 billion is like maybe half way to our global potential. So it?s -- for us to have a goal of saying, hey, can we grow this thing at 10% to 15%? We could. We could maybe grow faster. It depends on how much risk. It depends on how quickly you can go without putting risk into the work, right?",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11671,Question-and-Answer,"I mean we are -- furniture of this quality has never been made in these quantities. So we have to build this supply chain and the platform to be able to do this, right? But -- I mean the thing that gives me confidence about that is it from where -- we have been to where we -- to where we are. We have learned that supply chases demand. If you create demand, people will figure out how to supply that demand, because there?s opportunities for people to benefit economically, right?",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11672,Question-and-Answer,And so we believe we will create a market at the higher end. We think that market is a potential for probably $20 billion to $25 billion globally and 10% to 15% annual sales growth could be possible.,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11673,Question-and-Answer,"I wouldn?t plug it into your models. But if you wanted to look at an upside model of what might potentially could be if we start opening countries and opening countries is exponentially more valuable opening stores in North America that could accelerate our growth rate, right?",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11674,Question-and-Answer,"We have people knocking down the door here, trying to partner with us with our brand, wanting to partner with us in China, partner with us in the Middle East, partner with us in Europe, partner with us in South America, partner with us in Mexico. Like, there is not -- I don?t think there?s a country unrepresented as far as people like knocking on our door wanting to take our brand globally.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11675,Question-and-Answer,"We could go faster. It might mean less control and we believe brands with more control will become more valuable. If you look at history and you look at all the great brands, they are all buying back their business from partners, because they believe they can run the business better and there?s greater returns.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11676,Question-and-Answer,"So we are going to learn from that history. We are going to probably go slower and with more control. And we are going to try to retain as much control of our brand as we possibly can. I mean, today, we have 100% control of our brand.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11677,Question-and-Answer,"Nobody presents our products but us. Nobody sells our products but us. Nobody uses our brand or our marks but us. And we think that?s going to be more and more important in a world of marketplaces and kind of what it called message, right, like this.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11678,Question-and-Answer,"I think any of these brands -- I mean, you look to the right model, look at what Macy?s [ph] is doing, look at what Chanel?s doing, look at what the LVMH brands are doing, look at the people that didn?t put their brands out in marketplaces that were very discerning about what they have done that the investments that they have made.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11679,Question-and-Answer,,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11680,Question-and-Answer,"They have taken -- you look at the great brands, they have taken more and more control of their distribution. You look at the brands that didn?t make those investments and what happened to them and I don?t have to name them but you know who they are. I mean they are -- the value has been significantly diminished, because there?s brands that had too much of their distribution was controlled by department stores.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11681,Question-and-Answer,"Department store is a decaying platform. Imagine if you were -- you built a great brand and your distribution platform was predominantly department stores and you don?t have control of your distribution channel. I mean, I think what [inaudible] and Channel teams and other people who have invested over the past 10 years to 15 years to take control of their distribution that?s why there?s a brands they are today.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11682,Question-and-Answer,"Good news is we are not in any department stores. We are not in any -- nobody?s got any control this brand but us and so we love that positioning and we think it may mean we go slower with higher quality and that?s okay, that?s okay.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11683,Question-and-Answer,"We are -- the world is only going to get smaller. It?s not going to get bigger, right? The Internet and communications and technology is bringing the world together. English is going to become the language and it?s so much different and every decade it?s exponentially easier to operate internationally. So and that just is going to grow faster.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11684,Question-and-Answer,"So -- and I just think that, if you were, I would say, 10% to 15%, it?s -- probably people on the long side of this business that have that model probably. Should it be a secret that choose the RH team thinks that they might be able to grow this to 10% to 15%. We think we can probably do that. Is that what we are going to guide you? No. Not until we are more confident.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11685,Question-and-Answer,"There may be a time we are sitting here and that becomes the guidance. There may be a point that we are sitting here in a few years after we have got more data and proof-of-concept globally, that the number could be 15% to 20%. I don?t know.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11686,Question-and-Answer,"It?s not unreasonable if you think that the size of the market for logistic core business. Everything else is gravy. So I think we are -- the yacht business is going to be meaningful from a taste and style and image in conversation point of view, yes. For revenue point of view, no.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11687,Question-and-Answer,"We will do revenues, but I think we have got, like, we have multiple charters lined up. It?s like we -- and we unfortunately had to cancel seven charters on the boat this past summer because of the pandemic. But there?s a lot of demand for a boat. But that?s irrelevant from a revenue point of view.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11688,Question-and-Answer,Do I think things like guest houses could be meaningful long-term. They might be. I think the work is that good. I think what it?s evolved into is something extraordinary beyond what my initial vision or expectation support were.,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11689,Question-and-Answer,And I think it?s become that because we control everything. Not some third-party. It?s not Marriott using our brand. You have a bunch of bureaucrats with no taste kind of screwing up your brand. It?s not some other little hotel company that?s just doing a revenue share thing with you. We have total control of this thing.,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11690,Question-and-Answer,"Do I think RH Residencies could be a big idea? I really do. I am fascinated with it. I am fascinated with selling spaces, because when I go on Zillow and I go on Redfin and I look at the level of taste, the design, I see crappy architecture,. I see non-existent interior design and I am like, man, people with a lot of money don?t have the ability or access to make their home look, amazing.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11691,Question-and-Answer,"Like, why doesn?t everybody have an incredible inspiring home, especially if you can afford it? Why? Because it?s really hard to do and there?s no way to do it. And by the way, why wouldn?t you buy homes that are fully furnished, that are perfect. That you just like you buy and just give me the key and you move in, enough to spend a year or two years or three years or four years or five years or never get your home. Most people just never finish it.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11692,Question-and-Answer,,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11693,Question-and-Answer,"Like so -- like Eri said to me a long time ago, like, hey, they don?t sell you are a car without an interior. You don?t sit there and trying to figure out the interior of your car. Yeah, you get to pick your color. You want tanned. You want black.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11694,Question-and-Answer,"You want -- so I just think I am fascinated with the fact that there?s so little great architecture, such little great design. I mean start in any market you want. Like you want to go to marine right now, I think the most expensive house is $43 million.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11695,Question-and-Answer,"Just click down and tell me what you think of the architecture, the landscape architecture, the interior design, the furnishings, the taste, the style. It could be massive. It could be massive. You said like, hey, was there an acquisition we make some day? I don?t know. Maybe we buy one of the big home builders and we infuse them with great taste and I am not saying we are going to do that.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11696,Question-and-Answer,"But if you want to think big, I mean, there?s -- like I think we can create an entirely new market for residences whether they are condominiums or homes or single homes and communities and things like that, and you will hear more about this.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11697,Question-and-Answer,"We are pursuing opportunities in spaces and place is part of our strategy. And you will hear about our first tests of Orange residences and --but whether it?s home, condominiums, whether it?s luxury rentals huge opportunity. The market?s full of crap out there like it?s massive opportunity.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11698,Question-and-Answer,"Got it. Got it. That?s very helpful as always. Thanks, Gary.",Tami Zakaria,4393997
,,,,
11699,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. Happy holidays.,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11700,Question-and-Answer,You too.,Tami Zakaria,4393997
,,,,
11701,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. Our final question comes from the Seth Basham of Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.,Operator,4393997
,,,,
11702,Question-and-Answer,"Hi. Good evening, Seth Basham here. Thanks for taking my question. The first question is just around understanding product margin in the quarter. Now product margin expansion certainly drove the majority to gross margin expansion. But could you help us understand how much of the revenue mix shift away from hospitality and outlet helped increase gross margins in the third quarter?",Seth Basham,4393997
,,,,
11703,Question-and-Answer,"From a product margin point of view our hospitality margin is like quite good. You obviously have a higher mix of employment. But we are also operating the restaurants at very low levels of productivity and we are keeping people employed, right? So we actually got a pretty big drag from the restaurant?",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11704,Question-and-Answer,Overall to the business.,Jack Preston,4393997
,,,,
11705,Question-and-Answer,Overall?,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11706,Question-and-Answer,Slight -- a slight lift in the margin to -- very slight.,Jack Preston,4393997
,,,,
11707,Question-and-Answer,Very slight.,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11708,Question-and-Answer,In the sales margin?,Jack Preston,4393997
,,,,
11709,Question-and-Answer,There?s not enough sales.,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11710,Question-and-Answer,Yeah. There?s not enough sales to make a?,Jack Preston,4393997
,,,,
11711,Question-and-Answer,Yeah. Yeah.,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11712,Question-and-Answer,? big impact.,Jack Preston,4393997
,,,,
11713,Question-and-Answer,Yeah. Yeah. So?,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11714,Question-and-Answer,Yeah. But?,Jack Preston,4393997
,,,,
11715,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. And then the outlet, yeah, we have kind of given you directionally that?s year-over-year that?s been a big driver because we redesigned and re-conceptualized the whole reverse logistics business.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11716,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. Yes. So, of that 530 basis points of product margin, essentially half are in our core business, with some of that still related to the rug cycling as we talked about. And then half is from outlet. And that -- those are the big pieces of the factors.",Jack Preston,4393997
,,,,
11717,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. But inside the core business I think every category has got positive product margins, right?",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11718,Question-and-Answer,That?s correct.,Jack Preston,4393997
,,,,
11719,Question-and-Answer,Yeah.,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11720,Question-and-Answer,Very helpful. Thanks. And then?,Seth Basham,4393997
,,,,
11721,Question-and-Answer,Yeah.,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11722,Question-and-Answer,?one item that -- one area that we haven?t really discussed much on this call is the interior design architecture and landscape architecture opportunity. Could you just give us an update on your rollout plan associated with that business?,Seth Basham,4393997
,,,,
11723,Question-and-Answer,"Well, interior design is out there, right. It?s a -- I think today we must be the biggest residential interior design firm in North America, if you look at the work that we do and the projects that we do.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11724,Question-and-Answer,,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11725,Question-and-Answer,"And architecture -- and landscape architecture, we will begin to test that. I gave you a bigger vision for that, how it?s going to be within the world of our age. But we were going to move more quickly. We have pushed some of the plans out a bit because of the pandemic.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11726,Question-and-Answer,"But we are looking at testing our first kind of freestanding architecture interior design, the landscape, architecture, studio in a design district that will support many of our galleries in a market.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11727,Question-and-Answer,So we will -- the way to think about it is where you see today if you have been into one of our new galleries. One of our prototypes where kind of the back part through -- if you look through the staircase is big glass wall with desks and it?s right next to our design affiliate.,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11728,Question-and-Answer,"We are all -- our interior designers have their offices and that says right now RH interior design. Long-term, we believe it will say, long -- RH architecture, interior design and landscape architecture.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11729,Question-and-Answer,"And I think about that the galleries because they are a manifestation of great architecture, great interior design and great landscape architecture. We will have the only consumer-facing business of its kind like that.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11730,Question-and-Answer,"Most architects don?t have an office that anybody sees and most architects? offices aren?t in great architecture necessarily. Landscape architects, like where do you find one, like, interior designers, again, not a consumer-facing business.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11731,Question-and-Answer,"So inside these big magnificent galleries that are an example of all those disciplines, it only makes sense that people would go, oh. I can?t tell you how many times people are in our galleries that ask us who the architect is. How many people ask us out, who did the landscape architecture? Who did the landscaping here? They obviously know we did the interior design.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11732,Question-and-Answer,"So we think there?s an opportunity to continue to elevate and amplify the core business by expanding our services business, which is a very capital-light business if you think about it, right? It?s not a lot of capital to make the investment to act -- add those services and those services don?t face the consumer in a very compelling way.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11733,Question-and-Answer,"So -- and there are things that we already do really well, right? We now do almost all of our architecture internally, right, very little externally. We have a great internal architecture team. We do all of our landscape architecture internally. We do all of our interior design internally. And so their competencies of our company and it?s just building out the teams kind of market-by-market, right?",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11734,Question-and-Answer,"And just as we did with interior design, I see it no differently than interior design. It will take us several years to kind of do it and we will learn and we will roll it out. But we have set up kind of the galleries, the new galleries to accept those businesses.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11735,Question-and-Answer,"Now we may need support offices behind the scenes. We will interface with the customer there. We will catch them there. We will consult with them. We will make the initial connection. But we probably will need some office space to support those businesses but that office space can be anywhere, right?",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11736,Question-and-Answer,"It?s not high cost real estate. You are not paying premium retail real estate for the back-of-house office. We do all of our meetings in the galleries, but we might have to house more team members doing the production work on the architecture or the landscape architecture and things like that. So we think it?s very logical for us to pursue the services side of the business and we think we are really well-positioned to capitalize on it and we have the competence, right? It is what we do.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11737,Question-and-Answer,"That?s helpful. Just to clarify Gary, I know you don?t charge for the in your design services now unless I am mistaken. But do you plan to charge for those in the future and I presume that you plan to charge for the architecture and landscape architecture design services?",Seth Basham,4393997
,,,,
11738,Question-and-Answer,,Seth Basham,4393997
,,,,
11739,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. Yeah. For sure the architecture and landscape architecture design services, how we think about the interior design piece work, we are still noodling with that. We believe at some point, we will probably charge to that. But we may not need to. I am not, I am not sure honestly.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11740,Question-and-Answer,"I mean I go back and forth on that one all the time, like, so more to come, but we will develop there more. But I think as we test this and kind of get our arms around it and we are going to -- we will probably start it here locally.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11741,Question-and-Answer,"I guess, I could say, we are thinking of doing right. Yeah, I mean, we could -- I reserve the right to change our mind, I think, I am assuming. But we -- our plans for opening a beautiful new gallery in San Francisco at the historic Bethlehem Steel Building, it?s really spectacular when everybody can travel again and come up to San Francisco. Let us know we will get you a seat at the restaurant spectacular restaurant.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11742,Question-and-Answer,"It will be the first restaurant with our -- we are actually testing our new guesthouse concept and menu there. It will be kind of a dual restaurant. We will have a live fire cooking component to it. That?s really great. But we are in this spectacular gallery in San Francisco, rooftop park, views of the bay and the city and so on and so forth.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11743,Question-and-Answer,"And we have this is -- as you know if you have been in San Francisco, we -- one of the great learnings for us is when we took this amazing little building in the heart of The Design District that was the Ed Hardy Antique Gallery and he built this charming palladium building. And we went into this center of the design district and said we got to put our brand among the very best.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11744,Question-and-Answer,"Remember the headline in the local San Francisco paper was There Goes the Neighborhood Change Store Going into the Design District, right? So we did pretty good work. We opened a beautiful gallery there. I think we see the people?s expectations and it became really fantastic for bid we -- that gallery is like $20 million.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11745,Question-and-Answer,Correct.,Jack Preston,4393997
,,,,
11746,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. Something like that. In 4,500 square feet.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11747,Question-and-Answer,Right.,Jack Preston,4393997
,,,,
11748,Question-and-Answer,"Incredibly, it was one of our best real estate moves ever. We bought a little building I think for $3.5 million. But we have this charming building with a beautiful garden courtyard and we have learned so much being in that building and we could sell the building for $10 million or something.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11749,Question-and-Answer,"And we are thinking -- we are right in the center the design district. Why don?t we take that building and turn it into the first kind of freestanding RH architecture interior design and landscape architecture studio, right?",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11750,Question-and-Answer,"And right in the heart of the design district, face the customer there in the heart of the design district and then face the customer in our galleries and use this as our first ecosystem for the services platform right here in our backyard. We can go there. We can listen and learn, very visible, use it as a lab and we think that will really accelerate our learnings. So that?s what we will do with it.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11751,Question-and-Answer,Exactly when we start? Not sure yet. We have got a lot of big rock for moving in different parts of the business right now. And just want to make sure we do this one well. And we have a team in place that can really positioned this well and make a great first impression as we entered the services business.,Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11752,Question-and-Answer,"But that?s what you can expect from us. I think we will -- now that I have said it, what I like is that we are committed to it, right? It kind of -- we have been talking about it but now, we are committed. So it will happen. But if it works, I think, it just opens up another aperture business for us, right?",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11753,Question-and-Answer,"If all of a sudden we become the architect for people?s homes, you are just going to sell them a lot more furniture and lighting and accessories and blubs [ph] and bath hardware and all the things we sell.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11754,Question-and-Answer,,Gary Friedman,4393997

11758,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. I am showing no further questions. I?d like to turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks.,Operator,4393997
,,,,
11759,Question-and-Answer,"Great. Well, thank you, everyone. I want to especially thank our people and our partners around the world who have worked so hard through these challenging times to continue to elevate our brand and bring our vision to life each and every day.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11760,Question-and-Answer,"And also our thoughts and prayers go out to everyone who?s suffering through this pandemic, especially of people who have been infected by this virus and have family members and loved ones impacted. And thanks to all the people on the frontlines that are just working to keep us safe and get us through this.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11761,Question-and-Answer,"And this is -- it?s been a -- just a very mixed feelings, right, from our company, you -- again, when there?s so many people suffering and your business is doing well and you are getting the tailwind, it?s hard to really feel that good when other people are having the opposite experience. So we just hope that we get through this very soon, that the world will continue to evolve and improve and we will be here for the long-term.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11762,Question-and-Answer,"But we want to thank everyone for their hard work, their leadership, their imagination and their perspiration in bringing this to life. And all our frontline teams that is in our galleries, it?s in our call centers, it?s in our distribution centers and delivering our products into our customer?s homes.",Gary Friedman,4393997
,,,,
11763,Question-and-Answer,"They have had to walk a fine line, right, and being on the frontlines, and especially want to thank those teams who have represented our company and our brand so well through these challenging times. So we wish everyone a wonderful holiday and a safe holiday and here?s to getting to the other side of this and back to bright and sunny days for everyone on this planet. Thank you.",Gary Friedman,4393997

,,,,
11771,Presentation,"Thank you, Jeremy. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on our quarterly update call today. We issued our first fiscal year 2021 financial and operating results after the close of the market today, and I hope you?ve had a chance to look at them. As we continue to drive forward in the pursuit of some normalcy in our daily lives, we at Enzo are extremely proud to have been part of the healthcare response to the COVID-19 pandemic.",Barry Weiner,4393966
,,,,
11772,Presentation,"Despite the continuing challenges that were presented to our business by COVID-19, we delivered an extremely robust first quarter for 2021. The results were across multiple metrics of success. Both our revenue and accessions volume increased significantly over the prior quarter, reaching pre-pandemic levels and exceeding our initial estimates by $1.7 million, which we provided earlier. Total revenue was $28.7 million a 47% increase over the preceding fourth quarter of 2020. Demonstrating continued evidence of recovery and the subsequent positive impact from COVID-19 on our business operations. We also saw continued margin improvement, leading to positive EBITDA of more than $1 million and positive earnings of approximately $0.01 per share.",Barry Weiner,4393966
,,,,
11773,Presentation,,Barry Weiner,4393966
,,,,
11774,Presentation,"Before elaborating further on the quarter, obviously we hope everyone has remained safe and healthy during the difficult and frustrating times. The health and safety of our employees has always been of extreme importance, and we greatly appreciate their contributions to keep our business running safely. We have been very fortunate that the implemented measures to safeguard our employees have been successful, while allowing us to maintain full operations, so that we may continue to advance the important work we've been providing to our healthcare community.",Barry Weiner,4393966
,,,,
11775,Presentation,"Even with the unprecedented challenges we faced this year, we were able to maintain our commitment to our core objectives; first, transforming into an integrated end to end diagnostic products and solutions company; second, building and investing in the infrastructure for growth; third, implementing efficiency measures to better bring in line or cost structure with the market needs; and fourth, building out our four key platforms and technologies to address enhanced value in the diagnostic sector. These objectives have helped us to further solidify Enzo's position as a comprehensive solutions provider in diagnostic products and services.",Barry Weiner,4393966
,,,,
11776,Presentation,"Despite the unprecedented conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have mobilized our operational resources to address the expanding needs of the market by servicing opportunities in new areas, including point of care and direct to consumer offerings. While most companies and businesses during this period have remained partially closed if not fully closed, Enzo employees have not only manned the front lines but expanded our operational capacity to continuously support the testing needs of the market.",Barry Weiner,4393966
,,,,
11777,Presentation,"We are extremely proud to welcome Dr. Mary Tagliaferri and Dr. Ian Walters, two highly respected and experienced industry professionals to our board of directors, which now number four independent directors among the five on our board. As executive clinical fellow and former Chief Medical Officer of Nektar, Dr. Tagliaferri brings deep business development, clinical research and development and global regulatory affairs skills to our board. Dr. Walters is CEO of Portage Biotech, and he has held executive positions at Bristol Myers Squibb and Millennium Pharmaceuticals. He's responsible for the development of more than 30 drugs, which lead to five new oncology drug approvals. In addition to his business acumen, he will be instrumental in identifying new ways that Enzo can effectively support companion diagnostics, early drug discovery and liquid biopsy techniques.",Barry Weiner,4393966
,,,,
11778,Presentation,"The addition of these two new directors significantly expands the operational and commercial expertise of our company's board, particularly concerning companion diagnostics and therapeutic opportunities. During the quarter, we worked with our partners to provide COVID-19 testing services focused on our geographical region. This includes multiple universities, such as Stony Brook University, Farmingdale State University, as well as urgent care facilities, nursing homes and corporations. These were implemented to our schools and institutional testing, we call it our SIT programs, which we launched in June. We are working with local government entities, helping them through this pandemic crisis as well. We are focusing on building out these new relationships beyond COVID testing and transitioning them into long term opportunities, utilizing Enzo's full menu of products and services.",Barry Weiner,4393966
,,,,
11779,Presentation,"Our recent gotestmenow online portal is our first direct to consumer offering that brings quick convenient COVID testing to individuals overseeing by licensed physicians. Currently, we have now over 30 convenient locations in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. It works as follows. A patient purchases the COVID-19 molecular or serological tests directly from the gotestmenow Web site and then goes to an Enzo clinical labs? patient service center or pop up site for specimen collection. The results are delivered directly to the individual through our online portal. We plan to extend this online offering to sexually transmitted diseases and other types of testing. Furthermore, we are working on launching a home kit to enable self-testing for certain diseases. We also recently announced the commercial launch of a small portable microplate reader for use with the company's immunoassay products. This affordable device enables Enzo to offer a complete solution to academic, CRO and other industrial customers. It is a compact plate reader that features an open design for quick plate loading and a USB connection. The personal 96 well format micro reader plate and machine can be used for a variety of applications, including a license, protein quantification assays, cell based assays and more. Ultimately, we hope it will provide new opportunities in points of care medicine.",Barry Weiner,4393966

,,,,
11781,Presentation,"On the research front, in a recently published book, titled In Situ Molecular Pathology and Co-Expression Analyses, Enzo loop RNA technology was expanded upon as a highly sensitive approach in the development of human papilloma virus probes. Enzo's loop RNA was compared against the market leader and demonstrated higher sensitivity. We believe this technology maybe extended beyond HPV for improved sensitivity with regards to other diagnostic testing. We also have several innovations and product launches, including serological testing in a post vaccine environment that are in early days of adoption but we think will be a critical element of diagnostic testing in 2021. And we look forward to updating our investors on these initiatives as they come forward.",Barry Weiner,4393966
,,,,
11782,Presentation,"I'd like to turn the call over to David, who will provide a financial update.",Barry Weiner,4393966
,,,,
11783,Presentation,"Thanks Barry. Here's a review of the financials for the first fiscal quarter of 2021. Total revenue of $28.7 million for the first quarter increased 42% from the $20.2 million generated in the year ago period, reflecting an continuing expansion of operations and revenue following the slowdown associated with the impact of COVID-19 on the diagnostic testing sector. The consolidated gross margin for the quarter was 42%, up significantly from the 28% in the year ago period.",David Bench,4393966
,,,,
11784,Presentation,"On a sequential basis, first quarter revenue increased 47% over the fourth quarter of 2020, driven largely by COVID-19 testing. On a divisional basis, clinical services revenue increased 66% to $21.2 million from $12.8 million in the first quarter of 2020, and more than 55% sequentially. The year-over-year performance is largely driven by volume growth to approximately 300,000 accessions in the period versus approximately 200,000 in last year's first quarter. Of particular note, we saw gross margins increase to 39% from 14% in the first quarter 2020. This is largely attributed to revenue from rapid expansion of our COVID-19 testing products and services as well as ongoing cost savings initiatives.",David Bench,4393966
,,,,
11785,Presentation,"Net revenue per accession grew to more than $69 per accession versus $62 in Q1 2020 on improved testing mix. Enzo?s average product order value during the quarter increased 12% year-over-year, reflective of higher value products, such as Genomics, ELISA kits and antibodies. Enzo Life Science gross margin was 49% compared to 52% a year ago and experienced an increase of 3% from the previous quarter due to improved product mix and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We are focused on improving gross margins in the division for the coming quarters, aided by an improved mix of products being sold into a more stable marketplace.",David Bench,4393966
,,,,
11786,Presentation,"On the consolidated expense side, research and development expenses decreased 29% to less than $800,000 or 3% of total revenue from $1.1 million or 5% of total revenue in the year ago period. Selling, general and administrative expenses of $10 million or 35% of total revenue, decreased substantially from $11 million or 55% of total revenue in the year ago period. GAAP net income was $0.3 million or $0.01 per share versus a loss of $3.3 million or negative $0.07 per share last quarter and a loss of $7.7 million or negative $0.16 per share in the year ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was a positive $1 million compared to an adjusted EBITDA loss of $5.7 million in the previous year's first quarter. The significant improvement was driven mainly by increased gross margin from testing mix, lower reagent costs, reduced SG&A expenses from efficiencies and reduced intangibles and amortization costs in travel.",David Bench,4393966
,,,,
11787,Presentation,"Cash and cash equivalents totaled $46 million as of October 31st, slightly lower than the $48 million at the end of the fiscal year due to increases in accounts receivable, inventory and capital expenditures. Working capital improved to $37 million from $36 million at the start of the fiscal year. As of October 31, 2020, the company had 47.9 million shares outstanding. We remain committed to investing in our key growth areas as we expand our product and platform capabilities as an integrated solution provider of product and services in molecular diagnostics, immunoassays, cytology and immunohistochemistry. We expect this investment to yield significant gross margin improvement in a normalized post COVID environment. By combining continued revenue growth from our PCR-based testing platform and improved margins and operational discipline, we believe Enzo will benefit significantly from its position as a leading vertically integrated end-to-end diagnostic company.",David Bench,4393966

,,,,
11789,Presentation,I'll turn the call back over to Barry for closing remarks.,David Bench,4393966
,,,,
11790,Presentation,"Thanks, David. Both revenue and profit margins have increased dramatically as you can see in the recent months but perhaps more impressive is the company's transformation. We are one of the few companies to incorporate a biotech entity, a diagnostics division and a CLIA-certified clinical laboratory. Moreover, our integration has yielded advanced technology and products and platforms that are more economical, provide, in most cases, proven heightened sensitivity and compatibility with existing open systems employed throughout the diagnostics industry.",Barry Weiner,4393966
,,,,
11791,Presentation,"What is particularly evident in this most recent quarter has been our flexibility to adapt existing procedures to safely and effectively meet the demands for testing resulting from the pandemic. The advent of vaccines that hopefully will enable the world to deal with the COVID-19 virus and return to normalcy will not, in most expert opinions, lessen the need for taste testing or safeguards. This will present an opportunity for Enzo but it will also underscore the vital role of diagnostics and how they will play in the future in terms of satisfying medical needs. Regarding corporate governance, we were able to attract knowledgeable and capable new independent directors to add value and take advantage of our assets and opportunities as we grow Enzo. Our comprehensive end-to-end solution for modern clinical diagnostics and our ongoing developmental programs make us uniquely positioned within the broader molecular diagnostics market, both now and in a post COVID environment.",Barry Weiner,4393966

11792,Presentation,"With that, I will turn the call back to the operator, and we're happy to entertain questions.",Barry Weiner,4393966
,,,,
11793,Question-and-Answer,[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kyle Mikson with Cantor Fitzgerald.,Operator,4393966
,,,,
11794,Question-and-Answer,"Barry and David, congrats on all these updates here are the impressive quarter. So net revenue per session increased nicely year over year. Just was wondering how successful you are in expanding or kind of cross selling your core offerings to customers who initially had the COVID test? And I would just be great if you can provide any specific examples and how that kind of has been trending over the past couple of months?",Kyle Mikson,4393966
,,,,
11795,Question-and-Answer,"So we announced a SIT program, our school and institution testing program. And that particularly was for COVID but has extended beyond that with many schools asking us to help them with their health centers, specifically with regards to sexually transmitted diseases, but also other things within the health center. Also, with regards to other areas like nursing homes and urgent cares, we're also finding that expansion, where we open the door through implementing our COVID program but then we almost expand beyond that within all the other testing that we're able to do. So it is a very interesting model for us is that we're able to come in with the COVID and then get the breadth of services across the platform.",David Bench,4393966
,,,,
11796,Question-and-Answer,"In many respects, the COVID scenario and situation has been a showcase for Enzo to be able to demonstrate its capabilities in terms of providing services that were timely and effective, in most cases, for these providers. As you may be aware and we're witnessing today with the resurgence of the virus and the increase in testing demands out there. Many labs, specifically, some of the largest labs in our country, are now running very extended return periods for their testing. Some labs are now suggesting three to seven days return on a COVID molecular. And as we all know, getting a result in three to seven days doesn't necessarily fit the bill for exacting diagnosis or containing the spread of the disease.",Barry Weiner,4393966
,,,,
11797,Question-and-Answer,"We have been able to ensure our turnaround time for the most part, between 24 and 48 hours, and that's been our goal. I think that has been extremely well received and it has allowed us to pick up new clientele. And the clientele we have been working with and extending into is being targeted for also moving their testing, their routine testing, their existing testing beyond COVID testing into our services capability. And we believe that will serve us well in the post COVID environment as we expand both the nature and type of businesses we're servicing, as well as the breadth and scope of the testing that we're providing and expand our revenue lines and service provisions in the future period.",Barry Weiner,4393966
,,,,
11798,Question-and-Answer,,Barry Weiner,4393966
,,,,
11799,Question-and-Answer,"And I wanted to move to the Farmingdale facility too. I was wondering if there was an update there. When could the doubling of the facility be completed I guess, and can you just remind us of the annual run rate revenue that you would expect to achieve kind of regarding that facility?",Kyle Mikson,4393966
,,,,
11800,Question-and-Answer,"So we've already expanded our facilities with regards to our COVID capabilities on GenFlex. And we continue to expand that as we move forward. So that doubling of the capacity is being achieved as we speak. We're bringing on new machines, new resources and new capabilities within our molecular diagnostic areas. The full 21 exec boulevard new build that is a one to one and half year project and that's going to take some time to get there. But that is really an all-encompassing project for the company from a CapEx perspective as well as an expansion perspective.",David Bench,4393966
,,,,
11801,Question-and-Answer,"I think the acquisition of our third structure, which we announced, I would say, about a year ago, had tremendous foresight in it in light of what has taken place with COVID. We have been shifting our physical facilities around to meet the changes of structure of our employees in terms of keeping them safe. The whole COVID period was an extraordinary logistical challenge for us, where we had to move out back office staffing that could work from home where possible. We had to expand our production floor to bring in new platforms, new instrumentation to meet the accelerated demand and the demand for rapid turnaround timing. We were fraught with issues in terms of bringing in new employees. We have quite an extensive search out for bringing in strategic positions today to help us in our expansion.",Barry Weiner,4393966
,,,,
11802,Question-and-Answer,"The new facility, which is under construction, has already been utilized by certain groups that we started to bring back from home work. So that facility has proven invaluable in our ability to meet the demands, to restructure the facilities production options and capabilities. And we see over the next year, we will, one by one, be reshifting different departments and expanding our production floor to meet even greater demand that we anticipate even in the post COVID environment when we see the advent of serology tests stepping in to validate immune response based on the vaccine.",Barry Weiner,4393966
,,,,
11803,Question-and-Answer,"And kind of like similarly on the new run rate revenue is $115 million, up from $100 million. So I was wondering if you could kind of talk about the dynamics that drove that increase, like the delta there. And then as we're thinking about the full fiscal year, do you expect to reach profitability, I guess, for the full year? I know it's probably tough to kind of see to this. But what should we be thinking about quarter-to-quarter as it relates to operating expenses and maybe gross margin?",Kyle Mikson,4393966
,,,,
11804,Question-and-Answer,"So as you know, we're in turbulent times right now so it's very difficult to provide quarter-by-quarter guidance. But what I could say to you is that we are expecting, over the next few months, continued increases in the COVID testing, even pre everybody getting a vaccine, right? So that in itself should obviously lend to the comfort of our $115 plus $1 million run rate. With regards to product and services mix, we don't really speak to that yet in any real granularity. But obviously, COVID was a significant impetus to the growth. That being said, as we mentioned, our account growth also helps and has been as we open those accounts, we move them to other things within it. The last thing I need to point out, which I think is very important, is the margin expansion is not just based on COVID. There's also margin expansion as we move the rest of the molecular platform over to our GenFlex platforms. And that's important because historically, we've seen these very low margins in the lab of 15% to 25%. We expect that margin to grow beyond that, even in a normalized area now we're showing 40% plus margin in our lab. And so that helps gain that profitability that you're talking about right now within the company.",David Bench,4393966
,,,,
11805,Question-and-Answer,,David Bench,4393966
,,,,
11806,Question-and-Answer,"Just to emphasize that point because it is a very important point, the improvement in margin certainly is partially attributable to the COVID testing. But the uniqueness of our corporate structure, having both the product development manufacturing side of our business support the services side of our business, has allowed us to utilize our own equipment, our own manufactured product. And thus, we are able to extend the margin even on the, what I would call non-COVID testing areas. And we're seeing that within our numbers. Also, not to discount it at all. Over the last year, we have gone through an extensive cost containment program, which we spoke to just about a year ago and we have drawn out of the cost structure close to $10 million, which is what we targeted back then and we have successfully delivered on that promise. And that is now also being reflected in the numbers. So we have a multiplicity of contributions that are driving the margin improvement in the performance and we hope that will continue on.",Barry Weiner,4393966
,,,,
11807,Question-and-Answer,"And just kind of switching gears here. So obviously, the new directors have this like therapeutic kind of focus. And it sounds like you'll be kind of emphasizing companion diagnostics and liquid biopsy going forward. So it sounds to coming, obviously. Could you just discuss that strategy or maybe the plan with that with just a little bit more detail, maybe your goals with respect to the companion ds or the liquid biopsy, I guess, offering around, line of thought?",Kyle Mikson,4393966
,,,,
11808,Question-and-Answer,"We are looking in to extend the capabilities of our company into areas that we think we can make a material contribution and produce products and/or services that will be contributory to our higher margin returns in the diagnostics sector. Obviously, one of the key areas is the extension into liquid biopsies as we see the area of cancer diagnostics start to evolve. We see the opportunity to extend our technology platforms into the area of drug discovery, in the area of supporting CRO work and new drug development. We are already providing certain services to CROs currently. The new directors are really very focused and knowledgeable in multiple areas specifically in the area of drug discovery, of drug validation and the utility and need for companion diagnostics with the evolving new biologicals that are coming forward.",Barry Weiner,4393966
,,,,
11809,Question-and-Answer,"Enzo has a significant technology portfolio. We've spoken about it in the past. The wealth of our intellectual property state is not that well comprehended by the average investor or even the average pharmaceutical company. And we believe we can mine our technology base and apply it in areas of product development, which will give us a significant edge. And we are looking forward to these new directors who have really a very different, and I would say, significant experience base than directors we've historically had to be able not only to guide into that but to make the appropriate introductions in context to allow us to build a presence in the pharmaceutical industry that will drive not only our support work but help us perhaps in our own therapeutic efforts to bring forward opportunities that can create shareholder value.",Barry Weiner,4393966
,,,,
11810,Question-and-Answer,"And I just wanted to ask one more question, kind of a big picture question. You recently saw that, just given the recent increasing number of COVID tests being processed, there's a significant shortage of the supplies needed for SCD diagnostic tests, including the reagents. And so just was wondering if you could comment on that and then the potential impact on Enzo. And I guess, ultimately, given that SCDs are commonly asymptomatic, do you expect there could be a potential bolus of patients for your tests over the next few quarters or so?",Kyle Mikson,4393966
,,,,
11811,Question-and-Answer,,Barry Weiner,4393966
,,,,
11812,Question-and-Answer,"The answer is yes. I mean the issue of shortages in our industry has been one of the key challenges from the minute the COVID issue was recognized. I don't know if you go back. And the initial shortage that we all faced back in March and April, we couldn't get enough swabs of the specific type that were required for the molecular test. I mean this is an area I have a particular passion on because every day to make this facility and this operation work and to be able to provide the services, our customers are demanding and begging for in the early periods, requires daily review and challenges to overcome the supply chain shortages that were coming forward, not only to end so but to every laboratory in the country, as we know it. What is unique about Enzo is that fortunately, we manufacture most of our own molecular reagents. And that's really what differentiated us in the early part of this pandemic.",Barry Weiner,4393966
,,,,
11813,Question-and-Answer,"And today, it is what gives us that edge that vertical integration is now fulfilling its vision and giving us the economic edge as well as the supply edge. Now that is not to say that we still don't witness supply chain shortages. We are all witnessing it. And these shortages initially were in the swabs, then it was in the reagents. Recently, in the last month, it's been in the consumables, the plastic chips that go into the machines. What you have to appreciate, there are a limited number of global suppliers and they are being demanded on by every lab around the world. And so where we can be self sufficient and we have been extremely self sufficient and very creative in our processes to be able to manage, it has been an incredible challenge. And I think the ability that we have shown and the foresight in our own product lines, in our own design and strategy, in putting forth our own platforms, in producing our own reagents, is really starting to show itself as a strategy that it was viable and important and fulfilling its design. But still going forward, there are daily shortages on every level. And it will be a continuous problem as the demand on testing continues to expand, and it looks like it will continue to expand.",Barry Weiner,4393966
,,,,
11814,Question-and-Answer,Our next question comes from Thomas O with Evermore Global.,Operator,4393966
,,,,
11815,Question-and-Answer,"Just wanted to say congrats on the quarter. Great job on quickly ramping up on the GenFlex platform to deal with COVID-19. Look, you guys are working on a lot of initiatives concurrently, and it would be helpful if you could just kind of walk us through on how you're thinking about the next phase for Enzo as it relates to priorities post pandemic.",Thomas O,4393966
,,,,
11816,Question-and-Answer,"We are wishful and hopeful that the vaccine will temper this virus and get us all back to normalcy, obviously. It has allowed Enzo to showcase itself. I think it is provided the environment for Enzo's strengths to become visible and not only visible on an observation level but visible on a production and product level to multiple customers around the world. That being said, post COVID and we are acutely aware that at a point in time, there will be a shift, a potential shift in necessity in need in the marketplace. Right now, molecular testing is the gold standard. We have seen the introduction of a number of rapid tests. I think the sensitivity and specificity of those tests has now demonstrated that they may serve a purpose, but they certainly are not the answer that the molecular test gives in terms of accuracy and immediacy for contagious issues here.",Barry Weiner,4393966
,,,,
11817,Question-and-Answer,"That being said, what we believe will happen in a post COVID environment as the vaccine begins to become more extensively applied, will be the need for testing to validate and verify immunity. That means the serological test will be one that we think will have to be employed by those who are vaccinated to validate whether they have antibody production, the sustainability of that production. I mean, you have to remember that the vaccine still is yet unproven in terms of its durability. It's interesting as recently as this morning I was reading a scientific study on one of the vaccines, which said that they're hopeful it has a six month antibody sustainability. They don't have enough time but they're already seeing it fall off. That means that testing will be predicated and necessary as long as this virus is proliferative. And we believe that our program to address that is comprehensive. We currently are running IgG tests for the antibody but we think there will be a need for IGM, IGA and another series of more rapid types of test for people to say, I've been vaccinated. I'm immune. And I think when you look at the numbers that that might drive, the numbers of people that will be vaccinated, I think it will be another leg to the COVID testing story.",Barry Weiner,4393966
,,,,
11818,Question-and-Answer,,Barry Weiner,4393966
,,,,
11819,Question-and-Answer,"We also see and we're very focused on building our business and capitalizing on the goodwill of the large number of new accounts that we have been able to bring in-house because of COVID testing. And I mean, I do know we have taken business from many of the larger labs because of our rapid turnaround time, because of our service levels. I mean, it's interesting to see the universities and the school programs that we've put together. At the universities, we have teams of swabbers that are there every day on-campus taking samples from the students. We're not just the processor, we're facilitating the testing capability of these universities. And that has, by word of mouth spread and we're getting new business because of the quality job that we're doing in our existing institutions that we're servicing, to the point that we actually have to be measured in terms of us being able to be able to manage the volumes that are being presented to us. So we see the future as leading not only to COVID testing, but we're now taking specimens from school health services. Obviously, the STD market there is high and that's one that fits very well with our molecular platform. We had approval for our STD panel pre COVID and now we're able to extend that into these higher level academic institutions.",Barry Weiner,4393966
,,,,
11820,Question-and-Answer,"Nursing homes another interesting model for us. Pre COVID, we did not do a lot of nursing home business. Post COVID, we not only feel that we will be able to do ongoing COVID testing but we will hopefully be able to get the other, what I would call, legacy or routine business, which is quite significant from these nursing home clientele because again, we provide a level of service, which is special in our industry. So I think there are programs in place. We're looking at new types of tests. We're looking at service provision that I think is unique in the market, and we hope that will extend and grow this business significantly in the next six to 12 months. Also just one other comment, it?s on the direct to consumer initiatives and the point of care testing. The direct to consumer is just starting now. I mean we're getting interest and activity on our website. People are not taking the direct to consumer test to our portal. And the point of care test will be very interesting because it will dovetail with that program. So I think there are many initiatives. The technology development cycle is aggressive, but we're addressing it very readily now.",Barry Weiner,4393966
,,,,
11821,Question-and-Answer,"And I just had one more question. You mentioned the launch of this new portable microplate reader. I guess the question is twofold. One, how should we think about the launch in terms of time line to commercialize? And two, is there currently any existing technology out there where your product is looking to effectively displace it?",Thomas O,4393966
,,,,
11822,Question-and-Answer,"The launch is ongoing as we speak right now. This device is a very, very -- it's a very unique and clever device. It actually looks like a 5-inch by 8-inch cell phone-type device. It fits a little plate that you put samples into. And you plug it right into your computer. And it will initially have applicability in an academic setting and in a research setting, because it allows scientists or researchers just to plug right into their computer and run their specimens very quickly and efficiently without using equipment that might be shared or have a location difference from what they're doing. It's a very, very clever device. The whole purpose of it is to drive our extensive ELISA kit program.",Barry Weiner,4393966
,,,,
11823,Question-and-Answer,"I mean we have -- we are a marketer of many kits that are targeting all sorts of developmental interests for researchers and academics. If you look on our catalog on our website, you'll see hundreds of these tests and this device is to provide us a complete solution for these researchers. And it's a sense to drive the utility of our ELISA offerings. So it has both uniqueness in size and convenience and cost. And at the end of the day, ELISA readers are prolific throughout the industry but it's almost like a new model of your cell phone that can work with your computer and give you independence and autonomy from your laboratory. So we think it has some legs to it and we're very excited about it. It's just beginning now.",Barry Weiner,4393966
,,,,
11824,Question-and-Answer,,Barry Weiner,4393966
,,,,
11825,Question-and-Answer,Next question comes from Paul Nouri with Noble Equity.,Operator,4393966
,,,,
11826,Question-and-Answer,"So the products that you got EUAs for, are you actually selling those into the market or are you primarily using those for your own lab?",Paul Nouri,4393966
,,,,
11827,Question-and-Answer,"Our own lab has been the major customer because of supply chain requirements. We have interest from other entities and institutions for our platforms. But because of the supply chain needs, we have been slow in providing those, because the utility is being absorbed by our own lab. And thus, the margins there are quite good for us in doing that but we're looking forward as we have both US and international interest. And over the next few months or so, we hope that as the supply chain eases, we'll be able to start to ease those products into the market.",Barry Weiner,4393966
,,,,
11828,Question-and-Answer,"And the press release said that the company was in the process of evaluating business opportunities. I was wondering if you could expand on the areas that you're most interested in or what exactly this means? I mean, does it mean more that you're looking to make tuck-in acquisitions in areas of technology that you're looking to expand in or perhaps divestments? And then I guess, related to that one of the activist investors brought up that the company had engaged Lazard. And I was wondering if there was any update on that or any information related to that.",Paul Nouri,4393966
,,,,
11829,Question-and-Answer,"The statement applies to a variety of different opportunities. Unlike many companies, we have multiple developmental options to exploit. Specifically, we have four major platforms that have been under development, each being developed to provide unique capabilities to the market. The GenFlex, which we speak about for our molecular platform, is the most developed of all. It's being worked. We have multiple platforms running every day in our lab, processing not only COVID but a variety of molecular tests. We have a program in the area of immunohistochemistry, we have one in the area of cytology and we have one in the area of immunoassay development. Our goal is to fully develop each of these four platforms into independent value centers. And to do such, we have a limited number of areas on our own that we can fully exploit, particularly in the hectic environment that we're dealing today with COVID.",Barry Weiner,4393966
,,,,
11830,Question-and-Answer,"And the statement really applies to dialog with potential partners, co-developers of our platforms to establish them as independent value centers. And we believe that the intrinsic value that sits within each of these platforms, when broken apart from the overall totality of Enzo's work, can be brought to light. And that's where we are looking to leverage our assets and to apply them in those areas. In terms of the relationship with Lazard, the COVID environment certainly has created diversion. There's not much to say on that as of this point in time. But we will, if anything develop, certainly report that in the market in a timely fashion.",Barry Weiner,4393966
,,,,
11831,Question-and-Answer,And then is there any update on any of the lawsuits that you guys have pursued against industry peers?,Paul Nouri,4393966
,,,,
11832,Question-and-Answer,"Nothing, I mean, everything that the current update will be provided in the 10-Q. But these are ongoing issues. As you know, the courts during the COVID issue have been somewhat limited in their execution. So the whole period has been stunted by the COVID environment.",Barry Weiner,4393966
,,,,
11833,Question-and-Answer,I would like to turn the floor over to Barry for closing remarks.,Operator,4393966
,,,,
11834,Question-and-Answer,"Well, thank you so much for joining us today. While we are very proud of our revenue growth and profitability achieved this quarter, it is really only one step in transforming Enzo into an integrated end to end diagnostic products and solutions company and building and investing in the infrastructure for growth. We look forward to the next quarter or two quarters as we drive much of the developments and the opportunities that we've reported on today. We are looking forward to a very exciting period, though challenging period. I have to tell you, the workforce here has been pushed to its limits and they have actually responded well to the challenges. But this is an ongoing scenario. We have a lot on our plate.

Based on current guidance with our partners, we expect the December quarter to be at about 60% of pre-COVID levels and roughly 70% for the March quarter. Based on high level projections from one of our partners, we believe block hour utilization will continue to increase and reach pre-COVID levels by the end of the calendar year.",Brad Rich,4393961
,,,,
11859,Presentation,"I might not like to provide an update on our American operation relationship. We recently amended our CPA to operate 40 of our CRJ-900 aircraft for a term of five years. Our current fleet, as many of you know, is 64 CRJ-900 and that will reduce to 63 in June of 2021.",Brad Rich,4393961
,,,,
11860,Presentation,"Of these 63 aircraft, we own 48 and 41 of those are financed under our recently announced U.S. Treasury loan. We also have 15 aircraft leased through 2024. We will be using the majority of these aircraft to support the American operation. However, we are reviewing several new opportunities that would productively utilize some of these aircraft.",Brad Rich,4393961
,,,,
11861,Presentation,"Given the attractive financing and low debt balance on a majority of the fleet, we believe these aircraft are valuable assets and will remain productive. Additionally, American has requested that we pick up additional flying over the first half of calendar year 2021 over and above the new CPA levels. Although, we have not formalized an agreement, we believe this could result in three to five additional lines of flying.",Brad Rich,4393961
,,,,
11862,Presentation,"Obviously, this new agreement with American was extremely important to Mesa. Getting it done in this difficult and challenging environment was not easy and we are excited and pleased to continue our relationship with American that began over 30 years ago.",Brad Rich,4393961
,,,,
11863,Presentation,"And I would like to thank American Eagle leadership, including Devon May, Mark Moessner and George Stahle for their hard work and support. We did offer rates that we believe are competitive and appropriate considering the reduced aircraft ownership previously discussed. This agreement also demonstrates our ability to provide rates that we believe are industry leading.",Brad Rich,4393961
,,,,
11864,Presentation,,Brad Rich,4393961
,,,,
11865,Presentation,"And now moving to an update of our United operation. As Jon -- as Jonathan pointed out, we have already added 10 new Embraer E175 LL aircraft that are scheduled and are scheduled to add six more this month. The last four will be delivered in the first half of calendar year 2021.",Brad Rich,4393961
,,,,
11866,Presentation,"As we add these aircraft to the United fleet, we are removing our CRJ-700s on a one for one basis. These aircraft will be leased to another United operator on a seven-year term. We are retraining most of the current CRJ-700 pilots and dowless on the Embraer 175 and most of that training expense will be covered by the training credits that are part of the purchase agreement. Within the next six months we will be operating a single fleet of 80 Embraer 175s with United, which will enhance operational performance and improve cost efficiencies.",Brad Rich,4393961
,,,,
11867,Presentation,"In regards to our cargo operations, we have two 737-400 cargo aircraft in service with DHL. Both aircraft are based in Cincinnati where we have a pilot domiciled and a maintenance base. So far we have been pleased with the operation and believe we are well-positioned to grow this line of business.",Brad Rich,4393961
,,,,
11868,Presentation,"With that, I?d now like to turn it over to Mike Lotz to walk through our financial performance.",Brad Rich,4393961
,,,,
11869,Presentation,"Great. Thanks, Brad. Let me give a quick recap on the earnings for the fourth quarter. Fiscal 2020, we recorded net income of $11.4 million or $0.32 per share. This compares a net income of $12.2 million for the same quarter last year or $0.35 per diluted share.",Mike Lotz,4393961
,,,,
11870,Presentation,"As noted in our press release, the Q4 2020 results include for GAAP the deferral of $7.8 million of CPA revenue, all of which was billed and paid by American and United during the quarter and will be recognized over the remaining term of the CPAs.",Mike Lotz,4393961
,,,,
11871,Presentation,"During the quarter we also recognize $48 point -- $40.8 million as an offset to wages relating to the previous announced PSP program. We did record $3.2 million of income tax expense for the quarter. However, we did not pay any cash taxes as we have over $500 million valuable NOL carry forward.",Mike Lotz,4393961
,,,,
11872,Presentation,"For the full year 2020, we reported net income of $27.5 million or $0.78 per diluted share, compared to $47.6 million or $1.36 per diluted share last year. As noted in our press release also 2020 results include again for GAAP the deferral of $43.8 million of CPA revenue, which was deferred and will be recognized over the remaining term of the CPA.",Mike Lotz,4393961
,,,,
11873,Presentation,"During the quarter we also recognize $83.8 million as an offset to wages related to the PSP program. Of note, the total PSP grant of $95.2 million, which initially was $92.5 million and then reallocated up to the $95.2, we recognized $83.8 million in fiscal 2020 and expect to recognize remaining balance in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. For the year we reported $9.5 million of income tax expense, and as we noted, we have not paid any cash taxes.",Mike Lotz,4393961
,,,,
11874,Presentation,"Quarter-over-quarter revenues down $79.8 million or 42% and $178.7 million or $108 million and for the year, revenue was down $178 million or 25% and $723.4 million and 545.1 million.",Mike Lotz,4393961
,,,,
11875,Presentation,Cash for the quarter increased by $34.5 million to $99.4 million. During the quarter we had CapEx expense of $1.5 million. We also paid $34.6 million in scheduled principal payments and we had deferred principal payments of $14 million in the quarter. In total we have deferred $28.1 million in principal payments since March.,Mike Lotz,4393961
,,,,
11876,Presentation,"I?d also like to now walk you through the very important U.S. Treasury loan which we recently closed on which I can tell you with a lot of effort, a lot of people within the company. At a high level, our total loan is $195 million. The first tranche funding was $43 million and was collateralized with existing unencumbered assets.",Mike Lotz,4393961
,,,,
11877,Presentation,Prior to the second tranche we extinguished $164 million of debt to unencumbered 44 aircraft using the combination of $83 million cash on hand and $81 million of prepaid CPA revenue from United. The second tranche funding was $152 million collateralized with the 44 aircraft for total $195 million.,Mike Lotz,4393961
,,,,
11878,Presentation,,Mike Lotz,4393961
,,,,
11879,Presentation,"Net cash generated was $31 million, which is $195 million plus $164 million in debt was -- that was -- in debt that was extinguished. The U.S. Treasury debt, we said at LIBOR plus 3.50%. It is interest-only, while the debt that we extinguished was fully amortizing debt. As a result, scheduled principal payments going forward are significantly lower, if we choose not to repay the Treasury loan, which we have an option to do.",Mike Lotz,4393961
,,,,
11880,Presentation,"To put this into context, prior to the Treasury loan, for example, fiscal year 2021 had $189 million of scheduled principal payments, which will be reduced to $96 million, a reduction of $93 million and for fiscal 2022, scheduled principal payments are reduced from $152 million to $91 million, a reduction of $62 million.",Mike Lotz,4393961
,,,,
11881,Presentation,"In the next two fiscal years, scheduled principal payments are being reduced by $154 million. Also as part of a loan agreement, we did issue $4.9 million warrants for the U.S. Treasury that was struck at $3.98.",Mike Lotz,4393961
,,,,
11882,Presentation,"I?d like to touch on a few other items, included in the $164 million of debt that we extinguished was $21 million of the $28 million of total principal deferrals that we have through the end of the fiscal year. The remaining $7 million of deferrals, plus an additional $12 million, which we are differing between October and July, will all be repaid in August. We also negotiated total prepayment discounts of roughly $3.5 million.",Mike Lotz,4393961
,,,,
11883,Presentation,"At fiscal year end, we had $22.9 million outstanding under our CIT revolver, which we are considering repaying now that we have closed on our Treasury loan. The $81 million United prepaid revenue received in November is expected to be reduced to zero by approximately February.",Mike Lotz,4393961
,,,,
11884,Presentation,"CapEx for 2021 will primarily be our purchase of 20 engines from GE for roughly $110 million. Currently, 10 of those engines are scheduled for delivery in 2021 and 10 for 2022. We are currently in discussions with various parties on financing and lease options, as well as discussions with GE to modify the delivery schedule.",Mike Lotz,4393961
,,,,
11885,Presentation,"Other cash items related to fiscal 2021, scheduled aircraft lease cash payments will exceed book expense by roughly $9 million. We continue to manage our vendor payments and have moved a significant number of our vendors to net 60, up from net 15 and net 30. For fiscal year 2021, we will be performing heavy maintenance that was previously deferred due to lower aircraft utilization levels in fiscal 2020.",Mike Lotz,4393961
,,,,
11886,Presentation,"Lastly, as we look at the new American CPA terms for the 40 aircraft and the new E175 terms for the 20 new aircraft, we expect our pre-tax margins to be consistent with the past few years. Obviously, in this environment, there are a lot of areas that could impact these numbers both positively or negatively and due to this uncertainty, we are not offering any guidance at this time.",Mike Lotz,4393961
,,,,
11887,Presentation,I?d like to now turn it back over to Jon.,Mike Lotz,4393961
,,,,
11888,Presentation,"Thank you, Mike, and we appreciate the financial recap. At this point, Operator, I?d be happy to field any questions that come from any of the listeners.",Jonathan Ornstein,4393961
,,,,
11889,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Savi Syth from Raymond James. You may go ahead.",Operator,4393961
,,,,
11890,Question-and-Answer,"Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. If I could help us with some of those deferred costs showing up and some of the deferred revenue happening, could you give us an idea of, maybe the progression I know -- the timing of everything is not exact, but any color on the progression of kind of the revenue build and the cost build in fiscal year ?21?",Savi Syth,4393961
,,,,
11891,Question-and-Answer,"Mike, do you want to do that? Hello.",Jonathan Ornstein,4393961
,,,,
11892,Question-and-Answer,Yes. I got it. Thank you.,Mike Lotz,4393961
,,,,
11893,Question-and-Answer,Yeah.,Jonathan Ornstein,4393961
,,,,
11894,Question-and-Answer,"Hey, Savi. This is Mike. So most of our revenue growth is going to be based on our block hour production. We did give guidance for the first two quarters. Third quarter and fourth quarter is a little hard for us to predict.",Mike Lotz,4393961
,,,,
11895,Question-and-Answer,,Mike Lotz,4393961
,,,,
11896,Question-and-Answer,"We have gotten some indication from our partners that it?s going to be increased. But we are just not in a position right now to give those from block hour projections for Q3 and Q4. But from a revenue build, that will primarily just be driven by our block hours.",Mike Lotz,4393961
,,,,
11897,Question-and-Answer,"And on the cost side, our costs are going to be fairly consistent and we did have this deferral of some of our heavy maintenance on the airplanes that we are deferring from 2020 and we are seeing a lot of that in 2021.",Mike Lotz,4393961
,,,,
11898,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. Did those deferrals show up in the off -- should we assume kind of off-peak quarters, Mike, and so they are kind of heavy on those time periods or -- and then also do you have an update on any kind of those pass-through costs or are they part of going to be some of the other agreements?",Savi Syth,4393961
,,,,
11899,Question-and-Answer,"No. Some of them are pass-through, but most of them are for the Mesa responsibility. And as far as timing, I think, it would be more likely in the front half of the year than the tail half.",Mike Lotz,4393961
,,,,
11900,Question-and-Answer,"Makes sense. And then just one last clarification, the request from American that you are still working on for additional block hours line, that -- is that in the guidance or that would be above and beyond what?s in the guidance?",Savi Syth,4393961
,,,,
11901,Question-and-Answer,I believe that?s in the guidance.,Mike Lotz,4393961
,,,,
11902,Question-and-Answer,Okay. Thank you.,Savi Syth,4393961
,,,,
11903,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you. Our next question comes from Bert Subin with Stifel. You may go ahead, sir.",Operator,4393961
,,,,
11904,Question-and-Answer,"Hey. This is a Bert Subin with Stifel. Thanks for the time and good afternoon. Over the last couple of quarters, you have highlighted very strong controllable completion factors, almost pretty much as close as you can get to a 100%. What gives you confidence you can run this strong in operation and block hours start to come back and maybe you don?t have the same degree of sparing that you have now?",Bert Subin,4393961
,,,,
11905,Question-and-Answer,"Well, I will take a shot and Brad I am happy to have you add into that. First on the American side, we will have significantly more spares than we have ever had. So I think we would probably be okay there. This is really depends on what ultimately happens with those aircraft. We certainly will make sure that we have the adequate spares to operate at the levels that are above and beyond and I think that having those spare aircraft allows us to do that.",Jonathan Ornstein,4393961
,,,,
11906,Question-and-Answer,"On the United side, we have continued to operate. We have always operated for United above any contractual requirements. We have done a really good job. We have a lot of new aircraft there and we have adequate sparing plus.",Jonathan Ornstein,4393961
,,,,
11907,Question-and-Answer,"I think a big part of what goes on with United is we have two big maintenance bases that allow us to see a lot of aircraft and we don?t see any real changes there. So I think we feel very confident, particularly with the age of the fleet at United. Brad, do you want to add anything to that?",Jonathan Ornstein,4393961
,,,,
11908,Question-and-Answer,"I think, no, Jonathan. I think the two main things are, look, we are excited to move to one consistent fleet of Embraer 175s on the United side, which will really enhance operational reliability we believe. And then, as Jonathan already said, on the American side, we will be adequately spared.",Brad Rich,4393961
,,,,
11909,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. No. I appreciate that. I guess, I am just wondering if some of the spares come down, you said there is potentially some productive use for some of those aircraft, if you expect that to have an impact or not really?",Bert Subin,4393961
,,,,
11910,Question-and-Answer,"I don?t think we wouldn?t jeopardize anything at American by pulling more aircraft out than we feel comfortable with. As a result of the financing that made available to us under the Treasury loan. These aircraft become financially much less of a burden and having the additional spare aircraft is something we want to do to continue to build -- even after 30 years, we continue to build the confidence of our partners. So I just don?t think we?d let it get to that point where we felt that we are not adequately spared.",Jonathan Ornstein,4393961
,,,,
11911,Question-and-Answer,,Jonathan Ornstein,4393961
,,,,
11912,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. Great. Thanks. That?s helpful color. Just one more as a follow-up, Jonathan, last quarter, you said you think there is greater opportunity on the regional side than the cargo side. I assume you still think that?s the case, but just wondering if you had any commentary around that?",Bert Subin,4393961
,,,,
11913,Question-and-Answer,"Well, no, I think, that my view on that is the regional business is clearly our core business and we do think that there continues to be some very good opportunities in the regional side. In terms of the cargo business, I mean, I think, that no one imagined the strength that we have seen in the cargo side and the opportunities that exist.",Jonathan Ornstein,4393961
,,,,
11914,Question-and-Answer,"The difference there is our partners at American, United and other mainline carriers, we will do deals 10, 20 aircraft at a time, whereas on the cargo side, they have a tenancy just to be a lot more incremental. And so, I think, for that reason, the cargo business will build, but potentially not at the same rate as we could potentially move the regional business.",Jonathan Ornstein,4393961
,,,,
11915,Question-and-Answer,"But that being said, I do think that the cargo business does provide us with some pretty significant opportunity, but it?s just maybe taking a little -- it takes a little bit longer to develop. At United, we went from literally 20 airplanes to 80 airplanes in a matter of a few years, I just think it?s going to, to do that kind of growth in the cargo business will take some time.",Jonathan Ornstein,4393961
,,,,
11916,Question-and-Answer,Thanks for the time.,Bert Subin,4393961
,,,,
11917,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Sir, you may go ahead.",Operator,4393961
,,,,
11918,Question-and-Answer,"Oh! Hey. Hey, everyone. Hey, Jonathan. Just two on the cargo piece to kind of follow up on that, like when we think about how big that could be in two or three years? Are we talking what six, eight, 10 airplanes, do you get to a dozen airplanes? Just if you can sort of frame the expectations for us? And then I have a second one.",Mike Linenberg,4393961
,,,,
11919,Question-and-Answer,"Sure. Well, we think the 737-400 continues to have a long-term attraction to the different cargo operations because of very good niche. We are looking at other aircraft types as well and I think they will probably move to 737-800s at some point.",Jonathan Ornstein,4393961
,,,,
11920,Question-and-Answer,"We are also looking at smaller aircraft. There seems to be a great need to get more products out to more places faster with the advent of overnight delivery literally to everywhere in the country, which has been exacerbated by the pandemic and I don?t think it?s going to go away anytime soon. And I think that as a result, we are going to continue to pursue what we think our number of attractive cargo opportunities.",Jonathan Ornstein,4393961
,,,,
11921,Question-and-Answer,"How fast they develop and how quick? I think is speculation. But I would be very surprised if we weren?t significantly larger than we are today with only two aircraft and in a year or two. And again, that?s just based on our existing business with -- our business with DHL.",Jonathan Ornstein,4393961
,,,,
11922,Question-and-Answer,"So I think that, like I said, the cargo operators take things a little bit more incrementally. But that being said, I think over time, we continue to build that operation nicely over the next couple of years.",Jonathan Ornstein,4393961
,,,,
11923,Question-and-Answer,"And I would like to think that we could add -- it would be nice if we could add an airplane every other month there somewhere in that kind of range. I think if we were at 10 and 12 airplanes in two years, I think, we?d be pretty happy.",Jonathan Ornstein,4393961
,,,,
11924,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. Great. And then just a question on, Mike, you gave us a lot of numbers on where you were a year -- fiscal year end from a liquidity perspective and now you have closed the other part of the loan. You talked about maybe paying down the CIT line of credit. How much -- can you just tell us how much capacity you have available on that CIT line and maybe give us a ballpark a calendar year end liquidity level, like, what we should be kind of honing in on? Thanks.",Mike Linenberg,4393961
,,,,
11925,Question-and-Answer,,Mike Linenberg,4393961
,,,,
11926,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. So the CIT that we have out, I think, it?s roughly $23 million, $24 million. I think that?s about the amount that we have collateral to support under that facility. I think the actual facility may be for $35 million. But it?s based on the collateral, I think, we are probably cap it like $25 million, of which we have the most of it drawn down.",Mike Lotz,4393961
,,,,
11927,Question-and-Answer,Okay.,Mike Linenberg,4393961
,,,,
11928,Question-and-Answer,"And based on the Treasury loan and where we see liquidity, we are evaluating just paying that down keeping it in place, of course, just paying it down. And year-end liquidity is a little tricky right now. But we are not sure how much of the United prepayment will be burned off. So I prefer to hold off on kind of predicting cash for the year end right now.",Mike Lotz,4393961
,,,,
11929,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. Very good. Thanks. Thanks, Mike. Thanks, Jonathan.",Mike Linenberg,4393961
,,,,
11930,Question-and-Answer,Yeah.,Mike Lotz,4393961
,,,,
11931,Question-and-Answer,Sure. Thanks.,Jonathan Ornstein,4393961
,,,,
11932,Question-and-Answer,And our next question comes from Helane Becker with Cowen. You may go ahead.,Operator,4393961
,,,,
11933,Question-and-Answer,"Thanks very much, Operator. Hi, everybody, and thank you very much for the time. So one kind of a net question, your liabilities on the current liability line and the non-current liability line don?t add up on the balance sheet you provided today. It?s -- those lines are off by a little bit of money, so you might want to look at that or trying to figure out why they are not adding? And then, my second question is with respect to the operation. The fact that you guys are running a really good on-time performance and a good operation right now, just that -- are you getting more inbounds for people wanting -- from other airlines wanting to sign you up since you have the capacity and you are one of the few airlines that?s profitable?",Helane Becker,4393961
,,,,
11934,Question-and-Answer,"First -- let me address the first question, Helane, since you and I have known each other a long time. It?s not the first time that you have pointed out an error and have been correct. So we would certainly take a good look at that and make sure that we have the numbers right. So, thank you.",Jonathan Ornstein,4393961
,,,,
11935,Question-and-Answer,Oh! My god. I am so sorry and I feel really bad.,Helane Becker,4393961
,,,,
11936,Question-and-Answer,"All right. Don?t worry about it. It?s fine. I mean, I was just commenting today that when you run a big operation of any kind occasionally something slips through the cracks. So let us take a look at it and make sure that we have it right.",Jonathan Ornstein,4393961
,,,,
11937,Question-and-Answer,"On the second question, yeah, I think that we have really established ourselves as one of the leading regional carriers, and hopefully, one of the leading cargo carriers. There is certainly opportunity within the regional business as other CPAs have aircraft that are expiring.",Jonathan Ornstein,4393961
,,,,
11938,Question-and-Answer,And our cost structure we feel is significantly below our major competitors. We think that in all probability the likelihood to be able to catch our cost structure is very low because so much of our cost structure is based on the fact that I think the last time I looked half of our employees have less than two years? seniority. So we have a young junior workforce that gives us some benefits there.,Jonathan Ornstein,4393961
,,,,
11939,Question-and-Answer,"So, yeah, and I think that both in the regional side and in the cargo side when there are RFPs out there, I think, Mesa will in fact be included going forward. So I do feel that we can win business both on our costs and also on the level of service that we can provide.",Jonathan Ornstein,4393961
,,,,
11940,Question-and-Answer,"Believe me, we know that we are being tested right now by DHL and we are doing everything we can to provide the highest quality business because we believe that there could be some growth coming in that regard, but we know that performance is critical. So?",Jonathan Ornstein,4393961
,,,,
11941,Question-and-Answer,Okay.,Helane Becker,4393961
,,,,
11942,Question-and-Answer,"? I do think that it?s been helpful to us and obviously, we have to build on this coming out of the pandemic to demonstrate that what we have done here is building the base for us to continue to grow the business.",Jonathan Ornstein,4393961
,,,,
11943,Question-and-Answer,,Jonathan Ornstein,4393961
,,,,
11944,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. That?s -- Jonathan, that?s really helpful. Thank you so much. Sorry about that my addition there. But the other?",Helane Becker,4393961
,,,,
11945,Question-and-Answer,Don?t worry about it.,Jonathan Ornstein,4393961
,,,,
11946,Question-and-Answer,"The other thing I wanted to ask is, one of the things I am starting to see a lot of in the trade press is biometrics and on the use of that at airports and with the airlines and stuff. And I am wondering if either of your two partners have talked to you about making sure all of your gates and your boarding processes that are consistent with theirs as they move to that over the next few years?",Helane Becker,4393961
,,,,
11947,Question-and-Answer,"Well, Brad, do you want to answer that? You were at United. You probably have a better feel for that than I do, any thoughts?",Jonathan Ornstein,4393961
,,,,
11948,Question-and-Answer,"I apologize, Helane. Can you restate the question? I am sorry.",Brad Rich,4393961
,,,,
11949,Question-and-Answer,Oh! Yeah. No worries. It?s just -- I am seeing a lot of stuff on biometrics and the use of biometrics?,Helane Becker,4393961
,,,,
11950,Question-and-Answer,Yeah.,Brad Rich,4393961
,,,,
11951,Question-and-Answer,"? to board people, and I guess, we are going to that because you don?t -- we are going to -- it looks to me like we are going to a touchless environment at airports and so on from a health perspective, even after the pandemic goes away. And I am just kind of wondering if you are partners have approached you about making sure all of your airports are consistent with that?",Helane Becker,4393961
,,,,
11952,Question-and-Answer,"So, the part of that obviously that we control is, I mean, we obviously stay in very close contact and follow the guidance of our partners as you well know. And your question is, have they approached us? Not with anything to the level that you have described.",Brad Rich,4393961
,,,,
11953,Question-and-Answer,"Are we making advances and progressions more toward the type of environment you have kind of described? Certainly. But how quickly things continue to develop at least to the extent you have described? I am obviously not very well qualified to address other than we just keep in touch with them closely, follow what the guidance they ask.",Brad Rich,4393961
,,,,
11954,Question-and-Answer,"And then as it relates to our own operation, our own people, of course, we are doing everything I think humanly possible to keep people safe in this environment, but those are my only thoughts, Helane.",Brad Rich,4393961
,,,,
11955,Question-and-Answer,"Got you. That?s really helpful. Okay. Thanks, gentlemen. Thanks for the -- thanks for now.",Helane Becker,4393961
,,,,
11956,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from George Stien with Corre Partners. Sir, you may go ahead.",Operator,4393961
,,,,
11957,Question-and-Answer,"Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a great quarter. And Mike, this question is on the -- I wanted to restate maybe something that Mike was asking is, maybe if you could just give us a lens into the cash balance as of today are roughly around today where the UAL prepayment stands in gross debt?",George Stien,4393961
,,,,
11958,Question-and-Answer,"I mean, yeah, look, we are fairly closer to the end of the calendar year. So we look at year end cash at probably somewhere around $170 million, of which probably at least half, $40 million to $50 million of that is still United prepaid cash that they have to burn off.",Mike Lotz,4393961
,,,,
11959,Question-and-Answer,Got you. Can you remind me of the -- so the CARES Act loan where the LTV stands on that one for the covenant or where you guys?,George Stien,4393961
,,,,
11960,Question-and-Answer,I?d say?,Mike Lotz,4393961
,,,,
11961,Question-and-Answer,? landed on a LTV basis for the collateral?,George Stien,4393961
,,,,
11962,Question-and-Answer,"Of the -- yeah. So the loan was based on an LTV, it was different for different types of equipment, but it was 50% on an aircraft with the majority of our loan was based on and the test going forward is 66.2% LTV. So there is some amount of cushion there as we test the collateral, I think, twice a year.",Mike Lotz,4393961
,,,,
11963,Question-and-Answer,"But I guess as kind of round numbers today are getting close to year end, somewhere around $130 million to $120 million of cash net of the UAL plus, I guess, conceivably doubly collateralized CARES Act loan of $195 million and I guess, of course, net that against the market cap of $150 million, is that kind of -- those rough numbers add up?",George Stien,4393961
,,,,
11964,Question-and-Answer,,George Stien,4393961
,,,,
11965,Question-and-Answer,Okay. Yeah. That?s correct.,Mike Lotz,4393961
,,,,
11966,Question-and-Answer,Okay. That?s it for me. Thanks.,George Stien,4393961
,,,,
11967,Question-and-Answer,You bet.,Mike Lotz,4393961
,,,,
11968,Question-and-Answer,And the next question comes from Savi Syth from Raymond James.,Operator,4393961
,,,,
11969,Question-and-Answer,"Hey guys. Thanks for the follow-up. Could you talk a little bit about with the American contract, what?s the threshold that American needs to come down on their mainline fleet for them to be able to take aircraft out in the first half of the year? And also just could you provide an update on the white tail risk, especially if American kind of pulls out aircraft from that contract as they are able to?",Savi Syth,4393961
,,,,
11970,Question-and-Answer,"Brad, do you want to do that?",Jonathan Ornstein,4393961
,,,,
11971,Question-and-Answer,"Well, sure. Look, we -- I want to be a little careful here becoming a spokesman for American. And all of the discussions we have had and Savi, I think, your question is, is in the -- it?s related to the first half of 2021, is that correct?",Brad Rich,4393961
,,,,
11972,Question-and-Answer,Okay. That?s correct.,Savi Syth,4393961
,,,,
11973,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. Yeah. So, look, we -- in all the discussions we have had with American, the -- we think there is a threshold here of about another 40 aircraft of reduction that would then trigger some type of an issue with their scope. But look I want to be careful of that because it?s Americans to describe, not us, but that?s what we believe.",Brad Rich,4393961
,,,,
11974,Question-and-Answer,"And so -- and if you think of 40 additional narrow-body reductions in excess of the current reduction, that?s quite a few airplanes, which we think would be pretty minimal risk for us, especially in environment where, as we mentioned, we are having more discussion about potentially additional flying above and beyond the 40 aircraft. So we -- having said all of that, we really -- we don?t know exactly what?s going to happen, of course, but we think there is relative -- relatively small risk in those first six months.",Brad Rich,4393961
,,,,
11975,Question-and-Answer,Makes sense. And just kind of curious?,Savi Syth,4393961
,,,,
11976,Question-and-Answer,Okay.,Brad Rich,4393961
,,,,
11977,Question-and-Answer,"? what the white -- updated white tail risk and maybe more so because it?s not the CRJ-900s I think have been pledged as well, just kind of curious what the kind of updated white tail risk is?",Savi Syth,4393961
,,,,
11978,Question-and-Answer,"Mike, I am happy to make some comments, but do you want to take the tail risk part?",Brad Rich,4393961
,,,,
11979,Question-and-Answer,Yeah. So what -- you talked about lease exposure?,Mike Lotz,4393961
,,,,
11980,Question-and-Answer,Exactly. Lease and debt payments that might go beyond.,Savi Syth,4393961
,,,,
11981,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. Yeah, I mean our tail risk has always -- it?s really related to the lease aircraft and there is 15 of them. And I think we have always said it?s somewhere around $25 million to $30 million and it?s a tail that occurs not until I think that the first or second calendar quarter of 2024. So that number really hasn?t changed, and of course, the aircraft are fungible, but those 15 aircraft are in the fleet.",Mike Lotz,4393961
,,,,
11982,Question-and-Answer,Makes sense. All right. Thank you.,Savi Syth,4393961
,,,,
11983,Question-and-Answer,"And at this time, I am showing no further questions. Sir, I will turn the call back over to you for any closing comments.",Operator,4393961
,,,,
11984,Question-and-Answer,"Sure. Thank you very much. Thank you everyone for your support in Mesa over the years and certainly through the pandemic. It?s been obviously challenging. But on the same -- at the same time, we have worked very hard, keep all of our people moving in the same direction. They have been incredibly supportive.",Jonathan Ornstein,4393961
,,,,
11985,Question-and-Answer,"I have to tell you, I am every day amazed that the work effort that people are putting in, whether it?s out online in the maintenance hangers and dispatch or the people who are working from home diligently to keep the company moving forward.",Jonathan Ornstein,4393961
,,,,
11986,Question-and-Answer,"We think that the accomplishments this quarter certainly will bode well for the future. I think when we look at our two main partnerships with United and their support, your willingness to loan -- to prepay us $80-plus million to help us financially strengthen our balance sheet. I think is something and particularly given the environment remarkable in itself.",Jonathan Ornstein,4393961
,,,,
11987,Question-and-Answer,,Jonathan Ornstein,4393961
,,,,
11988,Question-and-Answer,"And we are really pleased with American and their support, and the work that Brad did putting that deal together that allowed us to continue to operate those 40 aircraft within the American system. Those two things, I think, will hopefully be indicative of what we are capable of doing going forward with those partners.",Jonathan Ornstein,4393961
,,,,
11989,Question-and-Answer,"Additionally, the U.S. Treasury Department loan has been giving us incredible flexibility with the aircraft. Our cash cost on the aircraft that were financed by the Treasury loan is about $11,000 a month and I think that it?s important that. While we have depreciation expense and obviously, engine expense, that flexibility is what allowed us to put the American deal together.",Jonathan Ornstein,4393961
,,,,
11990,Question-and-Answer,I am hopeful on the cargo side that we can continue to see opportunities there. I can tell you that we have had numerous inbound calls regarding our cargo capability over the last few months. We -- and we are looking forward to acting on those calls also going forward.,Jonathan Ornstein,4393961
,,,,
11991,Question-and-Answer,"All in all, we feel much better with what?s happening now on the world scene at the beginning of the distribution of the vaccine, which in itself may be a business opportunity for us and I think that our partners are continuing to show their confidence. In fact, one of our partners has indicated to us at the high level that they expect us to be running at almost 100% utilization by the end of the calendar year.",Jonathan Ornstein,4393961
,,,,
11992,Question-and-Answer,"So hopefully, as they say in every -- all the indications are in the green and we are continuing to make progress going forward. So thank you again. Always feel free to give us a call if you have any additional questions. Thank you, everybody.",Jonathan Ornstein,4393961
,,,,
11993,Question-and-Answer,And thank you. This concludes today?s conference call. You may go ahead and disconnect at this time.,Operator,4393961

,,,,
12003,Presentation,"We attribute the strong financial performance and robust combined shipments and purchase order backlog to the ongoing technical transition in our industry. Channel and video services proliferation, increasing global demand for high quality video anywhere anytime and specifically to the growing adoption of Evertz?s IP-based software defined video networking solutions, Evertz?s IT and virtualized cloud solutions, our immersive 4K ultra HD solutions and our state-of-the-art DreamCatcher IP replay and BRAVO live production suite.",Brian Campbell,4393959

,,,,
12022,Presentation,Brian back to you.,Doug Moore,4393959
,,,,
12023,Presentation,"Thank you, Doug. Brandon, we're now ready to open the call to questions.",Brian Campbell,4393959
,,,,
12024,Question-and-Answer,[Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Thanos Moschopoulos with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.,Operator,4393959
,,,,
12025,Question-and-Answer,"I realize you don't provide guidance, but what would be your thoughts, I guess, qualitatively in terms of how we should think about the near term revenue trajectory? Is it a situation where things are improving as far as customer spending behavior and your ability to implement or whether maybe some one-time factors that benefited Q2 which might make Q3 compared to [sales different] challenging?",Thanos Moschopoulos,4393959
,,,,
12026,Question-and-Answer,"So I'll break it down into - well I guess the - we did see good, strong revenue increases in all geographies, during Q2 and we also had numerous projects pushed ahead in the quarter. So we had very strong delivery results as well too. So, they're - definitely we're continuing to experience challenges getting onsite with customers and COVID shutdowns or lockdowns in various geographies.",Brian Campbell,4393959
,,,,
12027,Question-and-Answer,"We are working through it fairly well, as you can tell by the strong financial results. Q3 again to you know I can't forecast what the global environments going to look like in terms of our access to be able to get into multiple geographies. That said, we continue to do our utmost to provide, remote delivery, commissioning of the services and the solutions that our customers need for their business models to continue to grow and prosper.",Brian Campbell,4393959
,,,,
12028,Question-and-Answer,"So, we're looking at a very good solid shipments and backlog. You can see that the shipments are a little lower than the prior entry into Q2, but our backlog is solid.",Brian Campbell,4393959
,,,,
12029,Question-and-Answer,"So Brian I mean, the main variable we should think about maybe is just how this new wave of lockdowns may or may not affect implementation. Is that maybe more likely to have an impact on the upcoming quarter relative to - rather than the demand picture?",Thanos Moschopoulos,4393959
,,,,
12030,Question-and-Answer,That's not something I can forecast.,Brian Campbell,4393959
,,,,
12031,Question-and-Answer,Yes.,Thanos Moschopoulos,4393959
,,,,
12032,Question-and-Answer,"We?ll do our best to deliver throughout the quarter. So, what you have is a good solid shipments and backlog number that's right in line with our two year averages, even excluding prior to COVID. So we're sitting, well positioned entering into Q3 and, but we're still subject to the global environment for getting access to customer sites.",Brian Campbell,4393959
,,,,
12033,Question-and-Answer,"And again, we're doing our utmost to be able to deliver products and solutions remotely. But there's definitely a component of onsite commissioning and other activities that's required for our business.",Brian Campbell,4393959
,,,,
12034,Question-and-Answer,,Brian Campbell,4393959
,,,,
12035,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. Can you speak to how the pandemic might be altering customer spending priorities? One of the things we've heard is the - some customers are looking to accelerate their plans for cloud adoption. So just curious as to whether you're seeing that dynamic as well. And if that's the case, how might we think about sort of the impact over the coming quarters in terms of, how that could influence revenue margins if your cloud mix, does shift considerably versus hardware mix?",Thanos Moschopoulos,4393959
,,,,
12036,Question-and-Answer,"Doug, I?ll let you address the margin shift.",Brian Campbell,4393959
,,,,
12037,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, so I guess - you do kind of divert from the spending environment. But some of the cloud-based solutions are behind on the higher margin side. I mean, there is hardware components on the less. But a shift in such a nature will lead inherently to a slight uptick in margins.",Doug Moore,4393959
,,,,
12038,Question-and-Answer,"Again on the demand side as we've noted, much of our sales are driven by our new technology. So our SDVN solutions, our DreamCatcher and BRAVO, replay and live production and our cloud-based solutions. So we're already experiencing a strong component of the delivery of the type of products that our customers are increasingly adopting. So any changes in our customer spending behavior that you may see and reports align very well with our product suite that we've invested very heavily over the last years and have been deploying in numerous locations.",Brian Campbell,4393959
,,,,
12039,Question-and-Answer,"Okay, and certainly you have some good case studies, such as - the work you've done with Discovery and Warner among other's? Because ultimately, would you agree with the notion, though, that the pandemic specifically is accelerating cloud adoption? Does that make sense to you from what you're seeing?",Thanos Moschopoulos,4393959
,,,,
12040,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, it is and it's also accelerating IP infrastructure adoption well to.",Brian Campbell,4393959
,,,,
12041,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. And then finally from me, from an OpEx perspective, I guess the variable there might be whether and to what extent the stimulus repeats next quarter, but aside for that, should we expect OpEx to remain fairly consistent heading into Q3?",Thanos Moschopoulos,4393959
,,,,
12042,Question-and-Answer,"Yes so I think, first of all, you're correct and there is the variable there that you mentioned in the sense of the wage subsidies. Beyond that, there was also in the OpEx you'll see a one-time item associated with ITCs that we had a successful audit appeal associated with our shared claims that resulted in a bit of an uptick and the $2.5 million is kind of a one-time item that was help of the overall OpEx. And you'll see that and through the ITC component.",Doug Moore,4393959
,,,,
12043,Question-and-Answer,Thank you for the question. [Operator Instructions] The next question will come from Boyang Li with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.,Operator,4393959
,,,,
12044,Question-and-Answer,"Congrats on solid quarter, just kind of curious on the shipment numbers for November it is down compared to last quarter. And wondering if you kind of talk through why that is and maybe how it compared to what your expectations were for the month of November?",Boyang Li,4393959
,,,,
12045,Question-and-Answer,"So, the shipments are in line with the variability that we'll have, on any months on in a given period, so it's reasonably solid shipment level. And that together with our backlog as I said, we're right on the two-year average for total of shipments and backlog.",Brian Campbell,4393959
,,,,
12046,Question-and-Answer,"Okay, great. And then maybe switching gears here, can you maybe speak to your mix of revenue or orders by customer type, like either traditional broadcasters, production companies OTT vendors, as a result of the pandemic? Have you seen a shift in customer demand across these different customers?",Boyang Li,4393959
,,,,
12047,Question-and-Answer,"Our customer base has been fairly consistent. And so, we have the largest global broadcast media companies, new media companies as customers, the complexion of them changes at any given quarter. But we consistently have our top 10 saw the largest broadcast and new media companies in the world. So, we haven't seen any significant shifts - and that just normal changes in spending patterns.",Brian Campbell,4393959
,,,,
12048,Question-and-Answer,,Brian Campbell,4393959
,,,,
12049,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question will come from Robert Young with Canaccord. Please go ahead.,Operator,4393959

12050,Question-and-Answer,"I'm going to try the same question a third time, if you'll forgive me just on that shipment number for November at $23 million, that's down a lot year-over-year, as you noted. And so I just try to, square up the progression of the quarter, if it started at $36 million in August, and then to get to the quarter, you'd have to do 30 average both of the other two months. And then you drop to 23 which doesn't, as far as I remember just, it doesn't match normal seasonality?",Robert Young,4393959
,,,,
12051,Question-and-Answer,"And then in this year, you would have seen a resumption of sports, and you would have seen U.S. election activity. And so I guess the worry is, is that you would have seen some one-time items from those things that might have drawn - driven a higher than normal level of revenue, in the last quarter. And so, as we look forward into Q3, should we be thinking of that, as a quarter that down quarter-over-quarter or can we kind of think of $100 million, type of quarterly pace, as back to pre COVID levels back to normal?",Robert Young,4393959
,,,,
12052,Question-and-Answer,"So Rob again, to the shipments and backlog level, we are very good, solid robust numbers, our average. One of the things with a big election period like that as you've noted, what happens as well to - when you've got critical news. Customers networks enter into a lockdown phase where they're not deploying or altering their networks to ensure that there's no outages. So you do have to bear in mind that is a consequence of a new cycle as well to.",Brian Campbell,4393959
,,,,
12053,Question-and-Answer,"And so that, there are any benefit from that wouldn't have fallen in Q2 and would have fallen in Q1, perhaps because your customers would have lockdown is that what you're saying?",Robert Young,4393959
,,,,
12054,Question-and-Answer,"During the election period leading up to it and of course - as the new cycles progress through, there are periods of lockdown, yes.",Brian Campbell,4393959
,,,,
12055,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. And then the second sorry keep going, sorry Brian and that means kind of yes?",Robert Young,4393959
,,,,
12056,Question-and-Answer,So that does have an impact on the ability to deliver.,Brian Campbell,4393959
,,,,
12057,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, okay.",Robert Young,4393959
,,,,
12058,Question-and-Answer,For those prime customer.,Brian Campbell,4393959
,,,,
12059,Question-and-Answer,"That make sense, okay. I'm not sure if I caught it in the monologue right or not. But I think you said that the top customers 25%, I don't think I've seen a number that high. And as long as I remember and so any color you can provide around that that would be $25 million from one customer and in the quarter or something around that number. And so, is there any color you can provide there with the pent up demand on a delayed project that freed up or something like that, or did I just hear that number wrong?",Robert Young,4393959
,,,,
12060,Question-and-Answer,"No, you heard the number correctly. And that does happen from time-to-time where - a customer?s business plan and projects drop into one quarter more so. Oftentimes, it's spread out over several quarters, timing wise, that is a significant percentage of the quarter. It does tend to even out over or the year over multiple quarters.",Brian Campbell,4393959
,,,,
12061,Question-and-Answer,"But again, we're thrilled to have significant customers, have the confidence to deploy that level of infrastructure solutions with us in a challenging time like this in a quarter. So that bodes well for us.",Brian Campbell,4393959
,,,,
12062,Question-and-Answer,"And can we expect that one customer to continue spending that bad level, if we were to take that customer out obviously, it would be a $75 million quarters out of a $100 million quarter which jives a little closer with the $23 million first month shipment. And so, could that be a reason for the lower shipment number?",Robert Young,4393959
,,,,
12063,Question-and-Answer,"We have very good Tier 1 customers who require delivery over multiple quarters. So, I do not expect, anticipate to see levels persist at the 25% rate. What if - this is again to a significant customer of ours, a long-term customer.",Brian Campbell,4393959
,,,,
12064,Question-and-Answer,,Brian Campbell,4393959
,,,,
12065,Question-and-Answer,"Okay, great, that's really good color. Thank you. And then maybe one last question, just on the other questions on the trend towards cloud and maybe you touch a little bit on remote production. I know you've hit on this BRAVO product a few times. Maybe you talk about centralized production and remote production. And how Evertz has seen any benefit there, are you seen a big is that a driver in the market today and yes?",Robert Young,4393959
,,,,
12066,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, absolutely, the move to remote production is certainly a driver, our DreamCatcher IP-based replay and the BRAVO live production suite. So together, those are very innovative groundbreaking products. And you're going to see, more of them in the future. And some of the press releases, whether it's the previously [CBS DABL] or Discovery and their ability to be able to more easily spin up channels and do production, innovative productions.",Brian Campbell,4393959
,,,,
12067,Question-and-Answer,And that is a wave of the future. And most definitely our DreamCatcher and BRAVO live production suite fit squarely in there.,Brian Campbell,4393959
,,,,
12068,Question-and-Answer,"Okay, maybe this last question from me just on I mean, you're probably saving a lot of money right now not going to trade shows, which normally would be a normal course of your business. And so, I see you're doing a lot of virtual trade shows and marketing events. And so, maybe if you could just talk about, how that is changing the way you're thinking about your sales and marketing expense going forward?",Robert Young,4393959
,,,,
12069,Question-and-Answer,"Will you be leaning more on that less on trade shows? Are you seeing a, good competitive advantage relative to others, given that these big trade shows are shutdown, and then I'll pass the line?",Robert Young,4393959
,,,,
12070,Question-and-Answer,"So very good question. So - our sales team has done an outstanding job of maintaining communications with our customer base and with these interactive programs, we're able to let them help introduce new products show the use cases, and to continue to drive purchase orders and delivery of those innovative solutions to our customers. So it's absolutely been very beneficial to us.",Brian Campbell,4393959
,,,,
12071,Question-and-Answer,"But candidly, we all love to meet our customers face-to-face to show the products. And that's just not possible in today's environment. As the environment changes, we anticipate resuming face-to-face communications, but the lessons that we've learned during these challenging times won't be lost. And so, numerous folks appreciate the ability to be able to see our products and can communicate in a virtual environment, as well to supplement - our sales and marketing experiences.",Brian Campbell,4393959
,,,,
12072,Question-and-Answer,Thank you for the question. The next question will come from Steven Li with Raymond James. Please go ahead.,Operator,4393959
,,,,
12073,Question-and-Answer,"My question is on the gross margin during the pandemic. So the first two quarters this fiscal year is even stronger than last year, despite the lower revenues. How do you explain that?",Steven Li,4393959
,,,,
12074,Question-and-Answer,"I think to properly explain it, you have to include the notification that there is certain costs that have been subsidized so where as the wage subsidies - is designed to highlight there. I mean the biggest component where cost of sales includes during the year, a little over $5 million and wage subsidies that have been taken as a straight reduction to cost of sales. So, I think to properly analyze it you would have that back in a sense.",Brian Campbell,4393959
,,,,
12075,Question-and-Answer,"In the first quarter in fact, actually was with a decrease selling activity and efficiencies, I guess with the shutdowns the margins without that was actually quite weak. It's definitely in Q2, things have rebounded very strongly. But I do analyze it property, you need to look at both components.",Brian Campbell,4393959
,,,,
12076,Question-and-Answer,And so that's 5 million in the first half is it a similar amount in the second half for subsidies or is it going to be a much lower number?,Steven Li,4393959
,,,,
12077,Question-and-Answer,"No, no, no it will be much lower. So we - there is a variety of different global programs, but yes, the expectation is, it's really even from Q1 to Q2, it's been cut in half really. And then it's going to be further, maybe a third next time. It's really - the actual amount difficult to forecast as its dependent on actual sales and other such calculations, but no, it will be dropping significantly.",Brian Campbell,4393959
,,,,
12078,Question-and-Answer,,Brian Campbell,4393959
,,,,
12079,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you. [Operator Instructions] I'm showing no further questions at this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Brian Campbell for closing remarks.",Operator,4393959

12080,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you, Brandon. I'd like to thank the participants for the questions and add that we're very pleased with the company's performance during the second quarter of fiscal 2021, which is our quarterly sales rebound to $100.5 million. Solid gross margins of 59.4% in the quarter, delivering pretax earnings of $28.1 million, all while investing nearly $20 million in R&D to build future growth.",Brian Campbell,4393959
,,,,
12081,Question-and-Answer,"We're entering the second half of fiscal 2021 with significant momentum, fueled by a combined purchase order backlog plus November shipments totaling in excess of $136 million. By the growing adoption and successful large scale deployments of Evertz?s IP-based software defined video networking, and virtualized cloud solutions by some of the largest broadcast new media, service provider and enterprise companies in the industry.",Brian Campbell,4393959

This compares with revenues of $7.7 million in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2019.

,,,,
12096,Presentation,"Gross profit was $7.6 million or 54% of revenue. The increase in gross profit margin compared to last year was largely due to the additional leverage of fixed overhead costs gained on the higher revenues.

The non-cash benefit and higher revenue generated net income of $9.5 million or $0.27 per diluted share in the fiscal fourth quarter.

12104,Presentation,"Thank you, Dennis and good afternoon to everybody on the call. Genasys had a great FY 2020. Record fiscal fourth quarter and second half revenues powered the company to meet the fiscal year 2020 pre-pandemic outlook we provided on our December 2019 conference call.

,,,,
12107,Presentation,"We expect to return to bookings growth, as they move ahead with planned emergency warning initiatives. As evidence, we expect record fiscal 2021 first quarter bookings that will put us on track for a record fiscal 2021 revenues.

,,,,
12110,Presentation,The powerful geolocation capability of NEWS also provides authorities confirmation whether each mobile phone user received a potential life saving alerts and information. Our Australia emergency alerting awards are strategically important to Genasys because of the June 2022 European Union National Public Warning System Directive. The EU Article 110 Directive mandates that every EU Member State implement a public warning system that can send emergency alerts to the mobile phones of residents and visitors in case of disasters or other critical events.,Richard Danforth,4393958
,,,,
12111,Presentation,"The system must include geo-targeted emergency communication, and be able to notify residents and visitors of emergencies without having to opt-in. There are between two and five mobile carriers per each EU Member State, all of which will be required to deploy a software platform similar to NEWS that features SMS, cell broadcast, or a combination of both to comply with the mandate.",Richard Danforth,4393958

Based on the June 2022 deadline and previous guidance from the EU, we anticipate the member states would begin announcing awards in mid-calendar 2021.",Richard Danforth,4393958
,,,,
12113,Presentation,"While we expect the EU awards will push towards the end of calendar 2021, activities throughout the EU continues at a rapid pace.

We expect this customer base to expand throughout fiscal year 2021. The enterprise software market in the United States and Canada has grown significantly over the last five years. Because the installed base is relatively new and software licenses are typically sold in a one, three, or five year term, Genasys is in a strong position to now compete for and win first time contracts and replace license renewals with our enterprise solution.",Richard Danforth,4393958

,,,,
12124,Question-and-Answer,"Great, thanks. Congratulations on the great year and quarter. You know, you mentioned you're hiring more enterprise sales people, you know, what's the timeframe for that? And then, how long do you expect ? how long do you expect the take for them to become sort of fully productive?",Mike Latimore,4393958
,,,,
12125,Question-and-Answer,"We began a hiring process, Mike, almost immediately after we completed the acquisition of Amika Mobile on October 2. So, we have hired two full time sales people. We have outstanding offers to two additional, and are looking to put six more on, I expect that they'll all be on between probably by our second ? end of our second quarter.",Richard Danforth,4393958
,,,,
12126,Question-and-Answer,"And then for them to ramp up the full productivity, what are you assuming there?",Mike Latimore,4393958
,,,,
12127,Question-and-Answer,"It depends on the individual and the geography. But as you know, it's not going to be immediate, but I expect certainly by the third and fourth quarter that will ramp up fairly steeply.",Richard Danforth,4393958
,,,,
12128,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. Great. And then you mentioned the [pilot] in Europe, are you the only one sort of doing a pilot in this specific country?",Mike Latimore,4393958

,,,,
12131,Question-and-Answer,"Our bookings for 2021 are expected to be substantially higher than that which is in ? we experienced in FY 2020. That's across the board in our integrated systems, our LRADs and our enterprise software solutions. In terms of visibility, it's quite good. The sales cycle for systems and programmed LRAD acquisitions is quite long. So, we got good visibility into the pipeline that which is in our forecast as well.",Richard Danforth,4393958

,,,,
12137,Question-and-Answer,"Not exactly. I said, I expect record bookings in fiscal Q1 of FY 2021. And I do expect yet again, record revenues for our fiscal 2021.

,,,,
12139,Question-and-Answer,"All right, great. And then you know, obviously, you guys have done a very good job of growing revenue at a pretty healthy rate. You guys move into your, you know, new offices last year, what are the opportunity for, you know, much more margin improvement, as you guys, you know, are able to grow revenue at such a high pace?",Ed Woo,4393958
,,,,
12140,Question-and-Answer,"While we did ? I?ll let Dennis comment on that, but I think we?ve hit record gross margins in fourth quarter, but go ahead Dennis.",Richard Danforth,4393958
,,,,
12141,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. In the fourth quarter we had 54% gross margin. For the total year is 52.6%. 54% is quite an improvement over ? where we've been over the last couple of years. We've achieved a 54% over both ? each of the last two quarters. So, obviously that ? with the increased revenue that's been a big driver in that margin growth. The software business, as you look down the road, you know, over the last couple years, it's ? we've added to the software business, but it's not yet a significant part of the total company revenue. It's probably 5% or less of total company revenue. And, but as that grows in as a percentage of the total revenue, you would expect that the margins would increase somewhat.",Dennis Klahn,4393958
,,,,
12142,Question-and-Answer,"Right. And then the last question I have is, you know, you mentioned that you guys were still pursuing M&A opportunity. You know, congratulations on closing the Amika deal. Are you pretty much fully integrated for Amika? And also, in terms of M&A deals, are you going to continue to look for smaller Genasys Amika type size deals or the ? think you guys are potentially, you know, looking for a much bigger acquisition?",Ed Woo,4393958
,,,,
12143,Question-and-Answer,"The integration of Amika mobile with the Genasys Enterprise Solution is ongoing and we?ll continue over the next couple of quarters, Ed. In terms of acquisition candidates, we?re not particularly constrained in size, although the two we have bought have been of the smaller variety. But no, it's not a particular focus on small versus large, its capabilities, and what the acquisition can help improve from a shareholder value perspective.",Richard Danforth,4393958
,,,,
12144,Question-and-Answer,"Great. Well, thank you for answering my questions. And I wish you guys good luck. Thank you.",Ed Woo,4393958
,,,,
12145,Question-and-Answer,Thank you.,Richard Danforth ,4393958
,,,,
12146,Question-and-Answer,We?ll go next to Ryan MacWilliams at Stephens.,Operator,4393958
,,,,
12147,Question-and-Answer,"Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the results. Really nice to hear about the incremental demand you're seeing for emergency notification solutions as these corporates and municipalities are planning to go back to work. Are there any particular used cases that they're asking Genasys about that you can solve? And do you think there's a difference between, if corporates or municipalities will move first to add yourself or solutions?",Ryan MacWilliams,4393958
,,,,
12148,Question-and-Answer,"I think Ryan, both whether it's a municipality, a government, or a business, it's all about giving the employees and the management confidence that if there's a fence occurring that could harm them that they get notified as quickly as possible and necessary actions are taken as quickly as possible. So, the used cases are just that. It's about critical communications and getting ? knowing where people are and if they might be in harm?s way and what action those people should be taking.",Richard Danforth,4393958
,,,,
12149,Question-and-Answer,"Perfect. And just on the public warning opportunity. Would it make sense to acquire a cell broadcast provider to add maybe some country examples or existing country examples for cell broadcasts or maybe some additional cell broadcast capabilities? And then separately, do you think there's an opportunity for Genasys to sell its hardware solutions on top of your software capabilities to the European countries as a part of this public warning opportunity? ",Ryan MacWilliams,4393958
,,,,
12150,Question-and-Answer,"The second question first, and the answer is yes. As I mentioned, the pilot we're doing includes both cell broadcasts, location based SMS, and acoustic device integration. If your first question was, what ? do we want to think about buying a cell company or what was it?",Richard Danforth,4393958
,,,,
12151,Question-and-Answer,,Richard Danforth,4393958
,,,,
12152,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah, cell broadcast provider to add additional country examples for cell broadcasts or any capabilities.",Ryan MacWilliams,4393958
,,,,
12153,Question-and-Answer,"At this time I say no to that. We have our own integrated platform that has cell broadcast and location based SMS. As you know, would likely work with, you know, a hardware provider that would provide all the horsepower necessary to run the software? And those are pretty available Ryan.",Richard Danforth,4393958
,,,,
12154,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. You have the capabilities of your platform already. Just to that point, do you think the country is going forward as a result of COVID will trend more towards [hybrid solutions] in Europe or is it really still on a case by case basis at this point?",Ryan MacWilliams,4393958
,,,,
12155,Question-and-Answer,"I think more and more looking at the hybrid solution. It was a mix of cell broadcast versus location based SMS. The attributes of the location based SMS and knowing where the phones are and how many phones, what might be in an area that they need to be notified of a pending emergency. That functionality is provided by the location based SMS. It's not in the cell broadcast. So, knowing where the phones are, how many and how they're moving, I think has proven to be quite a versatile and valuable tool for emergency management people.",Richard Danforth,4393958
,,,,
12156,Question-and-Answer,"Perfect. Yeah, that's my understanding. There's not too many providers that can do both, but congrats on the quarter again. Thanks for taking the questions.",Ryan MacWilliams,4393958
,,,,
12157,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you, Ryan.",Richard Danforth,4393958

12158,Question-and-Answer,[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Rick Neaton at Rivershore Investments.,Operator,4393958
,,,,
12159,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you. Good afternoon, guys and congratulations on a record year. First question was, last year you suggested that revenues would be allocated about 40% in the first half 60% in the second half, by your comments about how revenue growth will occur this year in fiscal 2021, is that how we should look at it?",Rick Neaton,4393958
,,,,
12160,Question-and-Answer,Yes.,Richard Danforth,4393958
,,,,
12161,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. And looking at your higher OpEx in the fourth quarter of 4.5 million, is that going to be kind of a baseline going forward as you expand your sales force and integrated Amika?",Rick Neaton,4393958
,,,,
12162,Question-and-Answer,"It?ll probably be a little bit higher than that. Amika has its own base. So, that's going to be accretive. In addition, as we've noted, we're looking to substantially increase our sales force worldwide. We're looking at hiring 10, just to support the enterprise software. The Amika acquisition, plus we're looking to expand our worldwide sales force and to continue to support the EU initiative. So, I would expect to see that it will increase in 2021.",Dennis Klahn,4393958
,,,,
12163,Question-and-Answer,One last question. How's the visibility on the ? right now on the federal level military contracts and some of the government contracts looking forward into fiscal year 2021?,Rick Neaton,4393958
,,,,
12164,Question-and-Answer,"It's still a bit murky. As you're well aware Rick, the country is still in the midst of a continuing resolution with no fiscal year 2021 budgets passed. The current CR expires Friday, the 11th of December. It's likely they'll pass a one-week extension to that. From a perspective of Genasys, we're obviously very interested in the Defense Appropriations Bill. That bill has passed Congress, they?ve voted on it from the house side. Senate hasn't, but is expected to shortly.",Richard Danforth,4393958
,,,,
12165,Question-and-Answer,"There's a scenario that all 12 Appropriations Bill, as well as a COVID relief package will be put together in an [Omnibus] and submitted to the President next week. We shall see though. I mean, there's still a lot of things that have to happen. But it is ? there?s general bipartisan support for the defense bill. So there are, you know, political issues that always get in the way, but we've got a chance that this will make it certainly before the end of the calendar year.",Richard Danforth,4393958
,,,,
12166,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. So it's more of a timing issue. You view it as more of a timing issue then of visibility, your actual performance issue at this point?",Rick Neaton,4393958
,,,,
12167,Question-and-Answer,,Rick Neaton,4393958
,,,,
12168,Question-and-Answer,Yes.,Richard Danforth,4393958

,,,,
12173,Question-and-Answer,"Hi there, Lloyd.",Richard Danforth ,4393958
,,,,
12174,Question-and-Answer,"Hello. Yeah. Hi. Waited a long time for a quarter like this. Thank you and your whole team, really exciting. Thank you again. A couple there, you know, just on Australia, I know, we had one contract and this time we want two, but there was a third contract. Is there any word on that?",Lloyd Korten,4393958
,,,,
12175,Question-and-Answer,There's been no announcement on the third Australian carrier.,Richard Danforth,4393958
,,,,
12176,Question-and-Answer,"Oh, good. Okay. So we haven't lost that. We might get a hat-trick there. Are you feeling any headwinds in the States because of the financial constrictions that they're all under right now?",Lloyd Korten,4393958
,,,,
12177,Question-and-Answer,"We certainly have in our fiscal year 2021. 2021 was filled with people not working and then partially working, and then figuring out how to work remotely. Tax revenues from most communities will be down across the country in the world. So, that will put some pressure on it, no doubt. I will, however, say, Lloyd that in today's environment, whether it's the pandemic, whether it's terrorism, whether it's natural disasters, it's unlikely, in my opinion that a community or a government or a business is going to say, we're going to cancel our safety systems for our citizens our employees. That could happen. But I think what's more likely than not that they will continue down the course.",Richard Danforth,4393958
,,,,
12178,Question-and-Answer,"I?m just more interested in new. You know, cities, states that have not implemented it yet, whether it's going to be a burden for them to spend that money that they don't have right now. That was my question.",Lloyd Korten,4393958
,,,,
12179,Question-and-Answer,It'll be a challenge.,Richard Danforth,4393958
,,,,
12180,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. Anyway, listen, that was ? everything else has been answered. And thank you again.",Lloyd Korten,4393958

,,,,
12184,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you. Hi, guys. How you doing? Three questions. First of all, can you comment on backlogs at this time? Number one. Number two?",Unidentified Analyst,4393958
,,,,
12185,Question-and-Answer,"Backlog going in at 2021 is down the difference of the bookings and the revenue. So, the bookings as I mentioned were 36 million and the revenue was 43. So, $7 million.",Richard Danforth,4393958
,,,,
12186,Question-and-Answer,"Okay, got it. And the status of your stock buyback program?",Unidentified Analyst,4393958
,,,,
12187,Question-and-Answer,"That expires at the end of this year. This year we purchased about $400,000 worth of stock in the second quarter that the board will be looking at that and we'll see what the future holds. ",Dennis Klahn,4393958
,,,,
12188,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. Finally, do you see any emerging competitor, single competitor that you're running up against? I don't know how price sensitive your sale is, but with a weaker dollar overseas is that going to be of any import to you?",Unidentified Analyst,4393958
,,,,
12189,Question-and-Answer,"Well, we deal with the FX all around the world. In terms of competitors for the ? the LRAD product, we have become the de facto standard. We don't frequently run into a competition here in the United States or outside the United States. From an Enterprise Software Solution provider here in North America, there's a fair amount of competition with some very large companies, as well as some very small companies.",Richard Danforth,4393958
,,,,
12190,Question-and-Answer,"In terms of our integrated systems, like we're sold in Puerto Rico, and Laguna Beach, an integrated hardware software solution, I believe we?re the only ones that have that integrated solution. So, there will be competition, but it would have to be a consortium of companies that would compete against Genasys that has a single solution. And in terms of the National Emergency Warning Systems like Australia, like the requirements in the European Union there will be competition for both the location based SMS and the cell broadcast, but I think the heritage of Genasys and its abilities to ? they actually if you look back far enough, they were a pioneer in location based SMS services. We have decade's worth of experience in that area. And I like our chances as we move into the EU.",Richard Danforth,4393958

Even as the pandemic persist the digital transformation of the global financial services industry is only accelerating. Our customer conversations this quarter, the increasing interest we have seen from potential customers across the globe, and the pace at which many projects are moving forward or reinforce our excitement about the digital future of banking.",Pierre Naude,4393956
,,,,
12206,Presentation,"The new normal of remote work has made a digital strategy more than just a luxury for a financial institution. It's an imperative to manage day to day operations. nCino's cloud banking platform help reduce costs, increase revenues, improve employee efficiency and productivity while enhancing transparency and compliance. All critically important in a digital world. Our third quarter results reflect that we are helping customers respond to this digital reality.",Pierre Naude,4393956

12207,Presentation,,Pierre Naude,4393956
,,,,
12208,Presentation,"We are very pleased to have posted strong results for the quarter, again exceeding expectations and we are increasing our full year guidance. Subscription revenues increased 56% year-over-year, while total revenues grew 43%. Professional services revenues were also strong, mainly due to the accelerated deployment of a few large projects. The third quarter was also highlighted by the rollout of numerous product innovations across the nCino bank operating system as part of our full release.",Pierre Naude,4393956
,,,,
12209,Presentation,"We added new logos from financial institutions around the globe, ranging from an international challenger bank to an over $50 billion U.S. Bank, while taking customers lives in multiple countries.",Pierre Naude,4393956
,,,,
12210,Presentation,"Let's start by discussing our product updates in the fall release. As a reminder, nCino operates one code base across the platform, and we typically roll out major product improvements each spring and fall with incremental enhancements more frequently. So a $1 billion community bank is leveraging the same technology as the largest global banks in our installed base. This is part of our secret sauce. Customers can configure their solution to reflect the specific requirements of their institution while nCino leverages the cost benefit of maintaining a single codebase.",Pierre Naude,4393956
,,,,
12211,Presentation,"While I said we rolled out numerous product updates, the changes to nCino IQ, nIQ, our analytics platform are far more than an update. With the fall 2020 release nIQ's for the first time integrated into the bank operating system. Using artificial intelligence, data analytics and machine learning, nIQ allows financial institutions to leverage data and make more informed decisions in real time. We believe nIQ is a truly unique and unmatched offering. Our plan is to launch a series of solutions on the nIQ platform over time, integrated into the bank operating system.",Pierre Naude,4393956
,,,,
12212,Presentation,"One of our first nIQ solutions, Automated Spreading is targeted at our commercial banking customers. We have seen instances where automated spreading has reduced the manual requirements of loan underwriting by 50% to 75%, significantly increasing efficiency for financial institutions and accelerating the time to loan approval. We already have multiple institutions that have purchased automated spreading, all existing nCino customers that happened to be based outside the U.S., which is exciting as we continue our international growth.",Pierre Naude,4393956
,,,,
12213,Presentation,"One customer that purchased and has already gone live on automated spreading is $398 billion UK arm of a global bank, and another is an emerging challenger bank in Australia. For a current customer that utilizes nCino's spreading functionality, it can take as little as a few days to a couple of weeks to implement automated spreading. The time to revenue with orders spreading is significantly faster than our core products, where full deployment can range from six to nine months for a community or regional bank, and 12 to 24 months for a global enterprise bank.",Pierre Naude,4393956
,,,,
12214,Presentation,"Another nIQ product is portfolio analytics, which helps financial institutions better understand their portfolios, the payment history of their customers and what they can expect in the future. With portfolio analytics integrated into the bank operating system we expect to be able to more aggressively cross sell this functionality into our legacy customer base, as we did with a $1.6 billion community bank in the third quarter. While additional revenues from nIQ may not be material in the near-term, we see nIQ as further differentiating nCino, helping to increase our close rates and expand our competitive moat, as we lead the digitization of financial institutions of all sizes globally.",Pierre Naude,4393956
,,,,
12215,Presentation,"In addition to these nIQ solutions, in October, we also introduced enhancements to our collateral management functionality, specifically targeted to drive further adoption of our commercial lending solution in EMEA and APAC. Commercial lending customers will also benefit from the emphasis on increasing the ease of use, especially around loan modifications, and expanding portfolio management capabilities.",Pierre Naude,4393956

12217,Presentation,"Our product updates for retail banking, focused on increasing the depth and breadth of our retail solution. These updates take us a step closer to realizing our unique vision for retail banking, a low touch, no touch solution that makes consumer banking easy and seamless for bank employees and their clients.",Pierre Naude,4393956
,,,,
12218,Presentation,"We are pleased with our continued traction in the retail segment. We signed new customers for our deposit account opening solution and we also expanded a successful retail customer, a top 100 bank in the Midwest to commercial lending, a good example of our land and expand model.",Pierre Naude,4393956
,,,,
12219,Presentation,"Our product roadmap highlights how the different teams within nCino are so closely aligned and all centered around our customers. To highlight others flywheel works, let's quickly look at our product development process. Our customer success teams lead the way, leveraging their close relationships with customers to understand the pain points and inefficiencies in their bay. This feedback helps directly inform our product roadmap.",Pierre Naude,4393956
,,,,
12220,Presentation,"In fact, the need for an automated spreading solution was established in response to customers sharing the frustration of manually inputting data, often multiple times for the same loan. Many of these customers become early adopters and provide valuable feedback as we tweak and perfect the product, making it ready for general availability. At that point, the smallest community or regional bank to a global enterprise bank can leverage our technology to increase the efficiency of their business, grow revenues and help ensure the regulatory compliance of their institution.",Pierre Naude,4393956
,,,,
12221,Presentation,"This customer centric approach and deep understanding of our customers business not only drives our land and expand model, but also let us configure seat deployments as their business evolves, thus helping to minimize churn. In fact, we are already seeing this play out with selected PPP customers, where we have helped them develop a strategy to redeploy PPP seeds when the forgiveness program is completed. And of course, product innovation drives new customer wins.",Pierre Naude,4393956
,,,,
12222,Presentation,"In the third quarter, a top 50 U.S. bank purchased our customer engagement solution and will leverage our industry expertise to achieve a very efficient deployment schedule. Earlier in the quarter, we announced that Texas Farm Credit was live on our platform. More recently, we added another customer in the agriculture lending space, expanding our market share in this niche segment.",Pierre Naude,4393956
,,,,
12223,Presentation,"The platform configurability, I noted earlier, is key to addressing the unique lending requirements of this market with $365 billion in assets. While we continue to grow our customer base in ag lending, we look for similar opportunities in other industries.",Pierre Naude,4393956
,,,,
12224,Presentation,"In Australia, Judo Bank, the country's first fully accredited challenger bank, is building its infrastructure on nCino, and will use our commercial lending system to service its small and medium sized enterprise clients. Finally, 15 customers purchased additional PPP seeds to service their forgiveness customers, including a top 10 and a top 25 U.S. bank.",Pierre Naude,4393956
,,,,
12225,Presentation,"As we discussed on our last earnings call, customer go lives are an important milestone for nCino and a key way we measure our success. Having a customer live in production and experiencing the benefits of our software is the first step in getting the next win with that customer. Again, everything at nCino goes back to our customers and our success is directly linked to this, which is why customer testimonials and feedback are so powerful.",Pierre Naude,4393956
,,,,
12226,Presentation,"For instance, Jeff Schweitzer, the President and CEO of Univest Financial Corporation, a long time nCino customer based in Pennsylvania, was recently quoted as saying, ""we just got a report, that the loans that we are doing with nCino have lowered the amount of time that it would normally take us to complete the transaction by 60%. So that has created incredible efficiency for us. It allows the customer to get whatever funding they are looking for quicker, while allowing us to continue to leverage technology and grow without having to add more physical bodies to our team.""",Pierre Naude,4393956

,,,,
12229,Presentation,"Back to the Go-Live. In the third quarter, two financial institutions in Canada went live on commercial lending, one, a top 10 credit union and the other a top six bank. We expanded on the Ag lending business, I discussed earlier by taking another leading Ag Lending back live, one of our largest global customers with nCino deployments in multiple countries went live with the commercial lending and its top 50 U.S. bank.",Pierre Naude,4393956

12232,Presentation,"During the quarter, we are pleased to announce details about our relationships with a number of banks around the globe. Understandably, for competitive reasons, financial institutions often won't let us discuss our partnerships. So, we are particularly excited to announce in the third quarter that Barclays adopted the nCino bank operating system to streamline various onboarding processes. The comment from Paul Compton, the global head of banking at Barclays and Co-President of Barclays Bank PLC in October, was very exciting to hear, and I quote.",Pierre Naude,4393956

Subscription revenues for this quarter were $43.3 million, an increase of 56% year-over-year, representing 80% of total revenues in the third quarter. Subscription revenues benefited from approximately $1 million in catch up revenues related to a PPP consortium that utilize our software to process PPP loans.

12241,Presentation,"As a reminder, revenues from PPP customers is recognized immediately. Unlike our core bank operating system customers, which generally activate over a defined period depending on the contract terms.

,,,,
12258,Presentation,"In summary, we are very pleased with the continued momentum in the third quarter as we continue to benefit from PPP related revenues along with increased professional services activity, as customers are anxious to get their programs live. We are encouraged that customers are refocusing on their core business, especially the larger enterprise banks. I don't think anyone would say we're back to normal, but we believe the trend is definitely improving, which is reflected in our increased full year guidance, which at the midpoint represents 45% annual total revenue growth and 56% annual subscription revenue growth.",David Rudow,4393956

12260,Presentation,Now we will open the call to questions.,David Rudow,4393956
,,,,
12261,Question-and-Answer,[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Saket Kalia with Barclays. You may proceed with your question.,Operator,4393956
,,,,
12262,Question-and-Answer,"Okay, great. Hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions here and some great customer examples there in the prepared commentary.",Saket Kalia,4393956
,,,,
12263,Question-and-Answer,"Saket, how are you? Good to hear from you.",Pierre Naude,4393956
,,,,
12264,Question-and-Answer,"Hey, good, Pierre. Good to hear from you as well. Maybe first for Pierre. Can you just talk about what you're hearing from customers that use your tools for the Paycheck Protection Program? And maybe just as importantly, how they're thinking about those tools going into next year, when knock on wood, those seats won't be used for PPP or forgiveness?",Saket Kalia,4393956
,,,,
12265,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, very good question. So that, most of these customers, this was really, I think, accelerates the understanding for the need for the digital tools. And so what we are doing is working with many of them to expand the offering for digital lending across to other portfolio elements.",Pierre Naude,4393956
,,,,
12266,Question-and-Answer,"But firstly, we are leaving those solutions in place, because there is an anticipation of a follow on around the PPP, and we'll have to see what happens there. But as soon as we know that we'll either use the seats for the next round of PPP that comes to fruition, and if not, we have plans with our clients to redeploy that to expand it to other products inside the bank.",Pierre Naude,4393956
,,,,
12267,Question-and-Answer,"Got it, that's really helpful. My follow-up for you, David. Maybe related to services revenue. It was good to see the acceleration here. I guess, I'm curious, do you have any anecdotes or data points on whether services revenue tends to lead or lag subscription revenue or just generally anything we can glean on the subscription part of the business from this quarter services result?",Saket Kalia,4393956
,,,,
12268,Question-and-Answer,,Saket Kalia,4393956
,,,,
12269,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, I don't think there's any, I don't think you can glean anything to subscription. Because remember, the majority of our projects are deployed by our partners. And you don't have visibility into that. We had a very strong results performance in Europe, with the services team, and then also the Americas. So we expect that will continue, as we show the prior guidance for the fourth quarter as well.",David Rudow,4393956
,,,,
12270,Question-and-Answer,"We do have seasonality to remember for the fourth quarter, just normal seasonality, we have people going on PTO, we have the holidays to deal with. And so we do expect that we'll be sequentially down as we look at the fourth quarter.",David Rudow,4393956
,,,,
12271,Question-and-Answer,"Got it. Very helpful. I'll hop back in queue. Thanks, guys.",Saket Kalia,4393956
,,,,
12272,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. Good to hear from you.,Pierre Naude,4393956
,,,,
12273,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Sills with Bank of America Securities. You may proceed with your question.,Operator,4393956
,,,,
12274,Question-and-Answer,"Great. Hey, thanks, guys. I wanted to ask a question on international, it sounds like you're seeing some real traction there in the services business. Would that translate into subscription as well? And just any commentary on some of the investments you've been making there, and how those are playing out?",Brad Sills,4393956
,,,,
12275,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, Brad. Good to hear from you. Let me make an overall comment and then David you can take the more detailed ones. As I mentioned, throughout this we got to know all of you that the frustration this year is, we cannot travel to Europe because of COVID then actually go and hire people and drive momentum into the market. However, even under these circumstances, we are seeing great traction, we've hired people locally into countries now in Europe. As you know, our main office is in London. We are also seeing very good interest in our pipelines across the European continent.",Pierre Naude,4393956
,,,,
12276,Question-and-Answer,"So I am actually very optimistic that the investments we are making are beginning to pay off. And the same problems that was here five years ago, and how we penetrate the market, we're seeing exactly the same problems over there. And we see the beginning of that momentum coming. As you know, we've got good traction in the UK and Ireland, and I'm beginning to see that same signals across the bond in Europe.",Pierre Naude,4393956
,,,,
12277,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. Brad, how you doing? We had a really good quarter internationally 98% growth 12% of total revenues. The services team performed very well in EMEA. Asia Pacific was a good quarter. And we are continuing to invest in our PSO teams in EMEA, and APAC and then also on the support side and international and EMEA as well. So it so far it looks good. COVID has -- I think it's that all the lockdowns that we're seeing it really hasn't had a major impact on the deployments on the services side. So we're very pleased with what we saw from the team in the third quarter.",David Rudow,4393956
,,,,
12278,Question-and-Answer,"That's great. Thanks, David. Thanks, Pierre. And then one more if I may just on nIQ some good traction here. It sounds like automated spreading solution in one of the big banks, should we expect more deals like that where nIQ is being deployed for a specific use case? I know it's being implemented across or embedded if you will, across all the different modules within nCino.",Brad Sills,4393956
,,,,
12279,Question-and-Answer,"But is it more use case driven? Are you seeing customers in the pipeline for nIQ looking at nIQ more pervasively throughout the organization? How should we think about that? Thanks, guys.",Brad Sills,4393956
,,,,
12280,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. So I see two main benefits with nIQ. The first one is it's going to differentiate us further from the competition. And also sometimes we are competing with home build or people who want to build any house, which is becoming less and less. But the more intelligent in automation we drive into these systems, the more difficult it will be for the bank to compete with the IT departments, as well as it will diminish the competition on the point solutions. Because how do you string all these things together to give your employees and your customers a cohesive experience?",Pierre Naude,4393956
,,,,
12281,Question-and-Answer,,Pierre Naude,4393956
,,,,
12282,Question-and-Answer,"As you look at those nIQ examples, I'm very excited about for instance, when we bought Visible Equity, they were focused mostly on the small credit unions. And now we have signed up a nice community bank that is much bigger than the typical credit union service on the portfolio analytics. Then you look at what we said in the press release around two large banks, taking the automated spreading solution. In one case, it was an existing customer often suite when we acquired them. In other case it's an nCino customer using our spreads.",Pierre Naude,4393956
,,,,
12283,Question-and-Answer,"Over time, that solution is going to help us to penetrate the spreading department or underwriting department of a bank much deeper, because it really drive that level of efficiency, number one. And number two, it will differentiate us further in the market as the market either on the commercial loan origination.",Pierre Naude,4393956
,,,,
12284,Question-and-Answer,"So I'm just exciting overall on the trends I'm seeing there. And as we mentioned earlier, those products from implementation tend to revenue is much faster than traditional seed deployment of the big transformation projects.",Pierre Naude,4393956
,,,,
12285,Question-and-Answer,"That's great. Thanks so much, Pierre.",Brad Sills,4393956
,,,,
12286,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. Our next question comes from Terry Tillman with Truist. You may proceed with your question.,Operator,4393956
,,,,
12287,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, thanks for taking my questions. And congratulations on the strong results. Hi, Pierre, David and Greg. I guess my first question just relates maybe, Peter, for you, or Pierre for you on the retail banking side. Just maybe an update on where you are in terms of the size and scale of that business? And with the pandemic, does that potentially accelerate the roadmap and adoption by bigger enterprise or global banks? And then I had a follow up. Thank you.",Terry Tillman,4393956
,,,,
12288,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, as we look at retail in general, let me just describe what retail is again. So it?s a reminder. Firstly, there is a retail lending solution. There's also a deposit account opening solution that includes checking savings, money markets, HELOCs et cetera and then there's the onboarding solution. So that three combined makes up that and then you've got international mortgage that comes in there.",Pierre Naude,4393956
,,,,
12289,Question-and-Answer,"And on all those fronts, we are seeing great momentum. But as you know, the retail product suite is much more regulated than what the commercial side is. And as such, we just had a great release coming out in October, where we further refined our HMDA and TRID [ph] solutions, as well as our doc prep solutions, which these are very complex things. The regulations and requirements may vary by county and by zip code, okay. And as we mature that to actually work across the U.S., I'm beginning to see great interest.",Pierre Naude,4393956
,,,,
12290,Question-and-Answer,"See, there's a notion today in banking, that the retail solutions are working good enough. And what we're beginning to prove through configuration, automation, and a low touch to no touch experience is that we can move the needle here for banks to make it a lot more productive, and improve the customer experience. And through that we are beginning to see the early signs of momentum.",Pierre Naude,4393956
,,,,
12291,Question-and-Answer,"I frankly speak quite a lot with our Head of Sales in those markets and asked him about it. And every time I ask him, he says Pierre, there's a good pipeline, and there's great interest. And we think that thing is coming along. Then in April we have another release. And every time we do that, we mature that thing and we automate all the processes more. So I've got very optimistic view of the retail solutions.",Pierre Naude,4393956
,,,,
12292,Question-and-Answer,"And I guess David, maybe just a question and it's more just to kind of for memory sake, because I may have forgotten. But did you all talk about kind of the updated full year FY '21 contribution from PPP programs, whether it was program or forgiveness and any change to that? And can you remind us again what the redeployment rate you see going into next year? And again, congrats.",Terry Tillman,4393956
,,,,
12293,Question-and-Answer,,Terry Tillman,4393956
,,,,
12294,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, thank you. Thank you, Terry. So for the third quarter, PPP contributed about $5 million to the number and that includes the $1 million catch up from the consortium. And for the year now, we expect $13 million and that's up from $10 million that we talked about on the second quarter. And in terms of seeds being redeployed, I think it's too early. There was a handful of customers that we redeployed elsewhere into their orgs, but it's just too early right now. The sales teams out there talking to customers, making sure that when they are up and need to be redeployed, that they'll be a home for them. So, so far, so good.",David Rudow,4393956
,,,,
12295,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Beck with KeyBanc. You may proceed with your question.,Operator,4393956
,,,,
12296,Question-and-Answer,"Thanks for taking the question, team. Good to hear from you. Pierre, I maybe just wanted to start with you. Certainly the tenor I think of the bank executives seems to have really improved in the last 90 days. I think the loss rates that the banks had forecast, things are actually coming in a little bit better. So you'd mentioned this notion that they're starting to refocus on their core operations. So I'm just kind of curious, are they pretty aggressively pivoting back to digital transformation? Is it something that they're teeing up for 2021 once they get through this year? Just would like to hear a little bit more about just the tenor of conversations you're having.",Josh Beck,4393956
,,,,
12297,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. No, absolutely. I think what we are seeing is at the upper end of the market is that they realize this work from home phenomena. The productivity they got from the people has really shifted their outlook on real estate, on how are you going to treat your people population, because all of us are competing for talent.",Pierre Naude,4393956
,,,,
12298,Question-and-Answer,"And then you have to look at the experience of the relationship managers out in the field and the tools you give them. So this has driven a heightened awareness and urgency towards that. So I see traction at the top end of the market as well as the middle. When it comes to the community banks, they had a bigger impact because of PPP, the workload that was done, the disruption through COVID, et cetera.",Pierre Naude,4393956
,,,,
12299,Question-and-Answer,"Community banks was ahead of the curve like a ConnectOne, which is a great friend of ours and has deployed this early and is really adopting it widely that ahead of the curve, and there and New Jersey and to do business in New York City all the time was with a lot of lockdowns and restrictions. So if you ask Frank, he's ready.",Pierre Naude,4393956
,,,,
12300,Question-and-Answer,"The one that's behind, I think it'll take a while to solve because we have to see what happens to this next several PPP, and how it impacts their productivity and what they have to do. But I feel very good that if you look at the pipelines and we mentioned we've got very strong pipelines, the highest ever is that, the banks are engaged and they realize they have to do that. And our job now is to close it, move the project forward.",Pierre Naude,4393956
,,,,
12301,Question-and-Answer,"Great. And maybe just following up on the pipeline commentary, that's certainly encouraging. Maybe just help us think about converting that into bookings and maybe what that cycle looks like versus a pre-COVID, I imagine that we're still in a transition period here, but just would be curious your commentary there?",Josh Beck,4393956
,,,,
12302,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, we are seeing that the activation schedule is returning back to normal. So if I look at the contract structures we're seeing now, remember PPP accelerated the activation schedule tremendously, so the contract and the revenue right away. And that's why you're going to have a tough compare either quarter-over-quarter or maybe next year just because of that holistic phenomena.",Pierre Naude,4393956
,,,,
12303,Question-and-Answer,"But as you look at what's happening out there now and the contracts I'm seeing, we're getting back to the more normal transformational projects with the rollout schedule and activation schedules that mimics the historical trends of what we saw on the company, which tells me two things. The first one, this is not a patchwork of solutions, this is to slam it on to say, I've got some of these will front end. It actually is people seriously looking at their middle back offices and how they are going to operate in the future, which is a good sign for us. And I think it's 100% the right sign for the banks to address it that way.",Pierre Naude,4393956
,,,,
12304,Question-and-Answer,,Pierre Naude,4393956
,,,,
12305,Question-and-Answer,"Okay, really helpful. Thanks, Pierre.",Josh Beck,4393956
,,,,
12306,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. Good to talking to you.,Pierre Naude,4393956
,,,,
12307,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler. You may proceed in your question.,Operator,4393956
,,,,
12308,Question-and-Answer,"Good afternoon. And thanks for taking my questions here. I have a couple one for Pierre and then a couple follow ups for David, if I could. Pierre, I wanted to ask about the partner strategy. Obviously, you've had some great partners and some niche partner like Monroe, but we're starting to see a pretty nice uptick in hiring at some of the larger SI partners, particularly the Deloitte kind of stands out here. And just wondering how should we interpret some of these bigger SIs and increased hiring activity? Do you see that as a precursor to maybe a larger bank automation investment cycle coming? Is there big incentives for these larger SIs to build practices around nCino? Just trying to understand and tie why we're seeing the uptick in some of those SI partners around nCino specifically?",Brent Bracelin,4393956
,,,,
12309,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, we are in constant communication with our partners. It's such a large go to market engine and dependency for us. As you know, and you can actually see it in our own PS revenue trends that we want to have our own competent teams to help and assist we know the product base. However, as we look across and that's reflecting in our pipelines, is that these companies all know that once we get out of COVID, who knows how long that will take, but we all read the news. It's going to be a different world, the customer and consumers are expecting a different level of interaction. And there's many banks wondering will people ever come back to the branches at the same volumes that they used to come before, because they've learned new habits.",Pierre Naude,4393956
,,,,
12310,Question-and-Answer,"So we are seeing that reflection and you see in the hiring is actually reflected in our pipelines and the activities and conversations we're having with the largest banks in the world around what is your operating model, what is the real estate model, what is the brand strategy and how do you automate the workflows of these people and what tools you provide.",Pierre Naude,4393956
,,,,
12311,Question-and-Answer,"So I think you're onto something there that that is a leading indicator, we see it in our pipes for where the business is going.",Pierre Naude,4393956
,,,,
12312,Question-and-Answer,"Great. Super encouraging there. And then I guess for you, David. I apologize, I popped on here. Did you give us an RPO metric yet? Or is that something we'll have to wait for the Q to look at?",Brent Bracelin,4393956
,,,,
12313,Question-and-Answer,"Yep. No, we can talk that will be filed in the Q tomorrow. But I'll give you details here. So total RPO came in at 453 in total, less than 24 months was 299 and then greater than 24 months was 154. So it's down sequentially about $3 million, but not surprising this is normal and seasonal for this time of the year. Q3 is our lowest billing period and our lowest renewal period of the year. So this is normal, don't look into it. And this is what we expected as we entered into the third quarter.",David Rudow,4393956
,,,,
12314,Question-and-Answer,"Super helpful comment. It sounds like some of that bleed off too is tied to just the PPP revenue. And you said what was that $3 million, $4 million in the quarter, I assume so that that would be the bleed down a little bit sequentially?",Brent Bracelin,4393956
,,,,
12315,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, PPP was $5 million in the quarter.",David Rudow,4393956
,,,,
12316,Question-and-Answer,"$5 million. Okay, that's helpful color. And then I guess, last question for you, David here. I know it's early looking out into 2021 and we're still well into this pandemic, but just as you think about the pipeline, as you think about the visibility of the business, how you prioritize the investments? Thinking about sales and R&D without guiding next year, do have an appetite to lean in here on the opportunity? Or are you going to be a little more cautious just trying to get an early read on the investment appetite and getting more aggressive on the sales and R&D front for next year? Thanks.",Brent Bracelin,4393956
,,,,
12317,Question-and-Answer,,Brent Bracelin,4393956
,,,,
12318,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, good question. Yes, we see the opportunity. So we are absolutely investing. We accelerated hiring into the fourth quarter for next year. We are adding salespeople on the continent Europe, because we see the demand and the interest internationally. We're adding services people there to help them in deployments of the sales. We're also making a major investment on the R&D side as well to mature the retail product to advance commercial and to work on and advance the nIQ product as well.",David Rudow,4393956
,,,,
12319,Question-and-Answer,"So we see the opportunity, the pipeline is there. The interest is there. The market is there and we're pushing ahead and investing as quickly and responsibly as we can.",David Rudow,4393956
,,,,
12320,Question-and-Answer,"Good stuff, great to hear. Thanks again.",Brent Bracelin,4393956
,,,,
12321,Question-and-Answer,Thank you.,David Rudow,4393956
,,,,
12322,Question-and-Answer,Thank you.,Pierre Naude,4393956
,,,,
12323,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. And our last question comes from Brian Peterson with Raymond James. You may proceed with your question.,Operator,4393956
,,,,
12324,Question-and-Answer,"Great, thanks. This is Alex Sklar for Brian. Pierre, I want to start with mix, and just curious about the product release cadence for some of the AI and analytics tools around that, if that's kind of a similar spring fall cadence. I know you've been working on a commercial and retail pricing as well as the automated spreading you talked about today.",Alex Sklar,4393956
,,,,
12325,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. So obviously, as you can imagine, we do some of that development work here in Wellington. We've got visible equity in Utah, working on all our data lakes, our analytics, et cetera. And then we've got the data recognition team in Melbourne, Australia. And I will tell you, this is a test always for the company culture to see if you can work over three territories like this an integrated product. Because all these products are integrated into the bank operating system and provides the bank officer as well as the consumer a singular experience, it doesn't feel discombobulated.",Pierre Naude,4393956
,,,,
12326,Question-and-Answer,"We do follow those release schedules, but we are pushing automation of releases to the point where we can actually release interim releases and do push upgrades to customers as is required. We stick to the twice a year cadence now. But we actually do every now and then of course upgrade in between. Specifically as somebody on a project and we want to accelerate the adoption of that, which is actually being very well received.",Pierre Naude,4393956
,,,,
12327,Question-and-Answer,"But also remember, if we upgrade the bank, they have to absorb the upgrade and the new features. And many times for these banks to take these continuous upgrades and a lot of the features is very difficult to absorb. And that's why we stick to this more disciplined approach. And then we'll make exceptions on a project basis. Does that make sense?",Pierre Naude,4393956
,,,,
12328,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, that's great. And then just one follow-up. I'm curious, as we've kind of progressed through the pandemic here, has that caused any changes in what you're replacing? I know you had the kind of four big buckets on the competitive landscape and what you were placing historically. I'm wondering if that's changed at all, as a result of the pandemic.",Alex Sklar,4393956
,,,,
12329,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. There's one thing we did see. In the old days, traditionally, we would go in and tackle the middle back office, automate debt, and then roll out portals to the front ends once and I always call it 150 in the kitchen. Now we're beginning to see some of these bigger banks. Look at the nCino platform. They like what they see. But they may do deposit account open as a front end solution first, and just do that and once they've got that in play, because that's an urgent priority for them, we will roll from there maybe to commercial lending or small business lending or retail.",Pierre Naude,4393956
,,,,
12330,Question-and-Answer,"So we've now got this thing down where we actually go part of live and do a quick hit with a quick solution be in production in two months or three months, and then expand further depending on that priority. And I clearly see that is because of change behavior, because of COVID and the lockdowns and we can go to the brand system and so on to help their people to be productive in this environment.",Pierre Naude,4393956
,,,,
12331,Question-and-Answer,,Pierre Naude,4393956
,,,,
12332,Question-and-Answer,"Okay, great. Really helpful. Thanks, guys.",Alex Sklar,4393956
,,,,
12333,Question-and-Answer,Thank you.,Pierre Naude,4393956
,,,,
12334,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Pierre Naude for any further remarks.,Operator,4393956
,,,,
12335,Question-and-Answer,"Well, thank you. And thank you all for attending our earnings call today. As I hope you picked up in my comments, I'm really excited about the road ahead for nCino. Our pipeline has never been stronger and the conversations we are having, along with signed contracts in hand reflect the increasing global demand for the digital transformation of financial services.",Pierre Naude,4393956
,,,,
12336,Question-and-Answer,"While we all wait impatiently for the vaccine to be widely distributed and the resumption of a normal world, there is no going back for banks. The digital transformation is underway and only accelerating, and we believe nCino was uniquely positioned to capitalize on this tremendous opportunity. Thank you for your time today.",Pierre Naude,4393956
,,,,
12337,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",Operator,4393956
,,,,
12338,Presentation,"Please be advised that this conference call is being recorded. Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the North West Company Inc. Third Quarter Results Conference Call. I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Edward Kennedy, President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Kennedy, please go ahead.",Operator,4393954
,,,,
12339,Presentation,"Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our Q3 conference call. I'd like to introduce on our call from Northwest this afternoon, Amanda Sutton, our VP, Legal and Corporate Secretary; John King, our Chief Financial Officer; Alex Yeo, who is the President of our Canadian Retail Group. And Dan McConnell, who is President of our International Retail Group. Before I start with my remarks, I'd like Amanda to read our disclosure statement.",Edward Kennedy,4393954
,,,,
12340,Presentation,"Thank you, Edward. Before we begin, I remind you that certain information presented today may constitute forward-looking statements. Such statements reflect North West's current expectations, estimates, projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks, which could cause actual performance and financial results in the future to vary materially from those contemplated in the forward-looking statements. ",Amanda Sutton,4393954
,,,,
12341,Presentation,"For additional information on these risks, please see North West's annual information form and its MD&A under the heading Risk Factors. Edward?",Amanda Sutton,4393954
,,,,
12342,Presentation,"Thanks, Amanda. Like the last quarter, I'm going to allocate time to both Alex and Dan to talk about their respective businesses. And I'll do that very shortly. I'll provide a general overview right now. I'll talk about the airline. Then after Alex and Dan have spoken, I'll wrap up with some comments about the outlook and our priorities that they didn't cover. ",Edward Kennedy,4393954
,,,,
12343,Presentation,"In general, you've seen the press release and the -- our disclosure for the quarter, this is a continuation that's really started in March with the dramatic shifts in consumer behavior and everything else in our society tied to COVID-19 and the pandemic. Our business has been, in general, on a net basis. Favorably impacted to the extent that we're an everyday needs retailer. People are staying close to home. We're very strong in working and operating effectively in some difficult circumstances. That's kind of the nature of what we do. So now we've layered on the realities of the pandemic. So some of this, I say it comes natural to us, but it plays to inherent strengths in North West and putting safety first, reliability right up there with it in terms of in stock supply and being reliably safe. ",Edward Kennedy,4393954
,,,,
12344,Presentation,"I'm very pleased to say that amongst our associates, the contraction rate is less than 1%. Stores have not had to close unless required by a community order. We've been able to keep our stores staffed and fully operational. And I believe, exceeded expectations, at least compared to other retailers in the space and we look at our market share. So I have a huge amount of pride and acknowledgment that I want to start by talking about. When things are busy as they are for us, and we have to find more product to sell, and we have to operate stores with much higher volumes than we had planned or expected. It's very, very demanding. When individuals cannot take time away from work in the normal way they or they would through vacations and travel geographically, that adds to stress and strain as well. ",Edward Kennedy,4393954
,,,,
12345,Presentation,,Edward Kennedy,4393954
,,,,
12346,Presentation,"We're not at a breaking point by any means. This -- we realize that the pandemic is going to continue for many more months in different shapes and forms as we get to broad dissemination of the vaccine. But we're -- we're very, very attendant and aware of stresses and strains, fatigue factors, et cetera. And I think we're doing as good a job as we all can to reenergize and stay focused on meeting the customer needs first-hand as we also pivot towards what post pandemic looks like through the second half of next year and beyond. ",Edward Kennedy,4393954
,,,,
12347,Presentation,"Again, trend-wise, there's no great surprise in the quarter. And as far as the -- a little bit about the outlook, we see it continuing, not just through Q4 but into Q1 and 2, obviously, there's big numbers to compare to in terms of 2020, but there's a lot of other drivers in the market in the communities that we serve that suggest that we're going to continue to be riding a higher level of sales and ultimately margin profit performance well into next year, and we think beyond. ",Edward Kennedy,4393954
,,,,
12348,Presentation,"I'll say one thing before I turn -- I'm going to turn first to Alex and then to Dan. Regarding the airline, we don't have our airline President on the call. But -- so North Star Air had another very good quarter in terms of cargo. Passenger business started to turn down with lockdowns. But the -- and that had an effect on revenue there. But the cargo side was running at a very high efficiency. Tied directly to the cargo volumes that connect to our sales in our Northern Canada group. ",Edward Kennedy,4393954
,,,,
12349,Presentation,"And it really gave us a high confidence level and a good learning on how we can we can turn our planes fast, safely and efficiently, get the load factors to where they need to be. And I think this is one example where there's great learnings during these busy times or quarters of our of our business that we can take that and build on it. And suffice to say, North Star Air exceeded plan again this quarter and was a positive contributor to our bottom line. ",Edward Kennedy,4393954
,,,,
12350,Presentation,"With that, I'm going to stop now for a bit, and I'm going to turn the conference call over to Alex. And any questions you might have for him on Northern Canada. And then we'll do the same with -- for Dan McConnell, talking about our international business. Alex, over to you.",Edward Kennedy,4393954
,,,,
12351,Presentation,"Thanks, Edward. This is Alex. So in Northern Canada, as Erik mentioned, we will continue to see market share gains across the banner, and this is reflected in our food and general merchandise sales. There are a number of factors here, some of which continue onwards from Q2. And the biggest factor in the quarter was really the increased travel restrictions due to the increasing number of COVID-19 cases. So similar to Q2, we're able to capture greater in community spending because of our everyday offering around food and general merchandise. ",Alex Yeo,4393954
,,,,
12352,Presentation,"But I would also call, just as importantly, I think our procurement and logistics and store teams did an excellent job this quarter. We're able to get food and general merchandise products into our stores, and we're able to meet the increased demand from our customers and keep the spending in market. The thing I want to call is to echo what Edward said. I think we saw a very strong execution and collaboration between the Northern Canadian store teams and logistics team. And NSA this kind of smooth flow of freight as really a strong competitive advantage and allowing us to really capture the greater in community spending in Q3. ",Alex Yeo,4393954
,,,,
12353,Presentation,"The other factor was related to the continued support from the government that really helped it may change above-average customer income. We saw a significant number of customers transition from CERT to the 2 new COVID-19 programs, the recovery caregiving benefit as well as the Canadian recovery benefit, so those were the factors that we saw drive our sales in Q3. While we continue to see positive customer response with our ongoing pricing investment, COVID-19 has made it very challenging to get a full rate on the results and payback period of this pricing investment. We all have a clear picture on the payback and results of pricing investment until COVID situation starts to stabilize most likely second half of 2021. ",Alex Yeo,4393954
,,,,
12354,Presentation,,Alex Yeo,4393954
,,,,
12355,Presentation,"And so what we are doing is slowing down the role of the pricing investment until the second half of 2021, when we have a clear read on payback results in customer response. And what this means is that I had mentioned on the last investor call, a total pricing investment of about $8 million to $10 million for 2021. And because of this slowdown, we now anticipate only investing about $3 million to $4 million in 2021 as a result. ",Alex Yeo,4393954
,,,,
12356,Presentation,"On the expense side, we saw improved expense trends, primarily coming from better management of our COVID-19 related expenses, such as PPE and supplies. And as mentioned last quarter, another factor was the fact that we transitioned from a broad -- across the banner premium pay program to 2 different programs. One that was more targeted premium pay for when the store experiences a COVID-19 outbreak in the community, and a special like year-end front MI bonus program. So those are the factors around expenses. ",Alex Yeo,4393954
,,,,
12357,Presentation,"As we look to next year, as I would mentioned, our sales outlook remains largely positive versus historical trends. With the current vaccination plan that's been announced by the government, we anticipate that trial restrictions will remain into place into the second quarter of next year, and this will help to increase in community spending. In addition, customer incomes will continue to remain above average. One factor there is the COVID-19 programs that will -- the caregiver and benefit as well as the Canada recovery benefit. This will continue to go on into the early part of second quarter of 2021. The other factor is really the payments from the day school settlement. The Day school settlement is the compensation payment to all envision Canadians across Canada who are forced intend Indian day schools. And each customer, each community of Canadian will get a check of $10,000 or more as private settlement. ",Alex Yeo,4393954
,,,,
12358,Presentation,"And to date, they've already been close to about 90-plus thousand claims made and 40,000 of these claims have already been paid out, and we expect more of these claims to be made and settled going to next year. ",Alex Yeo,4393954
,,,,
12359,Presentation,"A fair amount of these payments will flow to customers in our communities well into 2021, and that's another factor that will help to sustain our customers' incomes. The other thing that I think is a positive factor in '21 is our buying relationship with GT. Off to a good start, and we expect it to provide momentum to our business in two ways. Firstly, we anticipate that our joint procurement exercise in food will allow us to get cost savings as a result of combining our volumes. And I'll have more details in the next 1 to 2 quarters as we finish up this procurement work. ",Alex Yeo,4393954
,,,,
12360,Presentation,"The second factor and benefit from the GT relationship is that we expect to source more general merchandise from GT, which will also provide new, more relevant assortment at the same or lower prices to our customers. And will really be a key factor in allowing us to hold to the market share that we've captured this year during COVID-19. ",Alex Yeo,4393954
,,,,
12361,Presentation,"On the expense front, we anticipate expenses to be roughly flat going to next year. While COVID-19 related expenses will decrease once the vaccine is in place, these lower COVID-19 expenses will be offset by a catch-up of maintenance, repairs and other operating expenses that we've deferred this year due to COVID-19 travel restrictions. ",Alex Yeo,4393954
,,,,
12362,Presentation,"The last comment I will make is around COVID-19. We do foresee this continuing to be an operational risk into 2021. In the benefit significant outbreak that could require a source after isolate. We anticipate that we would need to run a store with different kinds of staffing models that could either affect sales or drive expenses. As Edward said, though, we've management team service so far, and we're actively working to mitigate this risk, and I'm confident we can continue to mitigate this risk. ",Alex Yeo,4393954
,,,,
12363,Presentation,,Alex Yeo,4393954
,,,,
12364,Presentation,"We developed back our operational plans for all of our stores and working with community leaders and Public Health officials to ensure that in these scenarios, we have access to rapid testing and flexible quarantine requirements to able us to keep store service up across our network. ",Alex Yeo,4393954
,,,,
12365,Presentation,So those are my comments around the answer Northern Canadian business and out with you next year. I'll pause there.,Alex Yeo,4393954
,,,,
12366,Presentation,"Thanks, Alex. I think before we do questions, we'll get through the whole business overview, and we'll start -- we'll go next to Dan. Dan?",Edward Kennedy,4393954
,,,,
12367,Presentation,"Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Happy to share the details of our successful third quarter. International continues to experience strong sales momentum. The pandemic has been challenging for everyone, but I'm proud and grateful that our teams have stepped up resilience to keep fulfilling our role as an essential service provider. Our approach continues to be based on the same 3 pillars mentioned on previous calls. First, protecting the health and safety of our customers and employees. ",Daniel McConnell,4393954
,,,,
12368,Presentation,"Next, maintaining a dependable assortment through our focus on supply chain; and lastly, an unwavering commitment to social responsibility in our communities. We continue to have a solid in-stock levels of relevant assortment in spite of current industry-wide disruptions in some parts of the supply chain. This speaks volumes not only about the tremendous job our teams have been doing in this front, but also our strong relationships with suppliers. ",Daniel McConnell,4393954
,,,,
12369,Presentation,"Similarly, our logistics and store teams have shown leadership and managing increases in volume and our merchandising, pricing and marketing approaches have been tailored to seize current opportunities such as shifts in consumer spending, particularly one shop stop shopping and more in home dining and entertainment. Also, less out of market travel has allowed customers to shop more at our stores. ",Daniel McConnell,4393954
,,,,
12370,Presentation,"And of course, although not as high as in previous quarters, the availability of additional government income support, particularly in U.S. markets. Here, unemployment benefit top-ups and additional emergency allotments of Snap funds, commonly known as food stamps, continue to fuel sales growth. ",Daniel McConnell,4393954
,,,,
12371,Presentation,"All of these factors, coupled with better service and safety standards, have allowed us to gain market share in specific territories, even islands with no or little income support like Barbados and Cayman. As many food retailers have experienced customer counts have generally declined, while basket sizes have increased given mobility restrictions during the pandemic. However, we operate in very diverse markets, and this is not the case for all of our markets. For example, in Pacific, cost you less, we saw a 5% increase in customer counts as well as a 23% increase in basket size. This was partially offset by the Caribbean markets, which is experiencing different macroeconomic realities. Therefore, our total banner customer count decreased by 1%, and our basket size increased 15% on a same-store basis. ",Daniel McConnell,4393954
,,,,
12372,Presentation,"Alaska has followed a similar trend as other retailers with lower same-store customer counts, and higher basket sizes as an increase of 23%. This might be a good time to transition and talk about some of the economic headwinds our markets have been facing and how we have been managing them. Some Caribbean markets have been impacted by the slowdown of tourism. The British Virgin Islands have been shut down for travel since late March, and its GDP in 2020 is forecasted to shrink between 13% and 17%. A brief increase in COVID-19 cases, particularly in September, was met with government-imposed restrictions and curfews that included closure of our stores. This represented the equivalent of 72 less trading days for the quarter. BVI reopened borders December 1 with certain restrictions. We will closely monitor the situation and continue to focus on expense control, assortment, in-stock position and safety protocols. The former Dutch territories of St. Martin and are also experiencing headwinds, given its limited government financial support. ",Daniel McConnell,4393954
,,,,
12373,Presentation,,Daniel McConnell,4393954
,,,,
12374,Presentation,"Our guiding principles and approach are all similar here. On the other hand, performance has been hampered by travel and mobility restrictions for a handful of stores in Alaska's Southeast region, where communities depend on tourism and commercial fishing. Thousands of workers come to work temporary jobs on fisheries during the summer. And although the season peaks in July, some of the employment and income effects will potentially linger on until year-end. Now that the stage has been set, we can go ahead and talk about our results. ",Daniel McConnell,4393954
,,,,
12375,Presentation,"Sales growth for the third quarter continues to be robust and seen throughout the year. An increase in sales of 17.2% compared to Q3 last year was led by same-store sales increase of 10.8% and the continued solid performance of our reopening of St. Thomas USVI. Food sales increase of 17.4% in total were up 9.6% on total comp stores. As a part of our deep community relations commitment, we continue to execute the contract we were awarded with the USDA food Box program deliver to several hard to reach communities throughout rural Alaska. ",Daniel McConnell,4393954
,,,,
12376,Presentation,"Overall for international, produce, grocery food and meat led category performance. In the back of strong in stock positions as well as our signature category program and cost you less. General merchandise sales increased 20.9% in total and 21% comp in spite of the fact that we were comping against the permanent fund dividend PFD in Alaska, which was released early this July instead of its regular issuance in October. It's also worth noting that, obviously, we picked up sales from those funds last quarter instead of this one, that the PFD was 992 this year versus $1,600 last year. ",Daniel McConnell,4393954
,,,,
12377,Presentation,"General merchandise had strong performance of big-ticket motorized sales, particularly in Alaska, for international as a whole category such as entertainment, media, housewares and support notes are living had a robust quarter. Here, we look to play to our strengths, particularly in, where the warehouse format allows not only to be competitive in pricing and assortment. But also for a safer, more socially distant shopping experience. ",Daniel McConnell,4393954
,,,,
12378,Presentation,"Again, our merchandising, pricing and marketing approach allows us to capitalize on the one-stop shopping behaviors. Additional income from government support in certain markets and other travel restrictions. In terms of gross profit, Q3 has increased 14.1% to last year driven fundamentally by sales and offset by a lower gross profit rate given the slow performance of BVI and the resulting higher blend of cost sales, which, of course, are lower margin, consistent with its format. ",Daniel McConnell,4393954
,,,,
12379,Presentation,"Looking ahead, recent news, the deployment of COVID-19 vaccine is encouraging for markets that are currently experiencing low tourism. We outlook that somewhere around mid-2021, these markets will start to see positive impacts of the vaccine in terms of mobility and its resulting economic pickups. At the same time, we expect tailwinds to continue in Alaska, the Pacific and U.S. territories in the Caribbean as a stimulus package discussions on the U.S. Congress have restarted and a potential deal seems closer to being approved. We also expect to keep our market share gains based on the execution of our 3 pillars across the international banners, being reliably in stock, combined with current customer shopping behaviors will continue to tip scales in our favor. ",Daniel McConnell,4393954
,,,,
12380,Presentation,"In Alaska, our e-commerce business from stores was launched in April 2020, complementing our existing span elite start store e-commerce service. Growth during 2020 has been strong, and we will definitely focus on this in the up and coming year. We also expect to continue expanding our Alaskan footprint in the up and coming years with new store openings averaging between 3 and 4 new stores a year. ",Daniel McConnell,4393954
,,,,
12381,Presentation,,Daniel McConnell,4393954
,,,,
12382,Presentation,"Coming full circle, our focus will remain on supply chain and merchandising efforts to continue to capture these market opportunities. Especially in the near -- near year coming into Christmas holiday season as well as the continued development of our B2B channels. Of course, we don't expect to be 2020 performance, but our 2021 CAGR to 2019 will definitely be further hit. What it would be otherwise.",Daniel McConnell,4393954
,,,,
12383,Presentation,"Okay. Thanks, Alex, and thanks, Dan. Just to fill in a few things that weren't mentioned. Actually, Dan ended on 1 of the points I was going to bring up. And that is -- in terms of our CapEx spend and outlook for growth, in our disclosure, we mentioned $75 million and with growth upside. I do expect that to go higher. And it's all good news as far as we're concerned because this would be accretive investment, pure growth today, we signed off in four new stores, two acquisitions and two new stores, all in new markets, two in Alaska and two in Northern Canada. We'll continue to look for other accretive investments of our cost-saving nature, specifically in refrigeration and even some owned versus lease scenarios where the cap rates in Northern Canada are way in excess of our WACC. ",Edward Kennedy,4393954
,,,,
12384,Presentation,"And then on top of that, as we look situationally at what's going on around us, we have a couple of situations that may result in a larger growth opportunity through acquisition. But the bread and butter is along the lines of what Dan and Alex have mentioned, the pricing investment in Northern Canada. We want to come back to that when we have more visibility of the actual impact. We are doing it now, but in a little more controlled way than we expected. ",Edward Kennedy,4393954
,,,,
12385,Presentation,"And then in Alaska, a much stronger growth mandate and ambition than we've had before. A lot of this is -- has been delayed. You can say it's a good problem, but I can't overstate the intensity of the reactive nature of our business today, when we're getting the sales we are and serving the customers as we are. And keeping our stores safe. We're also very cognizant of the fact that the next 3 months could be the most challenging in terms of operating conditions in our stores and the safety considerations that I've mentioned. And many of you have probably noted, some of the recent upsurges, not just broadly speaking in -- around the world, but in Northern Canada, specifically and in First Nations, where there's been some very, very difficult community situations with very high contraction community spread rates. So our contingency plans are, first and foremost, built on safety, but also redundancy planning that will allow us to keep numerous stores open through backup teams that can be mobilized to be in community if required. These were all scenario plans that we had in place since last spring. If they will be put to the test, at all. And we all hope not with all the efforts to flatten the curve and then vaccine distribution, it's going to happen in the next 3 months. ",Edward Kennedy,4393954
,,,,
12386,Presentation,"At the same time, these heightened lockdown measures mean that there'll be more in community spending. So either way you look at it, we're going to continue to be extremely busy. But we also are pivoting, as Alex and Dan mentioned, to these post pandemic realities and opportunities and we do believe we have a solid market position. It won't be like 2020. We're not pretending that it's going to be 2020 levels. But beginning of the second half of 2021, we think our format strength and what we've proven to our customers. And in terms of behavior changes or shopping local, our resiliency and reliability, whether it's the format strength of call or the brand of our Northern and Northmart stores and AC will result in some market share retention. ",Edward Kennedy,4393954
,,,,
12387,Presentation,"And as Dan mentioned, our CAGR expectations off of 29 actuals are quite far ahead of where they otherwise would have been based on having connected with our customers the way we have in the last year and still 6 more months or so to come. ",Edward Kennedy,4393954
,,,,
12388,Presentation,,Edward Kennedy,4393954
,,,,
12389,Presentation,"With that, I'm going to open for questions. Before I do, I'm going to check with John King, our CFO, to see if John, listening to all 3 of us, we've missed anything that we should comment on before questions.",Edward Kennedy,4393954
,,,,
12390,Presentation,"No, I don't think so, Edward. I think we should go to questions.",John King,4393954
,,,,
12391,Presentation,"Okay. Operator, we'll do that. We'll open the call for questions, please.",Operator,4393954
,,,,
12392,Question-and-Answer,[Operator Instructions]. We have the first question from Michael Van Aelst from TD Securities.,Operator,4393954
,,,,
12393,Question-and-Answer,"Thanks very much. I try to keep up with all those comments. Some good detail, but came up pretty fast. So let me just, I guess, go over a few things. As far as NSA is concerned, are you able to give us any more financial metrics around its performance this quarter in terms of revenues and where you stand relative to the original EBITDA targets?",Michael Van Aelst,4393954
,,,,
12394,Question-and-Answer,"We're in line with the EBIT target, given that most of the D.A. goes back for the engine. And I don't think I can give you more specific guidance. At one point, we talked about the investment and the RONA on our cumulative investment, which is close to $100 million. And we see that being accretive to our business based on the way the year is turned out in our future projections. I think I would leave it there. And just say that we're on a -- it's been -- each quarter has been more solid. And although it seems frantic, I maybe we spoke too fast. If we convey the sense that we're really busy, we are but the airline actually has been slowing down in terms of stability and predictability in their operations, and we're getting a better and better handle on optimization. So I know I'm not directly answering the question, but I'll just say that it is meeting our financial expectations. With the exception of the passenger business, which we know will come back post pandemic.",Edward Kennedy,4393954
,,,,
12395,Question-and-Answer,"So the passenger revenues are down, but you -- but your cargo business is up, would that mean your external revenues from NSA are actually down just from an accounting perspective?",Michael Van Aelst,4393954
,,,,
12396,Question-and-Answer,They would be. That's correct.,Edward Kennedy,4393954
,,,,
12397,Question-and-Answer,Okay. You talked about annual incentive plan costs being higher is that because of -- it was a strong year or because there are new plans that will keep these costs higher in future years as well?,Michael Van Aelst,4393954
,,,,
12398,Question-and-Answer,"No. 90% of it is because of the year itself against target LY and the other measures we use. There was an enhancement in Northern Canada, but it's not material to your question. It's -- so next year, we'll be significantly lower compensation. And lastly, of course, we were to be so far ahead like we are this year, but that's not realistic.",Edward Kennedy,4393954
,,,,
12399,Question-and-Answer,And are you able to give us any idea of what that range of annual incentive time costs were?,Michael Van Aelst,4393954
,,,,
12400,Question-and-Answer,"John, what's your thought on that.",Edward Kennedy,4393954
,,,,
12401,Question-and-Answer,"Mike, we typically wouldn't get down to that level of information, Mike and here. We did break out the share-based compensation costs, which I know you look at.",John King,4393954
,,,,
12402,Question-and-Answer,"Having said that, though, and this is -- I'll say we'll take it under advisement in terms of disclosure because the swings can be quite large when you come out of the year we're headed -- we just look like we're headed to finish and go into next year.",Edward Kennedy,4393954
,,,,
12403,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. In the press release or the MD&A, you talked about some new growth areas that you're seeing. What exactly are you referring to on that front?",Michael Van Aelst,4393954
,,,,
12404,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. Well, first of all, on the individual store scale or it's tuck-in acquisitions. And I don't think it's COVID triggered. I think we're just we're more focused now and intentional on that. We freed up a bit of our time from the reaction to COVID. Independent store owners, community owned stores. As I mentioned, the four stores we just signed off on today are to build in two acquisitions. Dan mentioned trying to get at least 4 of those done a year in Alaska. The other growth we're talking about right now, we're looking at is telehealth. We've put some investment into that. There seems to be a good confluence of circumstance where we can now do remote diagnostics with our physician business. We've got an industry-leading telepharmacy platform, and we're now putting the code together to put this in place for a full medical suite. ",Edward Kennedy,4393954
,,,,
12405,Question-and-Answer,,Edward Kennedy,4393954
,,,,
12406,Question-and-Answer,"I'll be very happy to give you more detail on that in upcoming quarters. But that's more of a -- it's a greenfield or ground up, but it leverages our existing position in health right now with pharmacy and our small physician service business and it's being indirectly COVID enabled. The larger potential acquisition type investments, I can't give you specifics, except to say that we're talking and discussing and analyzing who's in our retail space that we might be interested and working with further partnership acquisition. ",Edward Kennedy,4393954
,,,,
12407,Question-and-Answer,"And I'd say that's probably where the waterfront is covered on growth. The rest of our growth is back into the core business and some of the CapEx, I mentioned in terms of expense saving initiatives that we think are there for us.",Edward Kennedy,4393954
,,,,
12408,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. And can you actually give us some color on these two new store builds and two new acquisitions, maybe the size of them and where they are?",Michael Van Aelst,4393954
,,,,
12409,Question-and-Answer,"They'd be smaller stores, ones and they're both -- 2 of them are in Nunavut and 2 are in Alaska, not prepared to announce the actual locations. But they would be medium to smaller stores, which is really what's on the docket for us. It's consolidating into to the next level of stores that we don't currently have stores and particularly in Alaska, where we identified some 45 locations.",Edward Kennedy,4393954
,,,,
12410,Question-and-Answer,So are these c-store type?,Michael Van Aelst,4393954
,,,,
12411,Question-and-Answer,"No, no, they're not there. They would be by their general stores, so they would have the full range of offer anchored by food. I'm sorry. No, I stand corrected. The -- 1 of the acquisitions is C-store that will be a combined convenience store and motorized repair depot. Quintessentially, a northern solution, we do sometimes multiple things under the roof. But the other 3 are more conventional, General Northern stores.",Edward Kennedy,4393954
,,,,
12412,Question-and-Answer,Next question is from Sabahat Khan from RBC Capital Markets.,Operator,4393954
,,,,
12413,Question-and-Answer,"Just kind of I guess at a high level, I think when some of these COVID benefits started earlier in the year, I think the expectation was maybe to start to moderate as we got into later in the year. And obviously, the pandemics lasted longer as well, are you finding sort of market share gains or maybe some more semi permanent change in shopping habits? Kind of how has the year evolved, I guess, compared to what you may have thought a few months ago?",Sabahat Khan,4393954
,,,,
12414,Question-and-Answer,"Well, duration has been the difference. And we've all no one knew how long. And then the income supports have also been more durable, especially in Canada. I think Dan spoke about this, the format strength in Cost-U-Less and, I'd say, for example, in the market in Cayman and, we've seen something that tells us that we're suited for this kind of a shopping environment. It's really hard, as you as you probably agree, to predict what are these green shoots of significant market share gains because in the algorithm is the income of the shopper and the pandemic overhang. We know there's going to be traveling with a vengeance at some point or revenge travel, as I've heard it describe when things open up. But we're studying a lot what our customers are spending their money on with us and trying to double down on the core essential basket fill that we think we can hold with them, whether that's through promotional activity. Or just being there reliably and helping to reinforce that habit shift. ",Edward Kennedy,4393954
,,,,
12415,Question-and-Answer,"So it's too hard to tell right now, but I'll say that the duration is a surprise. And the income support in Canada, and then we expect there'll be a stimulus or support program coming out shortly in the U.S. and in general, there's been just more activity in community not so much because of the restaurant trade, that would be more of a urban supermarket thing or the shift to e-com. ",Edward Kennedy,4393954
,,,,
12416,Question-and-Answer,"For us, it's more about not traveling, staying local, shifting your spending to out on the land type activities hence, the sales of our big ticket. And I guess we're all going to see how this turns out in terms of what semi permanent shifts there are in that kind of behavior.",Edward Kennedy,4393954
,,,,
12417,Question-and-Answer,,Edward Kennedy,4393954
,,,,
12418,Question-and-Answer,Okay. And then I guess on the topic of income you mentioned or was mentioned earlier around some of the native settlement payments that are coming would sound like they could be sizable. I guess is that something that could be a multi-quarter benefit? How are you expecting that to sort of flow through?,Sabahat Khan,4393954
,,,,
12419,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. We think that's going to be -- Alex, you can jump in, but likely a full year impact and a material one on our Northern Canada business. Alex, you had started a little bit in -- what had happened so far this year and then going into next year, if you want to expand on that?",Edward Kennedy,4393954
,,,,
12420,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. The short answer is that we do expect it to be a multi-quarter benefit throughout all of next year. Again, the numbers I cited, there are about 90,000 claims right now on publicly that we made, 40,000 investments settled. So there's actually 50,000 outstanding claims to be paid out. In addition, we know that there's more claims to come. We don't have the full number. But there's more claims that will be put in. And those are the more complicated claims that will typically take 3 to 6 to 9 months of process. So for sure, we expect a lot of these incomes to come to our customers and benefit our sales over the next 4 quarters into 2021.",Alex Yeo,4393954
,,,,
12421,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. And then on the 40,000 that have been settled, and how those have kind of been paid out or settled just in? I'm just wondering if there's maybe a little bit of benefit of that already starting to flow in?",Sabahat Khan,4393954
,,,,
12422,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. So those 40,000 have been paid out, and they would have been part of the income -- above-average income that our customers have seen this year. So it's definitely a factor in our results year-to-date.",Alex Yeo,4393954
,,,,
12423,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. And then just last one on the international markets. I guess, is that the stimulus expectation in the U.S.? Are you expecting that to sort of be the flow-through effect of that to help kind of the Caribbean? How are you thinking about just the international markets over the course of the next few quarters?",Sabahat Khan,4393954
,,,,
12424,Question-and-Answer,Yes. I'll let Dan answer that and explain which exact territories and markets would benefit from the U.S. payments?,Alex Yeo,4393954
,,,,
12425,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. Yes. In fact, we kept pushing it out. We thought we were going to get it third and fourth quarter, obviously, with obvious reasons to with the U.S. politics at it was delayed. But now we're comfortable. We've projected that it's going to come out in the first quarter of 2021. The markets that have be impacted that, obviously, are the U.S. Reliant markets such as Guam, the USVI, Alaska. Those namely are the ones that would be the benefactors of that payment. And it will -- we do anticipate that it will be a nice increase in sales force throughout probably typically last 2 or 3 quarters, depending on the disbursement of money and how quickly it gets to those different regions.",Daniel McConnell,4393954
,,,,
12426,Question-and-Answer,"[Operator Instructions]. The next question is from Stephen MacLeod. Mr. McCraw, please specify your company and proceed with your question.",Operator,4393954
,,,,
12427,Question-and-Answer,"It's Steve MacLeod from BMO Capital Markets. I just had a couple of questions here. Just as it relates to the Canadian business, it sounds like this is a continuation from last quarter, but certainly, some of the tailwinds are going to extend into 2021, and Alex it sounds like you are sort of optimistic that it might extend even beyond that based on the market share gains that you've gotten. Is there any way to quantify what you view as a sustainable sales growth level or profitability level, exiting the normalization of the pandemic impact?",Stephen MacLeod,4393954
,,,,
12428,Question-and-Answer,"Sorry, go ahead.",Alex Yeo,4393954
,,,,
12429,Question-and-Answer,"No, go ahead, Alex. I was going to say take it from there.",Edward Kennedy,4393954
,,,,
12430,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, I'll start first and Edward, you can jump in. As Edward mentioned, it's -- there's a lot there's a lot of different sectors kind of affect our business right now. So I can't really give you like a definitive answer. What I can tell you is that there are a number of factors and plans we have in place to try to hold on to the market share gains. Even post pandemic. So I've mentioned GT, for example, on some of the assortment changes that we're going to make there. And the other thing that the teams are doing that in reference is we're looking very hard at how customer behaviors have changed this quarter? And what does it mean for the assortment we carry both in food and general merchandise. So I would say we've got plans to put in place to really hold on the market share gains. We have seen market share gain increases, we have plans to hold on to them post pandemic. But it's hard to give you a quantitative right now because there's so much noise and factors in each quarter. Edward, anything else you want to add?",Alex Yeo,4393954
,,,,
12431,Question-and-Answer,,Alex Yeo,4393954
,,,,
12432,Question-and-Answer,"Well, I'd say that as sort of the dust settles and we see the where consumer mobility is, and that would tie directly to the COVID vaccine distribution our price investment is certainly going to be part of the play as we get into this year. And some of the learnings that Alex's team has got, I think they've got some pretty serious price investment tests underway. They're just disturbed by all the other noise that's going on. So that will be a factor in the second half as well as far as share retention. When it comes to our planning, I mean, we're -- I think like a lot of other retailers, we're planning off of our 2020 original budgets. ",Edward Kennedy,4393954
,,,,
12433,Question-and-Answer,"And without giving you the exact numbers, the numbers that we're looking at are higher than we otherwise would have and it's -- we don't see us giving up every dollar of sales, in other words, that we got. We study where this is coming from. We look at like type stores and say, okay, if we've got penetration of big ticket consumables or durables in this market. Why didn't we get it there? What's our per capita spend going on in terms of mattresses TVs motorized are there categories and subcategories where we can be either more promotional or just more intentional by being in stock to really drive that business. And it's a nice confidence boots. When you think about Northwest, you think about growth through, through income and population and not so much share capture, but this has changed that dynamic. I mean it's -- and I think it's because we've been there with the right product. Now there's new categories. I mean you've used the one Alex of water coolers, but it's a bit about a mind shift that we should be geared to grow faster as a company in our same stores through buying into growth areas. ",Edward Kennedy,4393954
,,,,
12434,Question-and-Answer,"And although that can be, of course, income dependent. It also comes to the psychology of the way we go to work every day. And again, time will tell, but our mentality is to keep share not just by selling more of what we sold in 2020, but through new categories and items, key items that we've learned now that our customers have a real demand for that were probably being shopped out of town, and we didn't have maybe the ambition, confidence on a risk-return basis to go after those sales. We do now. ",Edward Kennedy,4393954
,,,,
12435,Question-and-Answer,"And again, I probably said a couple of times, it's not speculative, but we really have to see how this turns out. But we're placing a lot of bets there, working capital wise, that we can continue to drive sales above our normal run rates.",Edward Kennedy,4393954
,,,,
12436,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. That's great. When you turn to Alaska, is on balance, the outlook tilted towards positive or total towards negative uncertain. I just want to make sure I understand the different nuances?",Stephen MacLeod,4393954
,,,,
12437,Question-and-Answer,Go ahead now.,Edward Kennedy,4393954
,,,,
12438,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. It's definitely a positive. Yes. As far as our outlook, we see a lot of opportunities, and we do have some areas of growth that we're looking seriously at. And as I indicated with our for our year outlook, it's -- we think there's some good growth that we still realize in that region.",Daniel McConnell,4393954
,,,,
12439,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. Great. And then maybe just finally, has e-commerce as a competitive threat elevated at all through the pandemic? Or is it still something that -- or is that maybe competitive landscape hasn't really changed much?",Stephen MacLeod,4393954
,,,,
12440,Question-and-Answer,"I think uniquely for us, it hasn't changed much. It's got a very high penetration rate in Alaska compared to Northern Canada, ex a call where Amazon prime plays to 1 market in Canada. That's important to us. But in Alaska, it's a highly developed out shopping market. Dan mentioned that our dark store e-com platform has had exponential growth off an admittedly low base. Like a lot of supermarket e-com businesses. And we also sell-out of our stores on a hub-and-spoke e-com model and the go-forward that we're going to really lean into is to try to get more share in e-com. So out of both platforms or channels out of our stores as a hub to sell to smaller villages, and then a direct B2C from the dark store acreage. So I know you're asking me whether we're losing share to e-comm. I'm saying, no, it's not exploding. It's highly developed to the extent that it is developed already in Alaska and in Canada. And it hasn't shifted dramatically. And we see that through our visa loads, I might have mentioned this last quarter, where the money has been spent, not by individual, of course, but in terms of which merchants are the money is going to. ",Edward Kennedy,4393954
,,,,
12441,Question-and-Answer,,Edward Kennedy,4393954
,,,,
12442,Question-and-Answer,"And our share has increased. So again, the local spend seems to be the way people are going right now, and they haven't shifted to digital like they have in some urban markets. Yes. I have to close, then if the store closes, then it's all click and curbside pickup.",Edward Kennedy,4393954
,,,,
12443,Question-and-Answer,"Just to add one piece of color into what I was said for Northern Canada. What we found is if we're able to get the plug there quickly, and we have this quarter, the 10 -- the pivot with the convenience and to of be able to shop with our store managers in store. And so that has been a factor in terms of -- that's also protected any loss of potential market share at e-comm. It's never been -- it's not been a threat, and I think our ability by in stock is further watered off any threats in this quarter.",Alex Yeo,4393954
,,,,
12444,Question-and-Answer,Next question Matt Bank from CIBC.,Operator,4393954
,,,,
12445,Question-and-Answer,"First on the plan to ramp up store growth in Alaska. Is the biggest change there, just your own aggressiveness? Or are there also just more opportunities to add stores coming up?",Matt Bank,4393954
,,,,
12446,Question-and-Answer,"I'm going to let Dan answer, but first, I'm going to give 1 overlay. And we talked about -- and we've acted on this, splitting the business up when Dan took on the international role. He's based in. But we've created an autonomous executive team in Alaska that we took the buyers that were together for both banners out of Seattle and relocated them to either or BOCA. ",Edward Kennedy,4393954
,,,,
12447,Question-and-Answer,"In general, North West is headed towards -- we have a very strong Managing director in the BVI, more and more decentralized with more authority. And I think the lens we're seeing on the Alaska business reflects that. Maybe Dan, I'll let you pick it up from there.",Edward Kennedy,4393954
,,,,
12448,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. Yes, that's a big portion of it. And that was the first part of your question with the focus. And the second part being that there is a lot of potential, and it's really come delayed now where we're able to partner with some of our native Corps in Alaska because we have shown what we can do throughout this crisis. Our in-stock levels have been extremely strong. And the benefits, therefore, for the communities are that much more magnified. So it's both. But now we're putting the core focus to it. And again, it's -- we've had some success so far, and we're pretty excited about what's going to come down over the next 2 or 3 years? Yes. So that's.",Daniel McConnell,4393954
,,,,
12449,Question-and-Answer,"I think just to add a bit to that, like I see us right now is the only retailer of consequence in the state that's actually based there, like the decision-making authorities and accountabilities are in the state. We have to do a little bit better on GR and our government relations, but that will come with time. But the insights that we're gathering on, whether it's a stronger e-com play or lean in or new store growth, I think, is entirely tied to that. And the last time we did this, we had more decentralized management. You might ask why did you centralize it? I mean, I guess I fell into an efficiency trap. But certainly, right now, it's the right structure for the times. ",Edward Kennedy,4393954
,,,,
12450,Question-and-Answer,"And with that is on earth with his team, I think, is a real compelling growth opportunity for AC. And there'll be more to come like whether this is going a little bit deeper in our retail vertical in terms of more new locations, e-comm meet another channel, but we also see potentially down the road that it could play horizontally like it has in Northern Canada for us than whether it's an airline or in health products and services, that will be just examples of once you're in the space and you're fully entrenched in the communities again, you find different places that you can invest and be part of their everyday needs.",Edward Kennedy,4393954
,,,,
12451,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. Great. And then on the -- your sort of planning for '21 and just the general comment that you're expecting a higher CAGR than you would have previously how much of that is driven by an expectation of permanently less out of market shopping? And can you share like what percent of customer wallet as far as you can understand, is out shopped in normal years? And then anything around how that is changing and how much of that could be permanent?",Matt Bank,4393954
,,,,
12452,Question-and-Answer,,Matt Bank,4393954
,,,,
12453,Question-and-Answer,"It's too hard to do. I mean we -- having just done a deeper dive in Alaska, Dan and his team have looked at shares. Our shares are tend to be high, but they're still -- they're not 80%, they're not 90. They're not 70 cumulatively there. So there's -- we might have picked up 10% or 1,000, whatever that is, basis points. But there's still a lot of room to grow. And we haven't actually -- I don't think we can even, with confidence, get down to that granularity right now. I'll say, I guess, for the fourth time because just on our minds all the time that we're extremely reactive in a positive way to meet existing needs. So we're still assessing. And I think as the year unfolds, I mean, '21 won't look like '20, obviously. But it's going to have a lot of uncertainties attached to it. We think with upside potential. ",Edward Kennedy,4393954
,,,,
12454,Question-and-Answer,"Again, not trying to hold us to beat in 2020. That's not the point I know of your question. But that visibility that you're looking for, and people are desperately seeking. I think it has to get in line with just the natural -- as time passes and we get more proof of what's actually happening here. And obviously, it's a very big disclosure point for us in terms of letting investors know how we see the world. And the next two quarters are going to be really important. But I don't think we can go much further right now, at least to be responsible. It would be still speculative beyond what we said already. It wouldn't be useful to you.",Edward Kennedy,4393954

12455,Question-and-Answer,The next question from Michael Van as from TD Securities.,Operator,4393954
,,,,
12456,Question-and-Answer,"So along the same line, that it might be difficult, but when you -- I know that you're seeing good market share gains and you think you can hold on to a good chunk of them. But are you able to determine how much of the sales gains you're seeing this year is due to some of the temporary government income support?",Michael Van Aelst,4393954
,,,,
12457,Question-and-Answer,"Versus limitations on travel, are due to the 2 the same. I'm just trying to -- like when you -- like -- look, if we were in a non COVID environment, we'd be looking for mid- single digit comps. We'd be pretty happy with that off of maintenance CapEx and other initiatives like key role. Pricing investment, we hope would drive a little bit more than that. And I could always go back to the investor presentations that I did March right after the GT transaction in downsizing. And then I remember I had 1 slide and a couple of bullet points on COVID. Well now it's -- COVID would take up all the slides. ",Edward Kennedy,4393954
,,,,
12458,Question-and-Answer,"So you took the delta of that mid-single digits to where we are now, all of that delta belongs to something induced related to -- correlated to the pandemic. I think that's the math. I think the math is 20 minus 5% to 15, 15% or whatever the quarterly comps are. Keeping that core 5, accelerating it because we think we've got a stronger market position or having a higher absolute EBIT, EBITDA as a base year are the kind of things that I know you're thinking about and we are too, but it started out with -- we looked at the pricing investment and we reducing prices in the road stores, and that's helped, and we're still -- we've reduced prices and we'll keep trying to invest in price, but it's just so hard to tell now. And that's why we pulled back because we thought we're not learning enough about this. In the current environment. And I would allocate all that example I just gave. I would allocate the entire 15% to the pandemic and say that we -- 5 of that came from what we're going to do anyways.",Edward Kennedy,4393954
,,,,
12459,Question-and-Answer,"So I guess I'm just trying to -- so is having a hard time reconciling all the comments made because definitely, there's a lot of good things going on. But then yes. On the one hand, you're saying that you expect to see benefits continue through 2021 from a number of factors. And then I think maybe just on the international side, but probably applies to Canada, was 2021 is not likely going to be as good as 2020. And I'm just trying to understand is like -- I don't know if you're willing to go this way, but I mean, are you expecting 2021 to be down from 2020 just because 2020 is just such a huge year?",Michael Van Aelst,4393954
,,,,
12460,Question-and-Answer,,Michael Van Aelst,4393954
,,,,
12461,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, we do. I guess -- comp I don't have to explain the comp 20%. And I say that, could we be up? I mean, if I don't think we, as a society, want us North West to be up next year over the very high -- the performance figures this year because that would be a sign of a continuation of COVID with other costs that would not be good. And haven't been good for society overall. We all know that. So it's our best thinking, again, we just put a pin in it a midyear, midyear distribution. That could be a bit early, looking now at the Canadian -- the distribution information that we've got suggests that might be optimistic that there's going to be a very broad distribution by midyear. So -- but you're still comping 20% comps, right? And if you have the same circumstances, which we do expect for a couple more quarters of mobility shopping local income support, you're still comping now off of the prior year. ",Edward Kennedy,4393954
,,,,
12462,Question-and-Answer,"So you could say using your -- I think your rationale is coming from, you should at least be level to the year before on those quarters. And there's some inflation, we all know coming in with food. But the back half of the year, if we all agree and believe we're going to see COVID -- vaccine distribution, then there's going to be a different set of consumer behaviors. And now we're going to be competing or comping this year's third and fourth quarter against those different consumer behaviors. And as much as we're going to retain some of that. It would be just wrong, thought out wrong to say that we're going to get it all and more, which you'd have to be 2020. So yes, that's the super long answer. I apologize. The short answer is no. We -- our earnings would be shocking if 2021 was higher than 2020. On a multiyear CAGR off a 2019 base, I think either Dan or Alex are both pointed out that we'll be we think we'll be significantly ahead of where we'd otherwise be.",Edward Kennedy,4393954
,,,,
12463,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. That's helpful. I mean, I don't think anybody is expecting you to be able to match 2020, but it was some of the comments were quite bullish.",Michael Van Aelst,4393954
,,,,
12464,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. You know what, I think -- yes, you've got -- okay, I'm glad and I thought, boy, are you really asking us to beat 2020? No. What we're talking about is growth. If nothing happen, these are the growth things we'll be talking about. I mentioned decentralization, price investment, we lowered our admin structure. The GT divestiture, we derisked the business there. Improved our EBITDA performance and got rid of some of the CapEx that was not really helping us. So all those things we'd be talking about now, but we're not. And it's hard to do that because it's hard to isolate the -- all the positive impacts of that. But what we've tried to talk about today as well is some other growth areas. In addition to those, namely the new stores in Alaska, the e-comm in Alaska that we'd be pursuing anyways. ",Edward Kennedy,4393954
,,,,
12465,Question-and-Answer,"Opportunistic acquisitions in telehealth would be where we're -- we could do more tied to COVID, but we have no detail there to share with you. So yes, no, we're optimistic about growth because we're looking past into the new normal, and we think adding new stores will always give us growth. Getting great refrigeration into our stores with an accretive that meets our threshold is also great, too. And we certainly have the financial position to make these investments and still do our NCIB and increase our dividend and so forth. So we want to do that as well. But I don't -- I don't want to give the impression at all to anyone that we're expecting to match 2020 and 2021 in terms of cash flow.",Edward Kennedy,4393954
,,,,
12466,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. Okay. And then just one last question. Your noncontrolling interest was up 75%, 80% or something like that year-over-year, which is -- I believe this is tied to the British Virgin Island assets. So -- but I think you stated that those assets were under some pressure. So what's -- why is that up so much?",Michael Van Aelst,4393954
,,,,
12467,Question-and-Answer,,Michael Van Aelst,4393954
,,,,
12468,Question-and-Answer,I'll let John answer that.,Edward Kennedy,4393954
,,,,
12469,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, Mike, it's substantially all of the BVI. There's a little bit of noise in there in the quarter. And I think if you look you're right, though, that we did see some -- we have seen some pressure, certainly on the sales side. Our operations in the BVI have done a very good job on controlling costs. So the sales decrease was -- has been mitigated somewhat on the bottom line. But that's really what that is, the noncontrolling interest piece.",John King,4393954
,,,,
12470,Question-and-Answer,"So the profits are up meaningfully then, I guess, in BVI at this point because of that?",Michael Van Aelst,4393954
,,,,
12471,Question-and-Answer,Yes. There's another small noncontrolling interest debt within that international group that came into play as well.,John King,4393954
,,,,
12472,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. There are no further questions registered at this time. I will turn the call back to Mr. Kennedy.,Operator,4393954
,,,,
12473,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. Thanks, operator. I know we shared a lot of information, and I think we had some good discussion here. I think our commitment is, first of all, again, to our customers, our employees to be safe and reliable. I think our work in that has been strong, and we have a lot of hard work to do. And we'd like to take a short -- longer-term pardon me, post pandemic perspective. We try to share that with you but we really feel right now that on a 30, 60, 90, 6-month basis. We've got still some heavy lifting to do to serve our communities, to serve our customers, stay safe to get sales. And to keep an eye open for growth. And I think it's going to be very interesting as we get through the next 2 quarters to give our investors more clarity and ourselves gain more clarity on how this is all going to turn out. ",Edward Kennedy,4393954
,,,,
12474,Question-and-Answer,"With that, on behalf of our management team and all the folks at Northwest, I'd like to wish the investors on the call, those who listen in later, the very best of the holiday season as best as it can be. In these very trying and unusual circumstances, and we'll look forward to in the new year. We wish you a new year as well. A happy new year. To see you on the call again. I believe it's going to be April 7 with our Q1 results. Thank you very much, everyone, and take care and stay safe.",Edward Kennedy,4393954

12483,Presentation,"Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Dan. Dan?",Alan Roden,4393949
,,,,
12484,Presentation,"Thank you, Alan. I'm please to report a strong third quarter, with revenue coming in better than expected and strong year-over-year adjusted EBITDA growth of 17%. Cash from operations year-to-date was also strong, increasing 16% compared to the same period in the prior year. Looking ahead, we believe our cloud momentum will continue. We see perpetual deals gradually coming back, and our visibility has improved from prior quarters. We are resuming guidance for the year, with expectations for a strong Q4.",Dan Bodner,4393949
,,,,
12485,Presentation,,Dan Bodner,4393949
,,,,
12486,Presentation,"Also, I'm pleased to report that we are on track to complete our separation into two public companies shortly after fiscal year-end. We already made our initial confidential filing with the SEC, and plan to file publicly within the next two weeks. Ahead of our separation, we will be holding investor days and management roadshows, in January.",Dan Bodner,4393949
,,,,
12487,Presentation,"Turning to Customer Engagement, in Q3 we experienced significant cloud momentum, and we believe the industry's shift to the cloud is being accelerated by COVID. During Q3, we continued to win new cloud customers, and displaced competitors due to the significant differentiation of our cloud platform, our artificial intelligence and analytics innovation, and our partner-agnostic strategy. Here are three examples of large cloud deals. An $11 million cloud order from an existing insurance customer related to their decision to transition to SaaS. A $3 million cloud order from one of the largest pharmaceutical companies due to their rapid growth in self-service interactions, and a $2 million cloud order from one of the largest BPOs. This competitive displacement was driven by our open and agnostic partner approach, and our ability to easily integrate into their operations.",Dan Bodner,4393949
,,,,
12488,Presentation,"In addition to these large cloud orders, we saw a gradual return of perpetual license orders in Q3, which we believe will continue in Q4. Behind these large wins is our ability to address the following recent industry trends. First, customers are looking to addressing the lasting impact of COVID on their workforce. We believe our recent cloud momentum is in part due to our ability to help our customers navigate the COVID environment, creating significant opportunity for Verint going forward.",Dan Bodner,4393949
,,,,
12489,Presentation,"Second, customers today are even more focused on addressing a key strategic problem, which is how to strike the right balance between cost efficiencies and exceptional customer experience. Verint has been a market leader in workforce engagement for over two decades. And we are uniquely positioned to help organizations address this strategic problem. Third, the role of partners in our industry is increasing, and a strong partner ecosystem has become an important competitive differentiator. Unlike many competitors that offer closed solutions, Verint's open cloud platform increasingly makes us the partner of choice across the industry ecosystem.",Dan Bodner,4393949
,,,,
12490,Presentation,"And finally, we have a large customer base and are seeing an increasing number of customers express interest in converting their legacy deployments to SaaS, and we launched an attractive program in Q3, which we expect will increase the pace and number of conversions. To summarize, we believe we are uniquely positioned to address these recent industry growth trends with a focus on the evolving work environment, our open cloud platform, and an expanding partner network.",Dan Bodner,4393949
,,,,
12491,Presentation,"Turning to our outlook for the current year, we expect $835 million of revenue for our Customer Engagement segment, at the midpoint of our guidance range. Our guidance reflects a strong market shift to SaaS, and we expect to reach two important milestones this year which I would like to highlight. First, this year we expect approximately half of all the new software bookings to come from SaaS, as compared to about a third in the prior year, and only a quarter two years ago. We are pleased to be crossing over the 50% new bookings mark. And second, we expect 80% of our software revenue to be generated from recurring sources, up 400 bps from the prior year, and up 900 bps from just two years ago. We expect these KPIs to improve further next year, which I will discuss next.",Dan Bodner,4393949
,,,,
12492,Presentation,"Looking ahead to next year, we expect our cloud revenue growth to accelerate to approximately 30% driving by strong new software bookings and SaaS conversions. From a mix perspective, next year we expect two-thirds of our new software bookings coming from SaaS. We also expect that the percentage of our software revenue that is recurring to increase to 85%, another 500 bps improvement from the current year. Achieving the 85% level marks the substantial completion of our cloud transition, which will provide us many benefits including improved visibility, better economics over the lifetime of the customer, and less revenue headwind associated with cloud transitions.",Dan Bodner,4393949
,,,,
12493,Presentation,,Dan Bodner,4393949
,,,,
12494,Presentation,"Today, we are introducing long-term targets for our Customer Engagement business ahead of our planned separation. We're targeting an approximate 30% CAGR for cloud revenue over the next three years. Like other cloud transitions, we expect our revenue growth and margins to gradually improve in fiscal ending '23 and '24. We are targeting $1 billion of revenue in fiscal year ending '24, with approximately 90% of our software revenue generated from recurring sources. We will provide more detail on our three-year targets as well as review of growth strategy, TAM, and competitive differentiation during our Virtual Investor Day for customer engagements to be held on January 21.",Dan Bodner,4393949
,,,,
12495,Presentation,"Moving to our Cyber Intelligence business, today I'm excited to announce the new name for this company, which will become official upon the separation. Cognyte is coined from the words, ""Cognition and Ignite,"" to reflect the powerful, analytical nature of our security software solutions. Cognyte will be headquartered in Israel, and we'll be listed on the NASDAQ under the symbol CGNT as a foreign private issuer.",Dan Bodner,4393949
,,,,
12496,Presentation,"Our security analytics software generates Actionable Intelligence for many governments and enterprise security customers around the world. After some COVID-related impact earlier in the year, we experienced strong sequential revenue growth in Q3 and enter Q4 with improved visibility. Customers come to Verint for our mission-critical security software to help accelerate investigations of terror, crime, and cyber threats. In Q3, we received multiple large orders, including one for approximately $15 million, one order for approximately $7.5 million, and four orders for approximately $5 million each.",Dan Bodner,4393949
,,,,
12497,Presentation,"In addition, we continued to execute well on a softer model strategy. During Q3, our non-GAAP estimated fully allocated gross margins came in at 74%, and 900 bps year-over-year increase, and non-GAAP gross profit increased 21% year-over-year. We're very pleased with the progress we're making on our financial and strategic goals. Looking over the last three years, you can see the positive impact of the software model transition is having on our financials. The percentage of our revenue that is generated from software has been steadily increasing as we reduce the amount of revenue we generate from services.",Dan Bodner,4393949
,,,,
12498,Presentation,"The percentage of our revenue that is recurring is also steadily increased. The biggest part of impact to our financial model has been on gross margins. Our estimated fully allocated gross margins have increased approximately 800 basis points over the last three years. And I expect it to reach 70% this year for the first time. For revenue, we expect $445 million this year at the midpoint of our guidance. Overall, our Cyber Intelligence management team is executing well and has built a solid foundation to be a successful independent public company.",Dan Bodner,4393949
,,,,
12499,Presentation,"Looking forward, we believe that Cognyte is well-positioned for growth and market leadership. Cognyte is a market leader in security analytics software. We have developed trusted long-term relationships with our customers, and has a very successful track record of profitable growth. Behind a leadership is our technology strength. Cognyte is at the forefront of advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning technology, which are critical for addressing the security challenges our customers face. We participate in a large $30 billion addressable market, which is growing as security challenges become more complex and customers seeking innovative, open security analytics software to meet those challenges.",Dan Bodner,4393949
,,,,
12500,Presentation,"Overall, we believe that the market trends are favorable and can support the stain growth over the long run. For next year, we expect 10% revenue growth for a Cyber Intelligence business. For fiscal year ending '23 and '24, we're targeting revenue growth to improve, driven by greater adoption of our open security software solutions. We will provide more detail on our three-year targets, as well as review our growth strategy, TAM, and competitive differentiation during Cognyte's Virtual Investor Day to be held on January 11.",Dan Bodner,4393949
,,,,
12501,Presentation,,Dan Bodner,4393949
,,,,
12502,Presentation,"And now I would like to summarize. I'm very pleased with the execution of our cloud strategy in customer engagement, and a softer moral strategy in Cyber Intelligence. I'm also very proud of the work we have done to prepare for the separation, and believe that both businesses will continue to prosper and appeal to investors, is two independent public companies.",Dan Bodner,4393949
,,,,
12503,Presentation,"Now, let me turn over the call to Doug. Doug.",Dan Bodner,4393949
,,,,
12504,Presentation,"Thanks, Dan. Good afternoon, everyone. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation between our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures is available as Alan mentioned in earnings release and in the IR section of our Web site. Differences between our GAAP, non-GAAP financial measures include adjustments related to acquisitions, including fair value revenue adjustments, amortization of acquisition related intangibles, certain other acquisition related expenses, stock-based compensation, separation-related expenses, as well as certain other items that can vary significantly in amount of frequency.",Doug Robinson,4393949
,,,,
12505,Presentation,"For certain metrics, it also has adjustments related to foreign exchange rates. Today, I'll cover four topics. First, I'll review our Q3 results in fiscal '21 guidance. Second, I will review our initial outlook for next year on an as-is basis. What we mean by ""As-is,"" is what Verint would look like if we remained as one company. This is meant to help you update your models on a consolidated basis until the separation of our two businesses occurs. We plan to provide you additional information on our Investor Day, so that will enable you to start to build model separately for each business. Third, I'll provide some additional detail regarding the separation, including the anticipated capital structures and the amount of the dissynergies we expect and fourth, I'll take you through our long-term targets for each business.",Doug Robinson,4393949
,,,,
12506,Presentation,"We're pleased with our 6% sequential revenue growth, which as Dan mentioned, came in ahead of expectations and drove a 17% year-over-year increase in adjusted EBITDA in Q3 and a 16% increase in GAAP, cash from operations on a year-to-date basis. We expect to finish the year strong and given our improved visibility, we are providing guidance. We expect non-GAAP revenue of $1.28 billion, with $330 million of adjusted EBITDA and $3.40 non-GAAP diluted EPS at the midpoint of our revenue guidance. Overall, we're pleased with our performance this year and despite COVID delaying some perpetual license orders, we expect to grow adjusted EBITDA by about $5 million year-over-year.",Doug Robinson,4393949
,,,,
12507,Presentation,"Looking ahead the next year, we believe the momentum we experience this year will continue and are introducing our initial as is outlook. We expect non-GAAP revenue to increase around 5% to $1.35 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to increase at a similar rate before separation to dissynergies, which I'll discuss in a minute. Excluding the impact of the separation, we expect around $20 million of non-GAAP interest expense, and a non-GAAP share account of $71.5 million shares. Again, we are providing this information to help you update your consolidated model depending on the separation. At our Investor Day in January, we'll provide more detail regarding the post in models of the two companies.",Doug Robinson,4393949
,,,,
12508,Presentation,"As Dan noted earlier, we plan to file our 20 at publicly in the next two weeks. We expect to consummate the separation shortly after year-end. Today we'd like to provide some additional visibility into capital structures and the synergies. Both companies will have strong balance sheets, adequate working capital, and strong cash generation post separation. Following the separation Verint will have modest net leverage about one times adjusted EBITDA, excluding the preferred stock. At this point, we expect each company to have about $15 million of separation to synergies. Most of these synergies are related to public company expense IT and other shared business service expenses.",Doug Robinson,4393949
,,,,
12509,Presentation,,Doug Robinson,4393949
,,,,
12510,Presentation,"Now I'd like to provide further information for each business on a standalone basis, starting with customer engagement. As Dan discussed earlier, we think it's very helpful analyze the customer engagement cloud and perpetual revenue stream separately. On the cloud side, we expect the momentum we experienced this year to accelerate next year. New SaaS bookings, which is a leading indicator of cloud revenue growth is expected to increase more than 40% this year, and will help drive approximately 30% cloud revenue growth next year. We expect our bookings mix to continue to shift to cloud with about two-thirds of new software bookings coming from SaaS compared to about half this year. We're also expecting recurring revenue to reach 85% of our software revenue, up 500 bps from this year.",Doug Robinson,4393949
,,,,
12511,Presentation,"Regarding perpetual licenses, due to our cloud first strategy, we expect reduction to around $140 million of revenue this year. Next year, we expect a further decline as we approach the completion of a cloud transition. Overall, for fiscal '22 for new bookings, we expect 10% growth in new perpetual license equivalent bookings, and for revenue and adjusted EBITDA, we expect low single digit growth before the synergies. We're targeting cloud revenue growth of approximately 30% CAGR over the next three years, driven by strong new SaaS bookings, healthy renewal rates, and ongoing SaaS conversions. We expect our revenue growth to improve over time following the completion of our cloud transition in fiscal '22. In fiscal '23, we expect our perpetual license revenue to level-off at around $100 million as certain customers will continue to prefer perpetual licenses.",Doug Robinson,4393949
,,,,
12512,Presentation,"Regarding margins, we expect a one-time step down in fiscal '22 due to the separation to synergies I discussed earlier, followed by ongoing margin expansion. In addition to margin expansion, the cloud model will provide us with better economics over the longer-term. Overall, we're targeting $1 billion of revenue in fiscal '24 with 90% of our software revenue being recurring. Now let's turn to our Cyber Intelligence business, which will soon be named Cognyte. I'll start with a review of our historical performance.",Doug Robinson,4393949
,,,,
12513,Presentation,"Over the last three years, our EBITDA on an estimated fully allocated adjusted basis has increased at a 25% CAGR driven by our business transformation as part of our software strategy, where we have been steadily improving our software services mix and increasing our gross margins. This trend continued into current year, where we have experienced 7% year-to-date increase and estimated fully allocated non-GAAP gross profit year-over-year and a 35% year-to-date increase in estimated fully allocated adjusted EBITDA versus last year.",Doug Robinson,4393949
,,,,
12514,Presentation,"Regarding revenue, we have seen strong sequential growth after the initial impact from COVID. For the year despite this COVID impact, we're expecting another year of growth and estimated fully allocated adjusted EBITDA and to reach 70% estimated fully allocated gross margins for the full-year for the first time. Over the next three years, we're targeting Cognyte's revenue growth to improve driven by greater adoption of our open software and expect margins to gradually expand after a one-time step down next year due to the separation to synergies.",Doug Robinson,4393949
,,,,
12515,Presentation,"Overall, Cognyte will have a strong financial profile post separation. We look forward to providing you more detail at our Virtual Investor Day on January 11. In summary, with a strong Q3 are expecting to finish the year strong and look forward to providing more information regarding the separation at our upcoming Virtual Investor Day.",Doug Robinson,4393949

12518,Question-and-Answer,,Operator,4393949
,,,,
12519,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Congrats on the ongoing solid performance and guidance. Dan, really great cloud momentum yet again. If I may ask, can you talk to us about what is driving this strong momentum? And how do you see this momentum evolving over the next few years as you move through the cloud transition? And I have a follow-up.",Shaul Eyal,4393949
,,,,
12520,Question-and-Answer,"Okay, sure. So, thank you. Yes, we see strong cloud momentum, and we see it across all regions. We've built an open cloud platform, and this allows our customers to easily turn on new cloud applications, so they can expand, and we have a broad portfolio as you know, it also allows our partners to easily integrate and add value, and I'll talk about partners later. So that's on the cloud platform side. From a sales force perspective, our sales force is leading with SaaS, and now we see great market adoption in our area, in our business application area. And this is partially due to COVID. So, we're pleased to cross over the 50% mark of new bookings that's coming from SaaS. And we, based on pipeline, expect to have two-thirds of our new booking next year to come from SaaS. We target 30% cloud revenue growth next year, so from $270 million, give or take, this year, to $350 million next year. As well, we're targeting 30% CAGR over the next three years. So I think it's important to explain to your question of how the SaaS transition is evolving, because we mentioned on prior calls, and today again that we expect to complete the SaaS transition next year.",Dan Bodner,4393949
,,,,
12521,Question-and-Answer,"So when you look at our perpetual license revenue, they declined, this year we expect about 140, and it was at 185 last year, so a big decline in perpetual license, but next year, we expect a further decline as we finish the transition, but then level off in fiscal '23. And as we have some customers that will continue to buy perpetual and expand we expect some growth in perpetual license, but it will be around $100 million, so we expect it to be 90% of our software will be recurring. So, that's kind of the perpetual revenue. And what that tell us is basically the headwinds from the perpetual revenue decline will be substantially over, and the tailwind that we get from the cloud revenue growth will fully contribute to the top line growth.",Dan Bodner,4393949
,,,,
12522,Question-and-Answer,"And the margin perspective actually for the same, the same trend. Margin expand at the end of the cloud transition, and we'll see that during fiscal '23 and '24. And then over the long-run the economics of our cloud model are actually better than the economics of the perpetual license. So we expect a lot of good, positive outcome from the momentum we see now. We do need to finish the transition next year, which we feel we are good with the metrics we shared; we are on our way to do that. And for fiscal '24, we are targeting about $1 billion, which is a CAGR of mid to high single-digit revenue growth, obviously with improving growth rates as we move toward out years.",Dan Bodner,4393949
,,,,
12523,Question-and-Answer,"Got it. And my follow-up is concerning Cognyte, so congrats on really being ready to bring it to the market and kind of the entire separation process. Over the course of the past two months Palantir has gone public. We've been getting many questions on it from investors. Maybe can you discuss how you, on one hand, similar to what they do, but maybe on the other hand differ in some other ways?",Shaul Eyal,4393949
,,,,
12524,Question-and-Answer,"Sure. So, first, we are excited to have Cognyte start the next chapter of their growth as a public company. We shared a lot of information today on the historical growth of Cognyte, and margin expansion, a huge margin expansion. So we have great opportunity ahead. We'll share even more information. And we're going to file the 20-F document in two weeks, and then two weeks later, on January 11, we're share more information on Cognyte. But let me briefly touch on your Palantir question. We are pleased to have Palantir as a public comp. Cognyte and Palantir have similar capabilities, but historically have different go-to-market strategies, which is important to understand.",Dan Bodner,4393949
,,,,
12525,Question-and-Answer,,Dan Bodner,4393949
,,,,
12526,Question-and-Answer,"So first, in terms of the similarities, both companies share the vision of open analytics, and delivery technology platforms that can help customers find the needles in the haystacks, and to make the world safer. And there is a big opportunity, but historically the companies approached opportunity with different go-to-market strategy. And I think best is to look at couple of examples. So, Cognyte had a strategy of profitable growth, as you all know as part of Verint, while Palantir, as a private company, incurred losses for many years. So one of this -- the impact of this is that, for example, Palantir has about 150 customers, and they have higher average revenue per customer, so they went deeper into their customers.",Dan Bodner,4393949
,,,,
12527,Question-and-Answer,"Cognyte has more than a thousand customers, but our strategy was to land and expand and grow these customers over time. Another example is the difference in global coverage. Palantir is stronger in the U.S., while Cognyte is stronger in the rest of the world. And the reason we have historically, we at Verint believe that the investment in developing the U.S. government market takes significant time and resources, and we saw more attractive opportunities outside the U.S. consistent with this profitable growth strategy that we were pursuing. So these are two quick examples, and we will discuss the security landscape in more detail during the investor day.",Dan Bodner,4393949
,,,,
12528,Question-and-Answer,"Got it. Thank you so much for that. Good luck, good job.",Shaul Eyal,4393949
,,,,
12529,Question-and-Answer,Thank you.,Dan Bodner,4393949
,,,,
12530,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. Our next question comes from Daniel Ives with Wedbush Securities. Your line is now open.,Operator,4393949
,,,,
12531,Question-and-Answer,"Thanks. So, maybe first just talk about, Dan, your conversations with customers and what you're hearing from sales force, I mean how things are changing in terms of the sort of cloud strategy? Do you think it's more just the product footprint, or is it customers now adopting, getting to that stage where they're looking for more significant deployments? I mean how do you sort of view where we are in terms of the cloud build-out that we're seeing across our base?",Daniel Ives,4393949
,,,,
12532,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, that's a good question. I think we're going through some interesting changing dynamics. Some of them are driven by COVID and the lasting impact of COVID on the workforce dynamics. And I think we have great solutions we are discussing with customers, and already brought some new innovation in our cloud platform to address these changes. There's more interesting automation driven by AI, again COVID is also an economic impact, and people are looking to create efficiencies through automation. And there is, I would say, an acceleration in the cloud transition, which started obviously a few years back, but we do see customers much more open to actually execute on it.",Dan Bodner,4393949
,,,,
12533,Question-and-Answer,"Now, it's very important for customers, and you know that the majority of revenues come from mid-to-large enterprises. And they have complex needs and infrastructure. So they are looking for a bridge. They're not just going to move overnight, and they need to preserve their processes, they need to preserve data. And they cannot disrupt themselves, definitely not through COVID when people are working from home. So they are looking for a partner that can help them navigate through the cloud transition, and help them move to the cloud in a more orderly fashion. And what's interesting about that is, when you look at the 20% cloud revenue growth that we are expecting this year by the end of Q4, and that 20% we mentioned excluding for fee. 15% of that came from new bookings, and only 5% came from conversion of legacy solutions. So that tells you that while they are moving to the cloud, they're not as such moving their legacy because it's working, it's there. They got their datacenters, and there's no reason to disrupt. But they're buying new functionality; they're comfortable buying it in the cloud. And we saw some really great accounts this year. Some of the -- one of the leading food delivery service companies, one of the leading grocery delivery, one of the leading cloud infrastructure companies, these are the new economy companies doing very well with COVID, and expanding. And they chose Verint in the cloud.",Dan Bodner,4393949
,,,,
12534,Question-and-Answer,,Dan Bodner,4393949
,,,,
12535,Question-and-Answer,"So it is easy for new customers to buy in the cloud. It's easy for existing customers to buy new functionality in the cloud. And they are all looking at Verint to help them to migrate their legacy solutions to the cloud over time, and we are ready to help them in all these different scenarios.",Dan Bodner,4393949
,,,,
12536,Question-and-Answer,"Great. And then maybe you can just sort of address in terms of cost structure, and obviously about this, strategically this has been well mapped out for many, many months. But just maybe stranded costs and as well as just plans in place to hit the ground running as soon as this thing gets the green light. Just maybe talk about that, and to sort of preparation from a cost structure perspective.",Daniel Ives,4393949
,,,,
12537,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, so I think we kind of figured out the cost structure we discussed earlier. And clearly, we're provide more details over the next few weeks about the capital structure, how that's going to be allocated, and also in terms of the synergies. We do expect approximately $15 million of separation dissynergies in each company. We expect there to be a one-time step-down which we can grow out of, but there is obviously certain inefficiency with breaking a public company into two public companies, and certainly out of the gate. So, a lot of that has been already I place as we were growing into the separation.",Dan Bodner,4393949
,,,,
12538,Question-and-Answer,"We do expect to have a TSA, a transitional services agreement between the two companies and the reverse TSA as well, so both companies will provide for some time services to each other. But these are relatively small. A lot of the resources already been identified as which one is going to which company. And there is a few million dollars of TSA services that will go back and forth. And of course, we will -- that will decline over time. So we think that we are prepared. We expect to file the document publicly for Cognyte in two weeks. And then, in January, we'll be out there with the management teams of both companies to discuss with investors. I think the investors will meet a lot of new people.",Dan Bodner,4393949
,,,,
12539,Question-and-Answer,"Certainly we have the management team for Cognyte ready, as the management team of the division we're going to have a new board for Cognyte. Three directors from Verint will continue with the Cognyte Board. We are targeting seven directors, so there will be three continuing from Verint, the new CEO, Elad Sharon, will join the Board, and we are looking for three new directors to join the company. So, all that will be kind of folding in January.",Dan Bodner,4393949
,,,,
12540,Question-and-Answer,"Thanks, that's great.",Daniel Ives,4393949
,,,,
12541,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan MacDonald with Needham. Your line is now open.,Operator,4393949
,,,,
12542,Question-and-Answer,"Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking my questions, and congrats on a nice quarter. And appreciate all of the future outlook disclosures as we're looking at these two businesses. I guess as we look into next year and sort of the 30% cloud growth CAGR, what's your expectation in terms of mix of that coming from existing customers versus net new? And how does this program, conversion program that you started in third quarter, how do expect that sort of accelerate that transition as we look into next year?",Ryan MacDonald,4393949
,,,,
12543,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, so imagine before that the 20% this year is 15% from new booking, 5% from conversion. The 30% next year actually is also 15% from new booking, so we're not dialing in a huge growth in new booking relative to what we just did in the COVID year. But the conversion we expect to be 15%, so that's up from 5% to 15%. We launched this new program in Q3. We already saw pickup in Q3, and the beginning of Q4. So, based on the conversion pipeline, I think in the early days of COVID customers hesitated to convert because they were more sensitive to disruption. The new program we introduced, in August, is basically no disruption.",Dan Bodner,4393949
,,,,
12544,Question-and-Answer,,Dan Bodner,4393949
,,,,
12545,Question-and-Answer,"So we allow them -- we created the technology that they could continue to work on premises and test the new product in the cloud [indiscernible], and then just overnight switch over, which was obviously very appealing for anyone that's concerning about operational disruption. So we think the conversion program will pick up next year, and that's about 50-50 between new booking and conversion.",Dan Bodner,4393949
,,,,
12546,Question-and-Answer,"Excellent, that's very helpful. And just curious to get your thoughts on as you've looked over the past month, as we've seen throughout EMEA and a little bit in the U.S., you know, obviously some shutdowns and lockdowns again. How is the environment compared as you're going out and selling to what we saw earlier this year, would you say that businesses are better suited or better prepared? I guess this time around to kind of continue business as usual and sort of sales cycles as usual? Thanks.",Ryan MacDonald,4393949
,,,,
12547,Question-and-Answer,"I think so. I think, look, we have very little exposure to travel industry entertainment, industries that are still suffering from the COVID. In fact our exposure is really, really minimal. So, in the main verticals that we are addressing, this was mostly about on premises deals being affected by travel and just workforce at home and some of the perpetual deals that we had in the pipeline this year move to cloud, but some actually pushed to next year, so they're still in the plan. We do see some on premises deal, so it's getting better, it got better in Q3 and we feel like it's getting better in Q4, but we also see that some of these perpetual deals will come back next year as cloudy. So I would say that, it's not business as usual, but companies are focusing on their priorities, and I think customer engagement is a priority. Having the tools to manage the workforce remotely, and increase automation is a priority, so I think COVID is actually providing us some good tailwind into next year.",Dan Bodner,4393949
,,,,
12548,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. And then, just one final one for me, I'll hop back in the queue. So great to see that you had some nice competitive wins that you announced during the quarter. I'm just curious to see how that competitive environment is evolving and I guess what your thoughts are on the recent announcement of sales force with their own workforce engagement management. I imagine that's likely more of a competitive dynamic down market, but love your thoughts there. Thanks.",Ryan MacDonald,4393949
,,,,
12549,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. So, we're not very competitive with sales force and we also -- which is very powerful, and we also partner with sales force, and we have some products in their marketplace. So, it's a competition with the CRM guys and the [CCAS] [ph] guys, and we clearly see interest from the CCAS vendors to offer business applications like we do. Advanced business applications are critical to our customers and if they're looking to address the workforce dynamics and automation as I mentioned before, some mentors are FM capabilities, but many already partnered with Verint, and many are looking to partner with Verint, due to the strengths that we bring with our leading applications and open platform and apart diagnostic strategy. So, for example, you can -- we find ourself in RFPs, where there could be multiple vendors leading and we are in all of these. And that's great because we don't really care who's going to win.",Dan Bodner,4393949
,,,,
12550,Question-and-Answer,"So the dynamic is such that we think partners are going to be more important and we're not only partnering with the CCAS and collaboration vendors, but we also have regional resellers, and they can resell another vendor in Verint and add value, and very important about the competitive landscape is we saw this year, the system integrators actually are increasing their role as more customers are seeking advice and integration services. And that's obviously, good for Verint because we have an open approach and open platform is an ideal choice for system integrators. So just last -- third point one and we'll talk more in Investor Day about the competitive landscape. But when you look at the Social Security Administration deal that we that we want, this is a Verizon deal, where Verizon is a system integrator for the Social Security. Avaya was chosen as the collaboration platform, and we have the party for choice for the business applications. So I think that's the dynamics. I think customers want to get what they need, and they do it in many different ways. And we think that they did a strong opportunity for growth with a partner agnostic strategy.",Dan Bodner,4393949

12553,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Essex with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.,Operator,4393949
,,,,
12554,Question-and-Answer,"Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question, and congrats from me as well in the quarter. It's nice reacceleration. I was wondering if maybe you could give us a little bit more color on the Cognyte team. I think you mentioned that Elad Sharon would be the new CEO, but how well established is the management team for that business. And is it just personnel, just moving over underneath that umbrella that are already working at the company, or is there a lot of new hiring and reorganization that's going to take place once that spins-off?",Brian Essex,4393949
,,,,
12555,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, so in preparation for this, and as you know, we've been preparing for a long time. We had two objectives. One is we wanted to complete the software model transition and get to the 70% gross margin and positions this company to really focus on growth as a software company. So a lot of effort in strengthening the management team to bring that experience and change the business model. And the second thing is to prepare the company to be an independent public company. And we did it through a combination of promoting people from within and hiring people. I'll just give one example, which we hired -- this year we hired our Chief Product Officer, who is really going to be responsible for the product and go-to-market, and he was -- some year back he was the President of Nice, not in the Cognyte space, in the customer engagement space, but clearly a strong addition to the management team. So I feel like it's a strong team. You're going to meet them on January 11. Unfortunately, it's going to be a virtual day. So, you all going to get a visually, but you definitely get a chance to see the new management team, and part of we want to do is often introduce the spirit of the company and obviously their passion of growing and becoming a very successful pure grace -- company.",Dan Bodner,4393949
,,,,
12556,Question-and-Answer,"Okay, but is that all established at this point, or is there additional transition that needs to happen? I mean, the whole sales organization is that already in place and you're ready to go, or is there more that needs to happen there?",Brian Essex,4393949
,,,,
12557,Question-and-Answer,"So it's on place, sales, services, R&D, management are in place. The only thing is I mentioned before there are some transitional services that they will get from Verint, and it's really an area of some financial advice on public company, readiness, legal advice, IR advice, data function that will be continued to build, during next year, but in terms of the business functions they already in place.",Dan Bodner,4393949
,,,,
12558,Question-and-Answer,"Got it. And, and maybe just to follow-up, any update on Apax and where they stand with regard to the second tranche after the spin, it looks like we're above, I think it was a $50 floor on the collar here. Any expectations around that, and we don't particularly with regard to your capital structure expectations going forward?",Brian Essex,4393949
,,,,
12559,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, I believe from memory that the threshold was $48, but -- so please to have them joining the company, they have a one designated board member as part of tranche 2, we agreed that we will add another board member that is jointly agreeable to Apax and Verint and independent board member. And in terms of the capital structure, maybe I'll turn it over to Doug, just to say a few words on capital allocation. Doug?",Dan Bodner,4393949
,,,,
12560,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, sure. Hi, Brian. Yes, so we expect the Apax second tranche provided makes a threshold to be funded sometime in Q1. And it's just subject to the closing conditions that we previously had shared with folks. In terms of use of that cash, general corporate purposes, or perhaps applying it to the outstanding debt, we'll outline better for you at the Investor Day, the capital structures, but Cognyte is being spun debt free, we keep them with adequate working capital, apply excess cash to bring the debt down, and try to be sensitive to not too much leverage on the CES if you will side of the business. So we would expect debt-to-EBITDA ratio was one-ish or so, on that business. So, we just have some cash to move around. We're doing that as part of the spin structure or lying the legal entities. We'll take you through all that in a little more detail when we have our Investor Days.",Doug Robinson,4393949

,,,,
12565,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, thanks for taking my question. So, it sounds like it has some TSA arrangements in place for a period as the two companies go through the separation, but are there any other relationships that will last beyond the separation date meaning for instance, is there any commonality in the board? Is there any cross licensing, or is the separation otherwise completely clear?",Paul Coster,4393949
,,,,
12566,Question-and-Answer,"There shouldn't be any other relationship, other than TSA in terms of board's crossover, we expect two people to be on both boards. That's two out of seven from Cognyte. So that that's I think is important for continuity. But that's the end of it.",Doug Robinson,4393949
,,,,
12567,Question-and-Answer,"There won't be any constraints imposed on Cognyte from the perspective of selling the business, for instance, that obligations that are due to Verint in the future?",Paul Coster,4393949

12570,Question-and-Answer,Verint imposed any obligations or restrictions on the Cognyte business.,Doug Robinson,4393949
,,,,
12571,Question-and-Answer,"Okay, great. Your cloud business is accelerating, which is very welcome. It's accelerating a little bit after some of your peers? Why did that happen? Why is it that you're experiencing this strength a little bit later than everyone else? What's the cause of the phasing here, Dan?",Paul Coster,4393949
,,,,
12572,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, so I think we actually had the peers. So it depends on what you would refer to as peers. And they are the collaboration and communication platforms, right. And we know that there are about 100 companies now that have CCAS or UCAS or so some sort of collaboration platform in the cloud. And I think the space of vision has accelerated in its transition to the cloud. It's very much an IT infrastructure change from collaboration platform or what used to be unified communication platform right now. Now, it's called collaboration. It's pretty much an IT change to the cloud, which was accelerated for a lot of good reasons. But the business applications that we sell, we feel like we're ahead, even and of close to better in terms of how much we move to the cloud. It's really worth the market adoption. Again, this application requires companies to change more than IT to change processes and so on and they were slowing, slowing adoption. We talked before about the fact that we know we sell across the enterprise, not just enter. We saw for example, in our branch business, there was a lot of adoption to cloud adoption solution, we sell to the marketing department, almost entirely cloud, and then back office and some contact center, we saw that the market was lower. But all that is, I think is history because whether it was COVID, or whether it was just natural evolution, it looks like this year, the market was ready and we're ready. So we're moving from one-third mix to last year to half this year to two-thirds, which we feel we can achieve next year. I think that's the face that we were hoping to get before, but we get it now.",Dan Bodner,4393949
,,,,
12573,Question-and-Answer,"Got it and my last question and on the Cyber Intel front, you had three deals. Do these deals have similar characteristics or were they diverse from the perspective of geography and",Paul Coster,4393949
,,,,
12574,Question-and-Answer,application?,Paul Coster,4393949
,,,,
12575,Question-and-Answer,"No, I don't see anything unusual. Largely usually represent customers by more than one functionality. That's why it becomes larger. So they can bundle several things they need into a bigger contract. But I think what we see across the deals, including the large deals is the trends that we were hoping to see, which is less hardware, I think a hardware was less than $5 million in Q3. Very small, less services with not just hardware declined, but services declined because of the investment we did in productizing. And we also, customers can do more the services themselves. So the mix is changing across the big deals as well, towards the softer mix. We had a 74% gross margin in Q3, but that was probably a little bit of an anomaly. So we only expect 70% for the full-year, but this was 66% last year and 62% the year before. So very quick shift, and we'll continue to improve the gross margin beyond 70%. But obviously, the big acceleration is behind us. And I think from now, we'll see some more modest margin expansion. When we talk about growth for next year, we expect some margin expansion as well. And we hope to target growth rates in subsequent years as an independent company.",Dan Bodner,4393949

,,,,
12579,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, thanks for taking my questions. So, Doug, you mentioned some COVID delayed federal license orders, obviously not impacting the numbers or outlook, but could you expand on those comments? Now maybe quantify the impact, what you're seeing in federal or status of those steals?",Dan Bergstrom,4393949
,,,,
12580,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, sure. I mean, so all year, we've seen impacts from COVID. As you know in the beginning of the year, we felt we couldn't provide guidance because of that. But as we've gone through the year, I think everyone's learned to kind of work remotely our customers functioning better, we're getting more, I think comfortable with ongoing nature of the business and making better commitments. We're hoping perpetual licenses start to get a little bit more on track into next year. I think that was a large impact, but largely, the plans haven't changed, or customers have a lot to do. They know, they have to do it. I think as Dan mentioned several times, COVID certainly has kind of woken people up as to the need to get to more of an infrastructure in the cloud that's more straightforward, accessible, et cetera. So, it's hard to quantify it, right, because, deals slide and they're smaller and COVID behind a lot of that. But we do see just continual improvement in the overall business environment as people are coping with COVID better. And that's the reason for getting back to guidance and providing some outlook for next year in longer-term.",Doug Robinson,4393949

,,,,
12592,Presentation,I would now like to turn the conference call over to Neil Rossy.,Operator,4393933
,,,,
12593,Presentation,"Thank you, operator and good morning, everyone. We are very pleased with our strong performance in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 with a double-digit increase in sales, strong same-store sales growth and earnings per share, as well as an industry-leading gross margin.",Neil Rossy,4393933
,,,,
12594,Presentation,Our solid results reflect the enduring strength and relevance of our business model and the important role we continue to play as a provider of essential goods during the pandemic. Our affordable everyday product offering coupled with the proximity and convenience we offer Canadian consumers continue to resonate. Our performance also reflects our team's disciplined execution in maintaining well-stocked stores and offering a safe and efficient in-store shopping experience.,Neil Rossy,4393933
,,,,
12595,Presentation,"Strong sales in the third quarter were boosted by higher demand for seasonal products as well as certain all year categories, including household and cleaning products. Despite stay-at-home directions, social distancing measures and in-store capacity limits in various provinces, we saw a lot of customers looking to safely celebrate Halloween this year, even if that meant staying within their household bubbles to do so.",Neil Rossy,4393933
,,,,
12596,Presentation,,Neil Rossy,4393933
,,,,
12597,Presentation,We also picked up a lot of summer sales in the quarter further contributing to our strong results. The popularity of seasonal and festive items in the third quarter is a positive trend as we enter the seasonally-important fourth quarter. SSS growth was very strong and continues to be shaped by evolving shopping patterns.,Neil Rossy,4393933
,,,,
12598,Presentation,"This quarter we saw a strong basket balanced with further improvement in traffic compared to Q2, when a number of our stores were temporarily closed or still operating with reduced hours. Store hours are currently back to normal with the exception of some mall stores, which continue to experience much lower traffic than the rest of the chain.",Neil Rossy,4393933
,,,,
12599,Presentation,"In Q4 to-date, basket size remains large compared to pre-pandemic levels and traffic continues to pick up compared to Q3, but a lot can happen in the very crucial next two weeks of holiday shopping.",Neil Rossy,4393933
,,,,
12600,Presentation,"Coming back to Q3, higher sales of seasonal merchandise also resulted in a favorable sales mix in terms of gross margin. We continue to invest in COVID-19 measures to maintain safe operations for our employees and a safe in-store shopping experience for our customers.",Neil Rossy,4393933
,,,,
12601,Presentation,"Since March, we have invested over $60 million in direct incremental COVID-19 costs. In Q3, these amounted to $10.9 million and SG&A costs for additional in-store hours for the execution of sanitizing and cleaning tasks. We also continue to support and recognize our employees who play the most important role in our continued success and in our ability to provide Canadian families with access to affordable everyday goods throughout the pandemic.",Neil Rossy,4393933
,,,,
12602,Presentation,"In this context, we were pleased to announce today a bonus payment for all store employees to show them our gratitude and to thank them for their continued hard work and dedication. Full-time employees will receive a $300 bonus and part-time employees will receive a $200 bonus. All active store employees as of today's date will receive this one-time gratitude bonus. Thank you all for your incredible work.",Neil Rossy,4393933
,,,,
12603,Presentation,"While store teams delivered strong merchandising and sales execution in the quarter, our real estate team also pressed ahead, opening 19 net new stores during the quarter. This brings the total number of stores opened in the last nine months to 42. Based on where we stand today, we are on track to open 60 to 65 net new stores by year-end. But as you know, many factors are outside of our control due to COVID-19 and the situation can change quickly. The important thing to note is that if we do not hit the 60 to 65 net new store mark by fiscal year-end, it will be due to timing and not lost opportunity.",Neil Rossy,4393933
,,,,
12604,Presentation,"In the quarter, we also conducted one of our periodic customer surveys to keep a pulse on the market and to ensure that we are continuously delivering on what matters most to Canadian consumers. The findings of this fall survey reinforced the confidence we have in the core tenets of our business model, offering a wide range of affordable everyday products, providing outstanding convenience through our 1,300 plus locations and delivering compelling value that appeals to Canadians from all walks of life. While many customers have adapted their shopping patterns during the pandemic, our customers remain highly loyal to Dollarama, and we have continued to expand our appeal to new customers.",Neil Rossy,4393933
,,,,
12605,Presentation,"Turning now to our activities in Latin America. We saw a strong equity contribution of $4.3 million from Dollar City for the quarter stemming from their third quarter ended September 30. As of this date, all Dollar City stores are open and only 15 are operating with reduced hours. Most COVID-19-related restrictions have been lifted in our countries of operation, namely Colombia, El Salvador, and Guatemala resulting in increased customer traffic. While the situation there has improved dramatically during the spring ? since the spring, we continue to monitor it carefully.",Neil Rossy,4393933
,,,,
12606,Presentation,,Neil Rossy,4393933
,,,,
12607,Presentation,"After pressing pause on new store openings due to COVID-19, eight net new Dollar City stores were open in their last quarter, primarily in Colombia bringing the total count to 240. This is a step in the right direction as we resume our growth.",Neil Rossy,4393933
,,,,
12608,Presentation,"We are also pleased to confirm that we will be entering the Peruvian market, Peru being one of the nine countries covered by our agreement with Dollar City. As mentioned in the past, Peru was identified early in the process as our next country of entry, given the favorable trends there in terms of consumer profile, market dynamics, competitive landscape and appetite for our value-oriented retail model.",Neil Rossy,4393933
,,,,
12609,Presentation,"We expect to open our first stores there as early as the first calendar quarter of 2021, barring factors outside of our control. As with everything we do, we will proceed prudently as we test our concepts in this new country. Near-term growth will continue to be driven primarily by Colombia and we will only revisit our long-term growth target of 600 stores by 2029 once we have established a firm foothold in this new country of operation. But certainly, we are excited by the additional growth potential this market can bring.",Neil Rossy,4393933
,,,,
12610,Presentation,"Finally, Dollar City office started to roll out items at price points equivalent to US$3.50 and US$4 in Colombia only in November, which we expect will be well-received by customers. There are no immediate plans to roll out these additional price points in the other Dollar City countries of operation for the time being, but this will be reassessed at a later date.",Neil Rossy,4393933
,,,,
12611,Presentation,"Overall, we are extremely pleased with Dollar City's progress. The business showed great resilience during the pandemic, increasing brand awareness and winning over new customers as a result of its recognition as an essential business in all three countries of operations. And the team continues to build up the operational capacity to support Dollar City's long-term profitable growth.",Neil Rossy,4393933
,,,,
12612,Presentation,"With that, I'll hand it over to Michael for a closer look at our financial results before providing some concluding remarks. Michael, over to you.",Neil Rossy,4393933
,,,,
12613,Presentation,"Thank you, Neil, and good morning, everyone. So sales for Q3 increased by 12.3% to $1.06 billion driven by a higher overall store count and 7.1% same-store sales growth. Same-store sales results were comprised of a 26.3% increase in the average ticket and a 15.2% decrease in the number of transactions. Neil provided some color in this regard, but the key takeaway here is that we are seeing some positive trends in traffic from quarter-to-quarter, while the basket remains very strong.",Michael Ross,4393933
,,,,
12614,Presentation,"Looking at outline sales, while they remain non-material ? online sales, sorry, while they remain non-material to the ? our overall sales, these also continue to see a strong increase and we are pleased with the progression. Gross margin was 44% of sales in Q3 this year, up from 43.7% last year, as a result of increased sales of higher margin seasonal products and positive effect of scaling due to higher sales.",Michael Ross,4393933
,,,,
12615,Presentation,"G&A was 15.1% of sales compared to 15% in fiscal 2020. This variance reflects incremental costs of $10.9 million related to additional hours for in-store cleaning and sanitizing measures. These costs had a 100 basis point impact on the quarter. G&A was positively impacted by higher labor productivity in stores due to the processing of a lower volume of transactions by higher baskets, less packaway of seasonal inventory as a result of strong sales, lower travel costs, as well as scaling.",Michael Ross,4393933
,,,,
12616,Presentation,"EBITDA was $312.1 million, representing 29.3% of sales, net earnings were $161.9 million, and diluted earnings per share was $0.52, a 18.2% increase compared to Q3 last year. Cash flows from operating activities totaled $201 million compared to $203 million in Q3 last year. Cash flows from higher earnings were partially offset by tax installment payments deferred early in the year as permitted by CRA in the context of the pandemic.",Michael Ross,4393933
,,,,
12617,Presentation,,Michael Ross,4393933
,,,,
12618,Presentation,"Inventory levels decreased in the quarter as a result of strong sales and the timing in receiving merchandise. To compensate, we've been accelerating our replenishment cycles and drawing down on safety stocks, reflecting the strength and flexibility of our supply chain and procurement operations. Also keep in mind that due to timing, inventory levels were on the high side in Q3 of last year. Despite inventories being on the lean side, stores are well-stocked with all year and seasonal items, and we expect to meet anticipated customer demand in the upcoming quarters.",Michael Ross,4393933
,,,,
12619,Presentation,"Looking at transformation projects. We also continue to roll out self-checkouts in certain high traffic locations. We are on track to have self-checkouts in about 200 stores by fiscal year-end with about 175 stores with self-checkouts at quarter-end. Wherever we offer self-checkouts, it's always in combination with traditional checkouts and this additional convenience is achieving our topline objective, which is to help accelerate the queue line in high traffic stores.",Michael Ross,4393933
,,,,
12620,Presentation,"In terms of capital allocation, the Board approved a 6.8% increase in the quarterly dividend from $0.044 to $0.047 per share. We did not repurchase any shares during the third quarter, again, in order to preserve liquidity and at quarter-end, our leverage ratio stood at 2.7x adjusted net debt to EBITDA. This is 24 basis points below our 2.94x leverage ratio at the end of fiscal 2020, which provides us with a lot of flexibility as we look to resume our buyback activities before the end of the fiscal year.",Michael Ross,4393933
,,,,
12621,Presentation,"Barring factors outside of our control due to COVID-19, it is our intention to actively resume such activities during the fourth quarter while maintaining our leverage ratio in our comfort zone of between 2.75x and 3x adjusted net debt to EBITDA.",Michael Ross,4393933
,,,,
12622,Presentation,"Looking at our debt structure, we closed a new bond financing in Q3 with $300 million seven-year fixed rate note at a rate of 1.505% to take advantage of favorable market conditions ahead of the upcoming maturity of a $300 million floating rate note in February 2021, and further solidify our capital structure.",Michael Ross,4393933
,,,,
12623,Presentation,So I'll now hand it over to Neil for the concluding remarks.,Michael Ross,4393933
,,,,
12624,Presentation,"Thank you, Michael. Our strong Q3 results reflected the strength and relevance of our business model and strong value proposition to Canadian consumers who are looking for affordability, proximity and convenience as the pandemic persists. Historically, Q4 is our most important sales quarter and December is our most important sales month. We entered the final quarter of the fiscal year with a good tailwind from Q3, momentum on the seasonal product sales front and 1,333 stores ready to safely serve customers from coast-to-coast.",Neil Rossy,4393933
,,,,
12625,Presentation,"Of course, the next two weeks are hugely important to our fourth quarter sales historically, and communities across the country are grappling with the pandemic second wave. Since November, provincial governments have been ramping up measures and increasing restrictions to address rising caseloads as we bide time until the availability of an effective vaccine.",Neil Rossy,4393933
,,,,
12626,Presentation,"This includes restrictions on the sale of non-essential items in the province of Manitoba since November 20, where we have just under 40 stores. Such restrictions impact sales, but they are also bring their fair share of execution challenges. We are also seeing a tightening of in-store capacity limits in many other jurisdictions and approach we endorse and have used proactively across the network. But that also continues to negatively impact customer traffic, especially during a historically busy holiday shopping season.",Neil Rossy,4393933
,,,,
12627,Presentation,"As a provider of essential goods, our stores remain open from coast-to-coast to serve Canadian families, but the restrictions in place and the potential for additional ones could further impact shopping patterns and our financial performance for the remainder of the quarter.",Neil Rossy,4393933
,,,,
12628,Presentation,,Neil Rossy,4393933
,,,,
12629,Presentation,"Our focus is on serving our customers safely and keeping our stores well-stocked with the essential products consumers need. We will continue to monitor the situation closely and we will adjust as needed as we have shown we can since the beginning of the pandemic. We will continue to execute our plan and deliver on what matters most to Canadian consumers. As validated by our most recent survey, we also remain confident that our value proposition will remain a winning one once the pandemic is behind us and that we are very well positioned for the months and years ahead.",Neil Rossy,4393933
,,,,
12630,Presentation,That concludes our formal remarks. I will now turn it over to the operator for questions from financial analysts. Thank you.,Neil Rossy,4393933
,,,,
12631,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. We will now take questions from the telephone lines. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Irene Nattel of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.,Operator,4393933
,,,,
12632,Question-and-Answer,"Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Neil, just following on that last comment of yours about the perception study, can you provide us just with a little bit of color around how that sort of the results of this one might have compared to the prior one in terms of product offering relevant to price points and value please?",Irene Nattel,4393933
,,,,
12633,Question-and-Answer,"Sure. It essentially found the same things as it did last time, which is that our customers appreciate the continued relative value that we offer compared to our competitors that the low range of price points continues to be important to them and they recognize how we are a discount retailer. And convenience, of course, is more and more important as time goes on. The fact that we are adding stores and bringing our offering closer to each customer across the country continues to be something very much appreciated by our consumers.",Neil Rossy,4393933
,,,,
12634,Question-and-Answer,"And is there any change because I remember in prior surveys, it was a one to two relationship. Has there been any change in that Neil in terms of price perception?",Irene Nattel,4393933
,,,,
12635,Question-and-Answer,"We don't disclose that level of detail. I'm sorry, Irene.",Neil Rossy,4393933
,,,,
12636,Question-and-Answer,Okay.,Irene Nattel,4393933
,,,,
12637,Question-and-Answer,I always follow my CFOs lead.,Neil Rossy,4393933
,,,,
12638,Question-and-Answer,"No, not really. You don't have to Neil, and he is leading in everything. So come on. Yes, that?s really nice.",Irene Nattel,4393933
,,,,
12639,Question-and-Answer,I am not.,Neil Rossy,4393933
,,,,
12640,Question-and-Answer,"Sorry, just another question, if I may. With almost 74% of your sales in the quarter at price points above $1.25, can you update us on your thoughts around higher price points possibly?",Irene Nattel,4393933
,,,,
12641,Question-and-Answer,"Sure. So my thoughts are that we remain steadfast in our original philosophy, which was a higher price points, namely $4.50 and $5 or other price points that might be considered in the future are still exactly that, they're considerations for the future. We're convinced that our customers would be happy to receive those price points, but we're not ready to add any price points for the time being.",Neil Rossy,4393933
,,,,
12642,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. And just one final one, please. Q4, certainly what we've heard from other retailers is that Christmas shopping has started earlier. When you look at the cadence of sell-through this year versus last, would you agree with that statement as it applies to Dollarama?",Irene Nattel,4393933
,,,,
12643,Question-and-Answer,"Irene, so it's me. I'm still here.",Michael Ross,4393933
,,,,
12644,Question-and-Answer,Thank you.,Irene Nattel,4393933
,,,,
12645,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. I'll add to that. So yes, so what we're seeing essentially in Q4, we see the same momentum we had as of Q3 for sales and margin so ? in November, so we just finished November, entering December. So the momentum was very good. And you're right, in Q3, we did see some buying ? advanced buying of Christmas items. However, just to bring the proper tone to Q4, as you all know that this past week, the provincial governments across the country have imposed more restrictions on store capacity.",Michael Ross,4393933
,,,,
12646,Question-and-Answer,"And traffic was improved over from Q2 to Q3 and continued to improve in November in Q4. But these recent restrictions are impacting traffic a bit. So this is all evolving on a daily basis. Alberta yesterday ? just yesterday announced, it?s reducing further its capacity in-store. So this is having some impact. We still have two weeks to go to Christmas, so we'll see. But for the time being, we're happy with what we see for Q4.",Michael Ross,4393933
,,,,
12647,Question-and-Answer,,Michael Ross,4393933
,,,,
12648,Question-and-Answer,That's great. Thank you.,Irene Nattel,4393933
,,,,
12649,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. The next question is from Mark Petrie of CIBC. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.,Operator,4393933
,,,,
12650,Question-and-Answer,"Hey. Good morning. I just wanted to follow-up on that last topic, Michael. And specifically with regards to the comment around basket size, you said that it remains elevated and strong. But we typically are seeing an inverse relationship between traffic and basket. So is it reasonable to assume that as traffic continues to recover, basket has subsided or has basket sort of remained at a level of somewhat consistent to Q3 even as traffic has improved?",Mark Petrie,4393933
,,,,
12651,Question-and-Answer,"No. You're absolutely right. There's a relationship between both. So as traffic increases basket decreases and vice versa. So that's what we've noticed. So up till the end of November, that's ? like I said, exactly what happened. So your traffic improved and basket decrease was offset a bit. Now for the past week, we know traffic is impacted, I don't know how basket is going to react, but we know that it's very recent that traffic is impacted by the imposed constraints.",Michael Ross,4393933
,,,,
12652,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. Understood. Okay. Thank you. And I just wanted to ask sort of more broadly, I mean, obviously, the entire concept of Dollarama fits very well with the consumer focused on value and looking for savings. But just wondering if you are approaching your assortment differently at all in terms of the distribution of goods across price points. And then I guess ? well, yes, I?ll leave it at that and then I have a follow-up.",Mark Petrie,4393933
,,,,
12653,Question-and-Answer,"Actually what we've always tried to do philosophically is to offer any given range of goods in a variety of price points. So for example, I'll take hand sanitizers. We'll try to have hand sanitizers in formats that fit the $1 ? $1.25 price point range, the $2 range, the $3 range and the $4 range. And we'll apply that same concept across as many categories across the store as possible just so that we can address different customer needs, sometimes that's just a format change, sometimes it's a size change or a quantity change.",Neil Rossy,4393933
,,,,
12654,Question-and-Answer,"But we do believe that there are consumers that rely on us for things at the very lowest end of our price point range and others who rely on us for things at the higher price point range. And then obviously the nature of the goods dictates in some cases, whether those goods will be at one end or the other.",Neil Rossy,4393933
,,,,
12655,Question-and-Answer,"Thanks. I guess, just a follow-up on that. But you're not seeing anything in terms of consumer demand across that sort of spectrum of good, better, best, or however you want to describe it. I guess it's not really that. It's just sort of across price points. But you're not seeing any sort of evolution in the demand across those price points that would cause you to skew your typical balance or the balance that you've had through fiscal 2021 so far?",Mark Petrie,4393933
,,,,
12656,Question-and-Answer,"No. Nothing that would be consumer-driven. Those changes at times are driven by costs, of course. And so I'd love to have everything in the store to dollar still, but that's just not the world we live in now. And so sometimes those price points are a reflection of the reality of costs that all retailers have to face and therefore all consumers have to face as well. But no, the answer to your question specifically is no.",Neil Rossy,4393933
,,,,
12657,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. Thanks. And then just sort of last one, I guess, related, I think I know the answer again, but just to follow-up. In the past, you've had sort of shifts in assortments, I guess, specifically towards consumables. I think last time we talked about it, you guys were pretty happy with the mix across categories. Is that still the case or are you adjusting sort of mix across categories at all?",Mark Petrie,4393933
,,,,
12658,Question-and-Answer,"No. We are happy with the mix. I mean, obviously right now there's a focus on the essential goods and making sure that we're doing as good a job as possible for our consumers to have the greatest selection that we can in terms of sanitizers, in terms of cleaning, in terms of personal care. But other than that COVID-related focus right now to ensure that we are doing our jobs from an essential service point of view, the balance of our assortment is pretty stable.",Neil Rossy,4393933
,,,,
12659,Question-and-Answer,,Neil Rossy,4393933
,,,,
12660,Question-and-Answer,Okay. Appreciate all the comments and all the best over the holiday.,Mark Petrie,4393933
,,,,
12661,Question-and-Answer,Thank you.,Neil Rossy,4393933
,,,,
12662,Question-and-Answer,Thank you.,Michael Ross,4393933
,,,,
12663,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. The next question is from Chris Li of Desjardins. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.,Operator,4393933
,,,,
12664,Question-and-Answer,"Good morning, Neil and Michael. Neil, first of all, just going back to the perception survey, I think you mentioned in your opening remarks that you've also found that you guys are expanding your appeal to new customers. Just wondering what is the typical profile of these new customers that you are attracting?",Christopher Li,4393933
,,,,
12665,Question-and-Answer,"There's no specificity to that appeal. We're attracting new customers from all ranges of life, age and socioeconomically. So there's not been a specific target group nor a group that happens to have been more representative than the others. It's a general appeal equally across categories.",Neil Rossy,4393933
,,,,
12666,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. That's helpful. And maybe related to that. Obviously, the Dollarama?s product assortment and compelling price points are driving more consumers to consolidate the shopping trips and that that's benefiting your sales. I guess my question is just based on your survey and your conversation with customers, do you think this will continue for a while even after the pandemic is under control or like would consumer continue to consolidate the shopping trips even when we returned to a more normalized environment?",Christopher Li,4393933
,,,,
12667,Question-and-Answer,"I wish I could tell you I was that smart to know the answer to your question, but I'll be honest I would be guessing and I don't want to guess.",Neil Rossy,4393933
,,,,
12668,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. No problem. And maybe just another one, just on the ? what we're seeing in some of the other retail channels is, there's a migration to consumers buying larger pack sizes just because the nature of the times here. Is there an opportunity for you guys to maybe offer larger pack sizes perhaps at a higher price points that will be sort of your way of introducing higher price point at some point in the future?",Christopher Li,4393933
,,,,
12669,Question-and-Answer,"I think our way to address your question is with our e-com proposals. So the reason we built our e-com platform was to address consumers who wanted to buy larger quantities of our current assortment. And since in our stores, we can't sell goods in a different price range than the one we've chosen to be focused on if those consumers want to buy a larger amount of those goods in a simple fashion that's basically why we built our e-com platform.",Neil Rossy,4393933
,,,,
12670,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just a couple of quick ones for Michael. Michael, do you think you guys will be in a position to start providing guidance again next quarter?",Christopher Li,4393933
,,,,
12671,Question-and-Answer,"Well for the time being just predicting this quarter is a challenge again, so I don't know. We'll have to see. And historically, we've been as transparent as we could and that's still the intention. And so we don't want to pretend we know stuff that we don't, so we'll see for next year. But what I can tell you today is that there's nothing going on structurally around us that would have us change our business model.",Michael Ross,4393933
,,,,
12672,Question-and-Answer,"It's all about relative value. We continue monitoring costs, the activities. We've demonstrated our agility. Our ability to manage the margins, look at this year, at the opening of the year, we gave you a bit of color less than the prior years, but at least ? and we alter that color we gave you in terms of margins and things like that. So we'll see in next Q4 and we have the ability to manage our margins through the refresh. That hasn't changed ? through markup processes, that hasn't changed. So that's what we can confirm to you today. But for next year, I think we just will have to wait.",Michael Ross,4393933
,,,,
12673,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. That's very helpful. And just maybe a quick one on the margins. The Canadian dollar has been quite strong lately and you guys see persist into next year, like just overall, would that be a tailwind for your margins for next year?",Christopher Li,4393933
,,,,
12674,Question-and-Answer,,Christopher Li,4393933
,,,,
12675,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. So that's one component and you've got inflation from shipping and from buying. So I mean, there's a lot of movement and there are many factors involved. So I just don't want to comment and say and miss guide you, but you're absolutely right. From a currency standpoint, the currency ? the Canadian currency is reinforcing. That's definitely helping the margin.",Michael Ross,4393933
,,,,
12676,Question-and-Answer,Great. And then my last question just on the SG&A line. The corporate cost of $11 million were a little bit lower than I think what you were sort of guiding last quarter. Anything going on there? And is the $11 million this quarter a good runway for in the near future?,Christopher Li,4393933
,,,,
12677,Question-and-Answer,"No. It continues to be ? the costs are more or less the same, a bit lower, but essentially it's the same quality of protection that's where we're looking for. So we're definitely ? and even, I would say those protocols are accentuated with the traffic that increases. So I would say that will definitely ? that continues in Q4 should be in the similar range. And over and above that we have announced. As you know, Neil went through that, a gratitude remuneration. And so that will be added over and above the normal COVID cost that you've seen in Q3 should be similar-ish in Q4.",Michael Ross,4393933
,,,,
12678,Question-and-Answer,Great. Have a great and joyful holiday and all the best next year. And then Michael congrats on your well deserved retirement.,Christopher Li,4393933
,,,,
12679,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. Thank you very much.,Michael Ross,4393933
,,,,
12680,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. The next question is from Peter Sklar of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.,Operator,4393933
,,,,
12681,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. Thanks. Michael, you've talked in the past how ? like you look at other retailers that you consider to be your competitors and you won't take price unless they're taking price because you want to maintain your competitive position. So over the last number of quarters, that's been one of the topics that Dollarama has not been taking in-store price increases. Is that situation changed at all? Or is it the same? Are you able to put through some price?",Peter Sklar,4393933
,,,,
12682,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. But like we said at the beginning of the year and through the quarters, it's more or less in line with what we had last year. So in other words, not that much, but we are definitely, and this is done by the buying team on an ongoing basis and that's what we do at Dollarama is compare and make sure that we are competitive. But in terms of markups, it?s similar ? very similar to last year i.e. not that many.",Michael Ross,4393933
,,,,
12683,Question-and-Answer,And who do you consider to be your competitive backdrop? Is it still Walmart drug stores? Is that the universe you look at?,Peter Sklar,4393933
,,,,
12684,Question-and-Answer,"We look at all universes to be honest. We consider everybody to be our competition. And so we'll shop the entire market from the smallest stores to the largest stores and everyone in between. And truthfully, I think that all retailers, whether they say it or not do the same thing. But we really do think that when we talk about being the best relative value in the market, we want to be the best relative value in the entire market. And we understand that sometimes on any given day or any given item that might not be the case, but we'd like to try to make it the case every day on every item.",Neil Rossy,4393933
,,,,
12685,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. And Neil, like I believe that your buyers traditionally go to China, that's where you source the majority of your products. So how does that work in COVID? Are your buyers still able to go or do they just buy off of catalogs from Canada? How has COVID impacted your ability to procure?",Peter Sklar,4393933
,,,,
12686,Question-and-Answer,"It's very difficult not just for us, but for any importer anywhere in the world. And nobody is going to China right now. You require special permits to get into the country and in any area that you go to, you'd have to quarantine in each area for two weeks, and it's just entirely impractical.",Neil Rossy,4393933
,,,,
12687,Question-and-Answer,,Neil Rossy,4393933
,,,,
12688,Question-and-Answer,"And the truth is that because of COVID being a global challenge, the amount of creativity and new molds and new ideas being generated in China for the balance of the world is also at a low so to speak. So even if we could go, the environment is entirely different right now. The entire planet is focused on staying healthy, the essentials plus of course, some everyday goods. But relative to when the world is booming, the amount of new things being created and people's mindset being put on new and exciting items is entirely different than it is now as you can imagine. So there wouldn't be the same experience if one could go shopping around the world right now for everyday goods.",Neil Rossy,4393933
,,,,
12689,Question-and-Answer,"That being said, the show goes on. And so it's our job to make sure that we have open lines of communication with all of our vendors around the world, including China, but also in Europe and also in the States and in Mexico and on and on. And we are doing a lot of video conferencing, which is not nearly as efficient, of course, as being somewhere in person. And so much more time is being spent doing what can be done more efficiently in person, but it is what it is. And everybody has to contend with the same challenges.",Neil Rossy,4393933
,,,,
12690,Question-and-Answer,"And at the end of the day, as you well know, we live in a market where everybody has to deal with the same situation. And so the question is just who's working the hardest and the most focused on providing what it is that they're trying to do for their customers. And so our job is to remain ultimately focused on great value and at the best possible quality and the price ranges that we sell and we're using every means and method that we can to find those goods for our customer at this point in time. But there's no question that it is far more challenging than it was historically by the same token. What's really everyone's focus right now is more on the essential goods.",Neil Rossy,4393933
,,,,
12691,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. And then just one final question. When you talked about the consumer survey, I believe the point you were making is that consumers are increasingly value convenience. I assume that means convenience of store location, how close the store is to them and does have parking access that kind of thing. So I'm just wondering in that context, has that changed your thinking at all about your aspirational targets for the number of stores Dollarama could have in Canada. I believe, officially based on some consultant you use, you're at 1,700 store count is your aspiration in Canada. But I'm just wondering Neil, your feelings have changed about that.",Peter Sklar,4393933
,,,,
12692,Question-and-Answer,"No. I think it's totally in line with our historical philosophy that we'd like to keep putting as many stores as we can over the course of time in a thoughtful manner, that's cost effective. And so every year, you've seen that very steady rollout of 60 to 65 stores over the course of time, every one of them taking into account the cost of the leases, the locations, the cannibalization, and all the other opportunities. But our goal has been and remains what it has truthfully for 20-plus years, which is to have over the course of time as many stores as possible. That makes sense economically for our customers to have a store as close to them as possible.",Neil Rossy,4393933
,,,,
12693,Question-and-Answer,Okay.,Peter Sklar,4393933
,,,,
12694,Question-and-Answer,"And just to maybe add to that. So we ? normally we update you with the amounts, the 10-year forecast, we?re supposed to do that this year. We put it on pause because of the COVID situation. So post-COVID once all of this is behind us, we will communicate that to you, and we hope that things track like they are tracking right now.",Michael Ross,4393933
,,,,
12695,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. Thanks, Michael.",Peter Sklar,4393933
,,,,
12696,Question-and-Answer,All right.,Michael Ross,4393933
,,,,
12697,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. The next question is from Vishal Shreedhar of National Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.,Operator,4393933
,,,,
12698,Question-and-Answer,,Vishal Shreedhar,4393933
,,,,
12699,Question-and-Answer,"Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping to give this question in terms of perspective on mall performance and non-mall performance or maybe even traffic, if you're able to provide any color on that?",Vishal Shreedhar,4393933
,,,,
12700,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. So mall stores continue to be impacted by lower traffic. So it has improved slightly over the time, but it's still a concern. And so that's been the case throughout the year up to-date.",Michael Ross,4393933
,,,,
12701,Question-and-Answer,Okay. Are there any numbers you can provide or are the mall stores positive in terms of comp or?,Vishal Shreedhar,4393933
,,,,
12702,Question-and-Answer,"No, we're not disclosing any specifics on that information. And sometimes traffic is lower in certain malls, but picked up by other stores that are in strips or around those. So there's a lot ? too much noise in there to start trying to communicate that.",Michael Ross,4393933
,,,,
12703,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. And in terms of momentum through the quarter, obviously the traffic trend improved. Should we also read that to suggest that the overall same-store improves through the quarter?",Vishal Shreedhar,4393933
,,,,
12704,Question-and-Answer,"The overall ? what ? I?m sorry, I missed that Vishal.",Michael Ross,4393933
,,,,
12705,Question-and-Answer,"Sorry, same-store sales growth. Did that improved as well through the quarter?",Vishal Shreedhar,4393933
,,,,
12706,Question-and-Answer,"Well, no, I'm not going to go there. But all I said was that we had very ? same good momentum we had in Q3 in November, first month of the quarter and traffic continuing to improve. But as we said, the trends are usually when traffic improves, basket ticket reduces, but overall ? and as well as for the margins, so things ? we're happy with what we see and that's as far as I'll go.",Michael Ross,4393933
,,,,
12707,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. And with respect to the elevated seasonal sales and the benefit on gross margin rates, obviously next year Dollarama will lap hopefully the unusual COVID situation at this time. And I was hoping to maybe get a little perspective on to what degree the gross margin rates were elevated by elevated seasonal sales. Is that's something that you can shed some light on?",Vishal Shreedhar,4393933
,,,,
12708,Question-and-Answer,"No. That would be too much detailed information. But I mean, you're right to say that Halloween went well. Christmas, we've yet ? the two biggest weeks are in front of us. So we'll see. Summer season was very strong. Easter was very poor. Souvenir was very poor. And so there's, again, a lot of things that are moving around and so once we get to next year, we'll clarify all of that.",Michael Ross,4393933
,,,,
12709,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. And maybe another tough one here. In terms of ? similar question on SG&A. Less packaway, less labor-related to transaction, some of these items appear to be perhaps a bit transient. Is there any way, any color you can give us help identify that kind of transient impact on estimating the benefit there?",Vishal Shreedhar,4393933
,,,,
12710,Question-and-Answer,"No. Well, again, we explained why we see some improvements in labor. Obviously the great sales one, but also ? and you mentioned that traffic, there's less traffic, so we need less hours to ? at store level slightly. And if in the future traffic comes back higher, which is a positive, well, we'll need to put more hours to address that. So there are communicating links here, but for the time being, we are where we are right now.",Michael Ross,4393933
,,,,
12711,Question-and-Answer,Thank you.,Vishal Shreedhar,4393933
,,,,
12712,Question-and-Answer,You're welcome.,Michael Ross,4393933
,,,,
12713,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. The next question is from Brian Morrison of TD Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.,Operator,4393933
,,,,
12714,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you. Good morning. Michael, I hear you with respect to the limited price markups that you say you're taking, but I just want to follow-up and ask, what are you seeing from your competitors? Are they taking price especially as we see increases with respect to a higher price of commodities and higher price of food? And is the potential for price inflation impact the timing or importance of bringing on a new price point?",Brian Morrison,4393933
,,,,
12715,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. So for the food part, we are not ? our mix of products is very low, so that's one part. But for the rest, like I say, if we see some lower markups following the market competitive environment, where we're a price follower, not a price setter. And so if we do see opportunities, if they do start passing on costs then we'll evaluate the opportunity to do the same. Again, nothing changed. It's always been like that. And for now the intention is to keep it that way.",Michael Ross,4393933
,,,,
12716,Question-and-Answer,,Michael Ross,4393933
,,,,
12717,Question-and-Answer,"I guess, to ask it another way. Are you seeing competition starting to take price at a more aggressive rate than you would have said three to six months ago?",Brian Morrison,4393933
,,,,
12718,Question-and-Answer,"No. I would say the answer is no. By the same token, I think that we are starting to see some price pressures on raw materials and certainly on freight and other things that will be coming into effect. And I believe that you will start seeing the market have cost pressures and therefore, markups. And to be clear, they're not markups for more margin, they're markups to keep margins. So it's a different philosophy when the cost of goods are going up. It's more about maintaining than it is about growing your margin.",Neil Rossy,4393933
,,,,
12719,Question-and-Answer,"But when I look at what's happening to raw materials around the world and to freight rates, particularly from Asia when it comes to freight rates, there's no question that there will be cost pressures going forward, and that as those cost pressures get addressed by the market, we will adjust accordingly.",Neil Rossy,4393933
,,,,
12720,Question-and-Answer,"I understand that doesn't necessarily impact your margin, but it does give you greater pricing flexibility on a going forward basis. You'd agree with that, correct?",Brian Morrison,4393933
,,,,
12721,Question-and-Answer,"If it was market wide and raw material wide, yes.",Neil Rossy,4393933
,,,,
12722,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. And then Michael, just to be clear, your NCIB, you plan on starting that actively next week. Is that the message?",Brian Morrison,4393933
,,,,
12723,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, we are.",Michael Ross,4393933
,,,,
12724,Question-and-Answer,All right. Thank you both very much.,Brian Morrison,4393933
,,,,
12725,Question-and-Answer,Yes. Okay. You're welcome.,Michael Ross,4393933
,,,,
12726,Question-and-Answer,Thank you.,Neil Rossy,4393933
,,,,
12727,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. The next question is from Karen Short of Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.,Operator,4393933
,,,,
12728,Question-and-Answer,"Hi. Thanks very much. Just a question for you with respect to the $4.50, $5 price points. Neil, you commented on the fact that new ideas being generated were much lower than normal. So I guess I'm wondering, one, does that make the $4.50 to $5 harder to introduce just given maybe a lack of newness? But two, from the timeline that you internally decide to go with the next level, what is the timeline typically from decision, yes, like a go decision to actually seeing it in the store, and would that get pushed out a little more in the current environment? And then I had one other question.",Karen Short,4393933
,,,,
12729,Question-and-Answer,"It wouldn't get pushed out. It would still be three to nine months post the decision to do it with regards to seeing the goods in the stores from an import perspective. If the goods were domestic, it could be a week to be honest. But the decision again is very much a consequence of both the cost of goods as well as the opportunities. And so if the cost of goods for everybody goes up dramatically, then that decision to add price points maybe one simply of being able to maintain our offering.",Neil Rossy,4393933
,,,,
12730,Question-and-Answer,"If the cost of goods don't go up and the world goes back to normal, let's say, then it'll be more on the side of possibly introducing new items. So it's very much dependent on the situation. And since we all live on the same planet, we all have that same challenge. And again, thankfully, we're in the business of relative value. And so whatever we do, we're playing the same game as everybody else.",Neil Rossy,4393933
,,,,
12731,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. And then just on that actual cost of goods or overall inflation, so what are you ? what did you see in the quarter from an inflation perspective and what do you ? how are you thinking about inflation for 4Q in 2021? And I guess maybe ? freight as well as actual product.",Karen Short,4393933
,,,,
12732,Question-and-Answer,"Right. So again, we ? going into the Q4 quarter, same momentum as you've seen in Q3. Okay. So we had margin improvement in Q3. So we're saying we're having some, and that includes, like I said earlier, a very little markup, so that talks to the rest of the factors. For next year, we don't know yet. Like Neil said, we ? and as I said earlier too, we expect cost pressures from our suppliers, we expect cost pressures from shipping, we expect a tailwind from the currency, and we've got our refresh that we do every year and markup opportunities. So all of that will allow us to continue doing what we've done well historically and to manage the margin. And in Q3 ? in Q4, Karen, we'll have a bit more information obviously closer to the year ? in the year, and hopefully give you more information.",Michael Ross,4393933
,,,,
12733,Question-and-Answer,,Michael Ross,4393933
,,,,
12734,Question-and-Answer,Thanks and congratulations on your retirement.,Karen Short,4393933
,,,,
12735,Question-and-Answer,Thank you.,Michael Ross,4393933
,,,,
12736,Question-and-Answer,People really seem to want to see you go Michael.,Neil Rossy,4393933
,,,,
12737,Question-and-Answer,I'm not going yet.,Michael Ross,4393933
,,,,
12738,Question-and-Answer,Okay.,Neil Rossy,4393933
,,,,
12739,Question-and-Answer,The next question is from Patricia Baker of Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.,Operator,4393933
,,,,
12740,Question-and-Answer,"Good morning, everyone. Michael, I want to follow-up with your discussion on the self-checkouts. You said that at the end of Q3, you?ll have them in 175 stores by year-end, you'll have them in 200 stores. And I'm just curious if you could provide us with some sort of indication with that group of 200 stores, what's the average revenue gap is between them and your average revenue of the fleet? Just some degree of magnitude.",Patricia Baker,4393933
,,,,
12741,Question-and-Answer,"And then secondly, with respect to the remaining stores in the network, I'm presuming that there are other stores that also are high traffic stores and do large revenue that will benefit maybe in the future from having self-checkouts and we'll be able to see operating efficiencies in those particular stores. And also look like they would provide a good payback. Is that fair?",Patricia Baker,4393933
,,,,
12742,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. Okay. So first question is ? so yes, we're expecting 200 this year. We will give you more information next year in Q4 as to what we propose for next year. But there are definitely more stores next year that we're going to be introducing self-checkouts. You are right, self-checkouts are a topline savings generator, it?s to reduce the queue line. That's the purpose of the self-checkout and we?ve seen that working very well during this COVID period.",Michael Ross,4393933
,,,,
12743,Question-and-Answer,"And so we do see efficiencies? We don't. So in other words, there are added efficiencies of having introduced a self-checkout and a good portion of that was topline generated and we will have more next year. We're not going to go into ? we're not disclosing the details, but I have to say that we're definitely going ahead and pushing more self-checkouts in stores next year.",Michael Ross,4393933
,,,,
12744,Question-and-Answer,Okay. Fair enough. And I'm just going to ask the first part in a slightly different way. And I am right in assuming that those 200 stores actually do higher revenues than the average revenue per store of the entire fleet.,Patricia Baker,4393933
,,,,
12745,Question-and-Answer,"They do all ? well, I'm not sure.",Michael Ross,4393933
,,,,
12746,Question-and-Answer,Okay.,Patricia Baker,4393933
,,,,
12747,Question-and-Answer,"You're right. That it's ? for those stores that higher traffic or the space, they show definitely a better trend after, but I wouldn't talk about?",Michael Ross,4393933
,,,,
12748,Question-and-Answer,I would tell you that it's not representative of our 200 strongest stores.,Neil Rossy,4393933
,,,,
12749,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. Excellent. Okay, perfect. Sorry, I could have asked it better. Thanks a lot, guys.",Patricia Baker,4393933
,,,,
12750,Question-and-Answer,"No. It's okay, Patricia. It's time that I leave now. I can't even understand the questions anymore.",Michael Ross,4393933
,,,,
12751,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. And the last question is from Edward Kelly of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.,Operator,4393933
,,,,
12752,Question-and-Answer,Yes. Hi guys. Good morning.,Edward Kelly,4393933
,,,,
12753,Question-and-Answer,Hi.,Michael Ross,4393933
,,,,
12754,Question-and-Answer,Good morning.,Neil Rossy,4393933
,,,,
12755,Question-and-Answer,"Just a couple of questions. First is sort of a follow-up on I think, where Karen was maybe going on $4.50, $5. As you think about moving up into a higher price point, does the merchandising opportunity change, meaning that, you'd have the ability to maybe sell new items that you haven't been able to in the past that may even be more incremental for the store offering and then what you've historically been able to do as you go up in price?",Edward Kelly,4393933
,,,,
12756,Question-and-Answer,"So to answer your question, conceptually yes. But again, it depends on whether when one goes to a higher price point, they're doing it as a result of global cost pressures in order to maintain the same assortment as we currently have or whether it's a matter of new available items purely and no cost pressures and that decision can be taken for an entirely different reasons. So far we haven't taken it for either of those reasons. And for the moment until further notice, we have no intention of taking that decision for the time being. But should it present itself and should we make the announcement that we're going to do it, it would be for one of those two reasons.",Neil Rossy,4393933
,,,,
12757,Question-and-Answer,,Neil Rossy,4393933
,,,,
12758,Question-and-Answer,"And maybe just to add to that and to corroborate what Neil is saying, August 2012, when we introduced $2.50, $3 was to bring in new items or the ? even in February 2009. In August 2016, we?d just gone through 30% inflation on the currency over 18 months. And that accelerated for us the introduction of the $3.50, $4 price points because our top price point at the time was pressured by a steep increase in the inflation. So those are your two examples right there.",Michael Ross,4393933
,,,,
12759,Question-and-Answer,"Understood. That's helpful. And just a follow-up for you. So as we think about digital, if you look at some of your peers in the U.S., they have started to move down the road of a broader digital offering, particularly around sort of like buy online, pick up in-store. Any changes is to how you're thinking about that, particularly given what?s sort of happened with the pandemic and an adoption around things like that?",Edward Kelly,4393933
,,,,
12760,Question-and-Answer,"Right. So in our case buy online, pick up in-store is very dependent on the situation, let's say the pandemic situation and how it's being handled store-by-store, province-by-province, region-by-region. We don't think for the moment that there's much upside to have people do the shop of dollar items piece-by-piece, and then have a store prepare that per customer ready to pickup. We don't believe that is an economically viable business plan.",Neil Rossy,4393933
,,,,
12761,Question-and-Answer,"So if it's a piece-by-piece business, we're going to keep the customers coming back to pickup the pieces themselves, so to speak. And if it's something that they need to access or want to access those goods by the case, then that's what our current platform is for. But in the $1 to $4 range, we don't believe that having people handle and shop so to speak for a single customer piece-by-piece at $1 to $4 will ever be an economically viable plan.",Neil Rossy,4393933
,,,,
12762,Question-and-Answer,Makes sense. Thank you.,Edward Kelly,4393933
,,,,
12763,Question-and-Answer,"For the time being, who knows what the future holds.",Neil Rossy,4393933

,,,,
12774,Presentation,"With that, I'll now turn the call over to Brett.",Ryan Coleman,4393928
,,,,
12775,Presentation,"Thank you, Ryan and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today to review Powell's fiscal 2020 fourth quarter and full year results. I will make a few comments and then turn the call over to Mike for more financial commentary before we take your questions.",Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12776,Presentation,"Since our last update, our enhanced safety measures have remained in place and we have continued to prioritize the health of our employees, customers, and suppliers above all else.",Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12777,Presentation,"As an essential business, we remain fully operational. We continue to follow all recommended safe work practices, such as ensuring that our team has access to the personal protective equipment they need on a daily basis, safe distancing at workstation, staggered work schedules, and where and when possible work-from-home options for roles that support manufacturing operation. I continue to be impressed by our team's response during this crisis and their commitment to Powell and our customers.",Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12778,Presentation,"Throughout the fourth quarter, industrial end markets remained clouded and under pressure as a result of the pandemic, which impacted our revenue and new orders for the quarter accordingly. However, across all of Powell, our operations executed well on current projects and we?re able to contain costs effectively.",Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12779,Presentation,"Fourth quarter revenues were $115 million, down 23% when compared to the prior year and lower by roughly 3% sequentially. The decline was driven by the lower revenue from both our oil and gas and petrochemical customers, which were down 50% and 35% respectively compared to fiscal 2019. Those declines were partially offset by sustained activity in our utility and traction market, which each grew over 30% compared to last year.",Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12780,Presentation,,Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12781,Presentation,"Fourth quarter gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 18.9%, which is a decline of just 30 basis points compared to one year ago and an increase of 80 basis points compared to last quarter. Sequential increase resulted from restructuring activities that we took in May as well as strong productivity in our domestic operation.",Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12782,Presentation,"We continue to restrict travel and other discretionary expenses in this environment, partially due to local, state, and federal stipulation. Going forward, we will continue to evaluate our cost structure to ensure we are aligned with the current environment, while ensuring we remain properly staffed for the eventual return on project -- customer project activity.",Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12783,Presentation,"We reported net income of $3 million in the quarter, down from $6.5 million in the prior year, primarily due to a decline in revenues and gross profit, resulting [ph] from a decrease in new orders and adverse market conditions.",Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12784,Presentation,"We continue to effectively manage our working capital position. Combined [ph] with our focus on our cost structure, we generated $18 million of free cash flow in the quarter.",Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12785,Presentation,New bookings on a gross basis for the fourth quarter were $75 million. Net orders for the fourth quarter were $57 million as the quarter was offset by $18 million of adjustments to previously booked orders.,Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12786,Presentation,"Within that $18 million, $13 million was related to a previously awarded project in our backlog that was re-scoped to an engineering-only project at the request of our customer and their engineering partner.",Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12787,Presentation,"We ended the quarter with backlog totaling $477 million, which includes the previously announced large industrial order that was booked in the second quarter to support the design, manufacture, integration, and testing of a Powell custom integrated electrical distribution solution. Powell designed, built, and delivered multiple power control rooms in support of the project. This contract will convert to revenue over a three-year period.",Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12788,Presentation,"During the quarter, we continued to experience lower bookings rate consistent with the third quarter as the impact of the pandemic hit our core market. However, we did experience improved quoting activity at the start of the fourth quarter across most of our operations.",Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12789,Presentation,"One of the key value differentiations of Powell's model is our extensive engineering capability. Consistent with prior economic cycles, we are starting to see an increase in engineering-only awards. These awards keep our engineering teams utilized in the near-term, while enabling our clients to continue to progress their projects till such time when full funding is approved.",Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12790,Presentation,"Visibility remains a challenge for many of our customers as they grapple with a significant deterioration in the near-term outlook relative to the beginning of 2020. As we've discussed, we have seen several mid to large projects shift their schedules into 2021 at the earliest while a handful of customers continue to evaluate their timetable.",Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12791,Presentation,"As I briefly mentioned, the bright spot in the quarter was the activity within our utility and traction market. Additionally, short cycle service, parts, and OEM work have continued to show steady improvement. These projects are typically smaller, but they are important work that utilize our assets and our cost structure.",Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12792,Presentation,"Powell has gone through numerous downturns in customer activity that we have successfully navigated in the past, most recently during our fiscal 2015 through 2017. Of course, the drivers this time are different; steps we are taking in response are similar.",Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12793,Presentation,"More than ever, it is critical during times like this that we continue to deliver the premier service our customers have come to expect from Powell during our 73 year history as a leader in electrical distribution solutions.",Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12794,Presentation,We are also taking the necessary steps to manage our cost structure and preserve the strength of our balance sheet. We ended the fiscal year with $179 million of cash and short-term investments and essentially zero debt. This offers us incredible optionality as we navigate this environment.,Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12795,Presentation,,Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12796,Presentation,"Looking forward, we believe the economics of low cost abundant natural gas will continue to provide favorable opportunities in the LNG, gas pipeline, and gas to chemical process industries.",Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12797,Presentation,"We also see opportunities in the renewable markets of hydrogen, biofuels, and biodiesel. Several projects are in the planning stages that would drive future demand for both the process plants and the supporting pipeline infrastructure. Additionally, we anticipate that oil to chemical projects will become more economically viable as oil prices support a return for these projects.",Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12798,Presentation,"Lastly, any future tightening of regulations that require a lower level of sulfur will drive higher demand for electrical distribution as refiners are required to upgrade facilities to meet improved emission standards.",Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12799,Presentation,"Like all cycles, our industrial market and customer activity will improve, and we are ensuring that we make progress against the initiatives that will drive Powell's future growth.",Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12800,Presentation,One of these initiatives is Powell's ongoing commitment to research and development and technological innovation. Our roots of innovating in the face of new market challenges date back to the company's founding. We have both the expertise to organically develop new solutions in house as well as the flexibility to evaluate and take advantage of inorganic opportunities. It has been a core component of Powell's past and will be a critical piece of Powell's future.,Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12801,Presentation,"Example of this encouraging progress and emerging opportunities within our growing electrical automation business. We've long been a provider of solutions to help safely manage to control the distribution of electrical energy. The adoption of event-based maintenance strategies for electrical distribution equipment, combined with the continuing cost challenges, but managing a growing fleet of electrical assets for our customers is driving increasing acceptance of digital technologies to solve tomorrow's challenges.",Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12802,Presentation,We are helping to reduce unplanned outages and maximize uptime for our customers' facility by combining the Powell's policy existing capabilities in the application of automation with our new and developing line of electrical assets sensors.,Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12803,Presentation,"Our suite of monitoring technology currently includes all the functions of the breaker, the heart of the electrical distribution system. We have recently developed additional sensors to monitor leading indicators of potential issues including heat or thermal effects, signals that indicate the breakdown of electrical insulation, and environmental conditions such as humidity and dust that could affect the safe operation of the electrical distribution system.",Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12804,Presentation,"These solutions will help our customers reduce their costs and help protect their capital investment. This is a new market opportunity that?s still in its development stage, but we are seeing promising traction in this higher margin business.",Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12805,Presentation,"Before I turn the call over to Mike, I'll outline our key focus areas as we move into fiscal 2021. First and foremost is the health and safety of our employees, customers, and suppliers. We are also focused on maintaining our solid execution performance to ensure that we continue to meet the high expectation customers have with Powell.",Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12806,Presentation,"Next is the continuous evaluation of our current cost structure, supply chain, and resource planning to optimize operations across geographies, markets, and customers. It is also critical that we continue to pursue future growth opportunities end markets for Powell. We certainly possess the human capital, balance sheet strength, technological expertise to remain proactive in the current environment.",Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12807,Presentation,"With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike to provide more detail around our financial results before we take your questions.",Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12808,Presentation,,Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12809,Presentation,"Thank you, Bret and good morning everyone. Revenues for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2020 decreased 23% to $115 million compared to last year's fourth quarter of $149 million and were down $3 million sequentially as we encountered continued softness across our core industrial and markets.",Michael Metcalf,4393928
,,,,
12810,Presentation,Net orders for the fourth fiscal quarter were $57 million with $75 million of new orders booked in the period offset by $18 million order cancellations and scope adjustments to the backlog.,Michael Metcalf,4393928
,,,,
12811,Presentation,The $18 million consisted of $13 million of a converted or re-scoped project and roughly $5 million of cancellation. These net reported results reflect a 65% decrease versus the prior year in resulted in a book-to-bill ratio of 0.5 times for the quarter.,Michael Metcalf,4393928
,,,,
12812,Presentation,"Reported backlog at the end of our fourth quarter was $477 million, $58 million higher versus the same period in the prior year. Compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, domestic revenues of $81 million decreased by $34 million or 29% versus the same period one year ago, while international revenues were flat versus the prior year.",Michael Metcalf,4393928
,,,,
12813,Presentation,"From an end market perspective versus the prior fiscal year, revenues from our industrial sector decreased by 45%, while the utility sector was higher by 31% and traction revenue increased by 32%.",Michael Metcalf,4393928
,,,,
12814,Presentation,"The year-over-year volume reduction across the industrial sector was led by a 50% decline in oil and gas volume, while petrochemical revenue was down 35% versus same period a year ago.",Michael Metcalf,4393928
,,,,
12815,Presentation,"We reported $22 million of gross profit in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2020, which was lower by $7 million or 24% versus the prior year at 23% less value.",Michael Metcalf,4393928
,,,,
12816,Presentation,Gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased by 30 basis points to 18.9% of revenues in the fourth fiscal quarter compared to one year ago. This was driven in large part by unfavorable year-over-year project mix in our international location partially offset by favorable productivity across most of our domestic locations.,Michael Metcalf,4393928
,,,,
12817,Presentation,"Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased by $3.4 million or 17% versus the prior year attributable to restructuring benefits and overall cost management. SG&A expenses were $16.3 million in the fiscal fourth quarter or 14.2% of revenue compared to 13.3% of revenues a year ago on the lower revenue comparison.",Michael Metcalf,4393928
,,,,
12818,Presentation,"On a net reported basis, fiscal fourth quarter net income was $3 million or $0.25 per diluted share. We generated $18 million of free cash flow in the fiscal fourth quarter. This was driven by our strong working capital performance in the period as we see the benefits of projects closeout as well as favorable milestone billings and collections.",Michael Metcalf,4393928
,,,,
12819,Presentation,"CapEx spending during the quarter was $852,000.",Michael Metcalf,4393928
,,,,
12820,Presentation,"Now, recapping our total year fiscal 2020. Revenues of $519 million increased $1 million compared to the prior year. Orders were $577 million, 15% lower versus fiscal 2019. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased by 140 basis points to 18.2% of revenue and favorable volume leverage and productivity across most of our North American operation.",Michael Metcalf,4393928
,,,,
12821,Presentation,"Selling, general, and administrative expenses were lower by $2.3 million versus the prior year. This was partially offset by $1.4 million of restructuring costs in fiscal 2020 in addition to a non-repeatable insurance settlement benefiting fiscal 2019 by $950,000. Overall, net SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenues were flat year-over-year at 13.4%.",Michael Metcalf,4393928
,,,,
12822,Presentation,We reported net income of $16.7 million or $1.42 per diluted share compared to $9.9 million or $0.85 per diluted share in fiscal 2019. Total fiscal year 2020 free cash flow totaled $67 million versus $65 million in the prior year.,Michael Metcalf,4393928
,,,,
12823,Presentation,"At the end of fiscal 2020, we had cash and short-term investment of $179 million, $54 million higher than our fiscal 2019 yearend position. Long-term debt including current maturities was $800,000.",Michael Metcalf,4393928
,,,,
12824,Presentation,,Michael Metcalf,4393928
,,,,
12825,Presentation,"Looking forward to fiscal 2021, we continue to be adversely affected by the uncertainty across our industrial end markets and anticipate that these cyclical conditions may persist throughout fiscal 2020.",Michael Metcalf,4393928
,,,,
12826,Presentation,"That said, as we navigate these near-term economic variables, we are well-positioned to manage through the industrial end market dynamics as we continue to focus on executing the backlog, while also maintaining our strong liquidity.",Michael Metcalf,4393928
,,,,
12827,Presentation,"We are also seeing stronger activity in our utility and traction markets, which were higher by 31% and 32%, respectively in the fourth quarter.",Michael Metcalf,4393928
,,,,
12828,Presentation,"While project orders in these markets are smaller in scope, they're important projects that helped to keep our asset base utilized and leveraged until our industrial end markets recover.",Michael Metcalf,4393928
,,,,
12829,Presentation,"As we've demonstrated in the past, we're committed to maximizing margins across the portfolio and we'll continue these efforts into fiscal 2021 and beyond. Additionally, our balance sheet is strong, which provides the business with the element of optionality as we assess opportunities to diversify and grow into the future.",Michael Metcalf,4393928
,,,,
12830,Presentation,"As a reminder, we typically encounter a seasonality impact at the start of our fiscal year and as such, we do anticipate that the first quarter will be softer sequentially from an earnings perspective, due to fewer days worked resulting from holidays and paid time off compared to the prior quarter.",Michael Metcalf,4393928
,,,,
12831,Presentation,"At this point, we'll be happy to answer your questions.",Michael Metcalf,4393928
,,,,
12832,Question-and-Answer,We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions],Operator,4393928
,,,,
12833,Question-and-Answer,Our first question today comes from John Franzreb with Sidoti & Co. Please go ahead.,Operator,4393928
,,,,
12834,Question-and-Answer,Good morning Brett and Mike. How you doing?,John Franzreb,4393928
,,,,
12835,Question-and-Answer,Good morning John.,Michael Metcalf,4393928
,,,,
12836,Question-and-Answer,Hey John. Good. Thanks.,Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12837,Question-and-Answer,"I actually want to start with the ? consider at least the rare occurrence of cancelled orders, could you give us a little bit of background on why that happened and what marketplace it was in?",John Franzreb,4393928
,,,,
12838,Question-and-Answer,"The market John on that one is a gas to chemical project, and it's a repeat customer, longtime customer of Powell. It is a little unique in the re-scoping of it. Of the $13 [ph] million, I assume that?s the core question because there were just some straight our cancellations on that Mike mentioned in the detail. But yes, gas to chemical and from what I can see balance sheet, it is called a charter [ph] balance sheet and deferred spending to a later time, so they called us up and we converted to the engineering-only. We anticipate at some point, though, that will come back, they just wanted to pull back on the committed cash.",Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12839,Question-and-Answer,"Okay, obviously, I was more -- I was actually more interested in the cancelled projects rather than the re-scope, Brett, because that's what I consider relatively rare. Is there any commonality in them?",John Franzreb,4393928
,,,,
12840,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. $5 million or so balance on the cancels were more in the oil space, straight refining, brick-and-mortar type jobs.",Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12841,Question-and-Answer,Okay. Any sense that that business has bottomed or are you still concerned about the trajectory of that market?,John Franzreb,4393928
,,,,
12842,Question-and-Answer,"If you look at the Q3, Q4, it was kind of the same run rate. I think we might see one or two more is bottoming, but I don't know if we've seen the end of that yet.",Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12843,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. Recently, a comparable company, a competitor company put some assets up for sale. I wonder if you've looked at those assets. Do you think they're attractive? It's not something you're interested in because you did mention, which is something kind of rare, I think you also -- is that you are looking at inorganic growth opportunities. So can you just kind of expand upon that?",John Franzreb,4393928
,,,,
12844,Question-and-Answer,"So, I know the question has been asked in previous calls, and what we're doing with cash. And I share very openly that with the Board and the management team, our conversations have been very focused on this subject and how we're going to direct the company and work the strategies right [ph] for the future, but working on that now for the better part of the year.",Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12845,Question-and-Answer,,Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12846,Question-and-Answer,"Those conversations continue, as I mentioned before, to become more focused around a couple of key strategies. We are watching the marketplace with our competitors in many senses, and so we're aware of that and evaluating how that might be best for Powell's shareholders in the future.",Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12847,Question-and-Answer,So that means you're considering inorganic growth opportunities or not?,John Franzreb,4393928
,,,,
12848,Question-and-Answer,We are. We are starting to try to build the framework and guidelines by which we're going to stay disciplined to add to our strategy here to push the company forward into where we see the market heading for what we're -- for Powell.,Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12849,Question-and-Answer,"Got it. One last question and I'll get back into queue. We?re nearly done with the first quarter besides the seasonality, which you are reminding us all about, how is it kind of shaping up relative to the fourth quarter on any kind of comparable basis that you can help us with?",John Franzreb,4393928
,,,,
12850,Question-and-Answer,"Coming off of Q4, we certainly -- in my prepared remarks, I mentioned the upturn in quoting activity, right. That was a big difference when everybody was trying to figure out what was going on in Q3 as everything was kind of scattered all over the place.",Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12851,Question-and-Answer,"We're still seeing some effect of people just not in their offices, the remote workplace continues to have sort of a slowdown effect, whether it's utility traction or core oil and gas petrochem.",Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12852,Question-and-Answer,"The activity definitely picked up. The run rate is still sort of running, but from a mix standpoint, the engineering-only awards picked up, and while those aren't large dollars, those are sort of the reservation, so to speak of the future. So, my sense of optimism for if and when those get funded, which of course there's no guarantee they will, we're making some good progress at future business, but from an actual run rate, no rate change heading into the first couple of months of the quarter.",Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12853,Question-and-Answer,"Other than the mix is looking, it's more positive sense of just looking forward from a want to fund things; and when it does, I feel good we will be in the right position to put those in the backlog.",Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12854,Question-and-Answer,Great. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I'll hop back in the queue.,John Franzreb,4393928
,,,,
12855,Question-and-Answer,Our next question will come from Jon Braatz with Kansas City Capital. Please go ahead.,Operator,4393928
,,,,
12856,Question-and-Answer,Good morning guys,Jon Braatz,4393928
,,,,
12857,Question-and-Answer,Good morning Jon.,Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12858,Question-and-Answer,"Mike a question on the working capital needs maybe as we head into this -- in 2021. Obviously, business is going to be soft, but do you see any need to build working capital?",Jon Braatz,4393928
,,,,
12859,Question-and-Answer,"And the second question would be, were your cash balances boosted at all by tax deferrals -- payroll tax deferrals related to the COVID legislation?",Jon Braatz,4393928
,,,,
12860,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, so I'll take the second one first, the answer to that is no, we didn't have any impacts due to the COVID legislation that went through. From a working capital impact looking forward into fiscal 2021 and first I digress to 2020, great year for working capital cash overall for the company, really driven by a couple things. The working capital was benefited by the unwinding of a lot of these projects that had finished up in the second half of 2020 as well as some of the milestone billings for that large project.",Michael Metcalf,4393928
,,,,
12861,Question-and-Answer,"Looking forward into 2021, we will use some of that cash for working capital for this sizable project that we're executing in 2021 and 2022. So, I would expect cash to come down a little bit as we work our way through mid-2021.",Michael Metcalf,4393928
,,,,
12862,Question-and-Answer,Okay. Okay. And looking at the new business opportunity -- new business that you're seeing coming in the door. How does that look on the margin front? Are you seeing any -- in this week environment any renewed -- any margin pressure?,Jon Braatz,4393928
,,,,
12863,Question-and-Answer,"Coming in -- Jon coming into Q1, we are. We didn't see it so much in Q4, I think we were asked a question, but if not, in Q1; we're starting to see some price pressure. And again, it's in those traditional markets where we typically see pressure, which is more utility on the generation side and some of these markets that this distribution isn't as difficult, they're a little bit more open to competition that you will start to see some there.",Michael Metcalf,4393928
,,,,
12864,Question-and-Answer,,Michael Metcalf,4393928
,,,,
12865,Question-and-Answer,"Okay, one last question. And this is probably a long shot, but I was reading the other day about offshore drilling activity and offshore oil production. And there was some comments in there about how maybe with these higher oil prices and new technology, that offshore oil and gas production may begin a little bit more in earnest than we've seen recently.",Jon Braatz,4393928
,,,,
12866,Question-and-Answer,"And talking about maybe Gulf of Mexico and Brazil and so on, Brett are you seeing any activity in sort of your legacy business, the oil and gas platform business or production business?",Jon Braatz,4393928
,,,,
12867,Question-and-Answer,"We do have one job that we took last year, where the offshore market traditional for Powell really changed several years ago. We did see a little bit from a legacy job, legacy customer last year do one of these smaller CapEx expansions and sort of field extensions.",Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12868,Question-and-Answer,"I do you watch the FPSO market, Jon, it's not a market we have competed in it, we struggle a little bit to really effectively compete. Well, that market is actually doing a little better for the offshore side right now in those markets you mentioned. So, yes, we're watching it. We are watching even those legacy customers or what how they're thinking about these extensions.",Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12869,Question-and-Answer,"And what would they do either top sides or new technologies to extend these fields or take an existing platform rework it? And even though power structure, the new strategy, a lot of new thought and power from short type applications won't work for that due to on-deck distribution design. So, definitely, sticking [ph] our brush with that.",Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12870,Question-and-Answer,Okay. All right. Thank you very much.,Jon Braatz,4393928
,,,,
12871,Question-and-Answer,Our next question will come from John Deysher with Pinnacle. Please go ahead.,Operator,4393928
,,,,
12872,Question-and-Answer,"Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question.",John Deysher,4393928
,,,,
12873,Question-and-Answer,Hey John.,Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12874,Question-and-Answer,I was just curious you mentioned margin pressure going into the current quarter. Are you walking away from any business because of price?,John Deysher,4393928
,,,,
12875,Question-and-Answer,"No, not yet. I go back to -- in my prepared comments, John, I talked about the 15/17 parallel. There was a point and that cycle driven by again, as you recall that the drop in the oil price, everything that happened that led to that down cycle where we did reach a limit.",Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12876,Question-and-Answer,"We're not there yet. Didn't see really much price pressure in Q4, we just started seeing it kind of at the tail end. Well, beginning of Q1, we started to see a little bit and again in some select markets, not across the board.",Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12877,Question-and-Answer,"Okay, because I would guess some of your competitors don't have the rock solid balance sheet that you do. And I'm just a little concerned that those guys gain market share when you reach the price at which you won't compete.",John Deysher,4393928
,,,,
12878,Question-and-Answer,"No, we're not there yet and we have a lot of checks about the risk profile of the project in terms and the whole scope of the job, what we're building, how we're getting at the site, what are the onsite services, which is an area we're looking to expand upon? And how can we manage the risk with the engineering partner or the end customer to have a more open discussion before the jobs are worried about where Powell can help meet their needs on the job, which we know there's price pressure on first purchase price, but how can we mix around the scope to put Powell in the best light to do what we do best.",Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12879,Question-and-Answer,"So, those conversations are substantive and are happening now and we're cognizant of the risk profile by engaging the customer on that conversation. So, we can help them meet their need on the budget side, but yet, do what's best for Powell and not lose the job, while lower margin make sure the risk is managed as well.",Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12880,Question-and-Answer,"All right, okay. Good. That's good to hear. And on the strategic plan that you indicated, you've been working on for the better part of a year, is there a timeline there in terms of wrapping that up and figuring out exactly which direction you want to move?",John Deysher,4393928
,,,,
12881,Question-and-Answer,,John Deysher,4393928
,,,,
12882,Question-and-Answer,"Not yet. We're working on with the Board and the management team and we will get to the point of updating our Investor Relations deck, can't quite yet today give a timeframe when that will be published and to give the direction where we aspire to go, but I think we're coalescing around a couple of strategic options and so we're near there and hopefully very soon we'll be able to sort of lay that out in the share with all the shareholders where we see the best future for Powell, we're putting the money to work",Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12883,Question-and-Answer,"Okay, good. And finally from me, has the mix of the backlog shifted at all over the last year or so? I mean is it more non-petrochemical, non-oil and gas as a percentage or is it the same or how has the mix of the backlog shifted?",John Deysher,4393928
,,,,
12884,Question-and-Answer,"Yes John, this is Mike. The way I kind of look at the mix over the last year and as we go forward, what we are seeing is lower, clearly lower industrial backlog as we believe the oil and gas petrochem backlog, we are seeing more traction in utility work, however, as we mentioned in the prepared comments.",Michael Metcalf,4393928
,,,,
12885,Question-and-Answer,"So, we are seeing a little mix shift, both from a product standpoint -- product application standpoint as well as geographically we've got a very strong backlog in our Canadian facility as well as our U.K. facility, but they carry different margins as well. So, it does have a little bit of a mix impact.",Michael Metcalf,4393928
,,,,
12886,Question-and-Answer,"And industrial oil and gas, that's still the lion's share of the backlog at this point?",John Deysher,4393928
,,,,
12887,Question-and-Answer,"At this point, yes, correct",Michael Metcalf,4393928
,,,,
12888,Question-and-Answer,"Okay, good. And you mentioned traction. I'm not familiar with that, what is traction?",John Deysher,4393928
,,,,
12889,Question-and-Answer,"John -- that's so mostly in North America light rail and markets you think about Washington Metro, Bay Area Rapid Transit, Chicago Transit, Toronto Transit. So, we think the published that we do the rectifiers and the DC switchgear or powering a rail.",Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12890,Question-and-Answer,"Okay, great. Thanks and good luck.",John Deysher,4393928
,,,,
12891,Question-and-Answer,Thanks.,Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12892,Question-and-Answer,The next question will come from John Franzreb with Sidoti & Co. Please go ahead.,Operator,4393928
,,,,
12893,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, just a little bit on the cost structure. Have you brought back anybody that's been -- everybody that's been furloughed? Are you at the -- do you anticipate the go forward workforce load? And also I guess all the restructuring actions that you announced over the summer, are they completed and are there any more contemplated or are you satisfied with the current configuration of the firm?",John Franzreb,4393928
,,,,
12894,Question-and-Answer,"John, its Brett. I'll start and Mike can add some color here. So, nothing more since the May adjustment, nothing significant. Do we bring people back? Some of this engineering-only work, yeah we're going out to it is challenging us a little bit.",Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12895,Question-and-Answer,"So, it is sort of a little bit of a turn there in Q1, we're looking at those resources and trying to decide can we get some people back to handle this load, how long does it go. So, we are in that thought process right now. That's really the only function; the rest of the sort is status quo.",Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12896,Question-and-Answer,"Looking forward, it's quarter-by-quarter right now until we get better clarity. You sense in the market, there is this one desire with these engineering-only awards for instance that they get funded, it could be very interesting, if they don't, there is this -- when do you -- do you need to do something else, it drags on a different way.",Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12897,Question-and-Answer,"So, it is a little quarter to quarter until we get clarity and we're trying to be very thoughtful about the cost structure to not handicap us long-term because as you know the model takes a long time to split up knowledge if we let it out the door. So, we really want to keep our people.",Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12898,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. Mike, anything to add?",John Franzreb,4393928
,,,,
12899,Question-and-Answer,"I mean I think what we did in May and June, really benefited the second half of the year and to Brett's point, it's quarter-to-quarter, causing the worst cadence, the commercial activity out there, understanding just looking around the corner and we're doing that every three week. So, staying very close to it.",Michael Metcalf,4393928
,,,,
12900,Question-and-Answer,,Michael Metcalf,4393928
,,,,
12901,Question-and-Answer,"Okay and Brett the incoming order book, it may be the lowest I've seen in decades. How does that bounce around in the next coming quarters? Should we expect maybe a sharp recovery or is it just or is this down to visibility for you to tell?",John Franzreb,4393928
,,,,
12902,Question-and-Answer,"The visibility is very clouded. As I mentioned earlier John in your question, the pace in Q1 as we started isn't significantly different. The mix is a little different in that we're seeing some awards that aren't the whole job, it's the -- Powell helps get through these early phases and see what's going on in the market, what's going on in the pandemic and the effect on economy, the macro certainly has played here across the world.",Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12903,Question-and-Answer,"So, it's a little bit more positive in the sense of, let's get some work going because we think we want to get this job and so they get the full funding on the return through the end user. So, -- but the absolute number isn't significantly different.",Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12904,Question-and-Answer,"So, I don't John, I don't know, but if I look forward, there is potential to certainly have a couple of quarters that start to jump up nicely, but right now, quarter-over-quarter, the run rate is still very, very carefully use the word cautious coming in and I don't think there'll be any big change in that in the near term aka next quarter or two, but the potential is there that we could pop up quarter.",Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12905,Question-and-Answer,Okay. Thanks for taking my follow ups Brett.,John Franzreb,4393928
,,,,
12906,Question-and-Answer,"There being no further questions, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Brett Cope, CEO for any closing remarks.",Operator,4393928
,,,,
12907,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you, Grant. The pandemic is certainly challenging our customers and how we operate each day. However, Powell is uniquely positioned to weather the storm. We have an incredibly talented team, a healthy backlog, a strong balance sheet, and great relationships with our customers and suppliers.",Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12908,Question-and-Answer,We are firing on all cylinders across our operation and we are not standing at length's by while we wait for our industrial markets to recover. We are focused on advancing our efforts in new and encouraging growth avenues that will better diversify our backlog and project mix going forward.,Brett Cope,4393928
,,,,
12909,Question-and-Answer,"With that, thank you for your participation on today's call. We appreciate your continued interest in Powell and look forward to speaking with you all next quarter.",Brett Cope,4393928

12916,Presentation,"Now, I would like to turn the call over to the Company?s Chief Executive Officer, George Sherman.",Eric Cerny,4393729
,,,,
12917,Presentation,"Thanks, Eric. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today on our third quarter earnings call. I hope you all safe and well. The third fiscal quarter represents a key pivot point in our trajectory to stabilize, optimize and transform GameStop. We have made significant strides in stabilizing and optimizing our core operations and are excited about the transformational plan we are executing that will enable us to create long-term value as our industry continues its rapid growth.",George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
12918,Presentation,"Our third quarter results were largely as we had anticipated, marking the end of a challenging sales performance period as the industry transitions from Generation 8 to Generation 9 console video gaming products. The transition coupled with the impact of the global pandemic on consumer retail mobility and also to some extent supply chain disruptions is now segueing into what we see as a period of sustained growth, the beginnings of which I'll highlight in a moment.",George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
12919,Presentation,"First, to summarize the third quarter, as we anticipated sales and profitability were down, the profitable store sales declining 24.6% in an adjusted loss of $0.53 per share. But that notwithstanding, we saw 257% growth in our ecommerce sales versus the prior year, reflecting investments during the year that enhance our omni-channel capabilities.",George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
12920,Presentation,"We continued to reduce expenses delivering over $315 million in SG&A expenses expense reductions so far this year. And we're pleased and the quarter with almost 300 million more in cash the restricted cash compared to the end of the prior year third quarter. And as I mentioned, we made significant strides in stabilizing and optimizing our core operations over the last 15 months and we're excited about the plan we are executing for the rapid evolution of GameStop.",George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
12921,Presentation,,George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
12922,Presentation,"Despite the unprecedented environment during the global pandemic, our strong performance in November shows not only where we are, but the rapid pace of our transformation, beginning with the cost reductions can significantly improved balance sheet delivered by our ongoing work, followed by the console launch in early November and now our focus on key transformational strategies that will power future growth.",George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
12923,Presentation,"Our goal is simple. We are positioning GameStop to be the leading global omni-channel retailer for all things gaming and entertainment. We are encouraged by our successful efforts in 2020 to begin category and product extensions that increase our addressable market as well as by our customer's early response to an expanded products and services offering. At the forefront of this strategy is a digital first approach focused on delivering a best-in-class ecommerce experience, along with an optimized retail footprint.",George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
12924,Presentation,"Together with enhanced fulfillment options, they provide our customers with the most comprehensive set of games and entertainment products and events, wherever, however and whenever they want them. The current console based video games products are an important element of our strategy over the next few years, and we realized the very successful launch of the next generation products in November, driving 16.5% growth in comparable store sales.",George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
12925,Presentation,"This was the first positive comparable store sales month in nearly two years, despite being closed on Thanksgiving Day in North America, and the ongoing negative impact of COVID-19, which saw the closure of the vast majority of our European storefronts for the entire month. In addition to the appeal of next generation of consoles, these results also reflect the significant improvements we have already made to the performance of our omni-channel platform, as global online sales in the month of November grew 352%.",George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
12926,Presentation,"In line with these early results, we expect to generate strong sales growth and profitability in the final quarter of the year. Let's review some of the additional highlights for the third quarter. Jim will share some of the specific details of the quarter, but broadly speaking, our global store fleet saw on and off periods of store closure or restricted access to customers, particularly as COVID-19 cases accelerated around the world in October and then through November.",George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
12927,Presentation,"We believe the pandemic and importantly, the depression of retail customer mobility, lowered our comparable sales in the third quarter by 3 to 5 percentage points. Pivoting to our strategic accomplishments in the quarter, we continue to optimize our core business by improving efficiency and effectiveness across the organization, leading to a reduction in SG&A expenses of nearly $115 million for the quarter, bringing our total for the year to over $315 million versus 2019 roughly two-thirds of which we view as permanent.",George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
12928,Presentation,"We continue to work quickly to optimize our omni-channel capabilities through the transformation of our physical store presence. Through the third quarter, we have closed almost 800 stores worldwide since the beginning of 2019, representing both underperforming locations and de-densification in certain trade areas. We expect these closures to create a more profitable footprint.",George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
12929,Presentation,"In the U.S., we continue to see strong sales and profit transferred to neighboring locations and e-commerce, an important point in supporting the continued optimization of our store fleet. Consumer affinity for our continually improving e-commerce experience in the ease of shopping and same-day delivery of our omni-channel fulfillment is increasing efficiency across our store footprint. By the end of the fiscal year, we will close over 1,000 stores since we began this optimization journey in the middle of 2019, all with little to no capital outlay.",George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
12930,Presentation,,George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
12931,Presentation,"Given the strength of our e-commerce sales and omni-channel capabilities, which I'll comment on momentarily, we now see the opportunity to close additional stores going forward in 2021 and 2022 as we optimize the profitability of omni-channel architecture. Overall, our goal is to serve our customers wherever, whenever and however they choose to shop.",George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
12932,Presentation,"We continue to improve our balance sheet. We again improve working capital management with a 33% reduction in inventory and a 38% decline in accounts payable, ending the period was $603 million of cash and restricted cash about $300 million more than the prior year third quarter.",George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
12933,Presentation,"Finally, as a result of the continued strength of our balance sheet, we further enhance our capital structure with the announcement for the voluntary early redemption of $125 million for approximately 63% of our outstanding notes due in 2021. As you know, we remain very committed to our efforts to build a frictionless digital first omni-channel ecosystem in our customers are responding, significantly changing the way they shop with us.",George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
12934,Presentation,"Our focus on customer centricity and the best end to end customer experience has led to recent material gains in our e-commerce business, and we expect to build on this success reinforcing the core focus of our go for strategy. In the third quarter, we delivered a 257% increase in e-commerce sales versus the prior year, fueled by our elevated omni-channel capabilities. E-commerce penetration continues to grow and represents nearly 25% of total sales this year, up from a low single digit percentage historically.",George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
12935,Presentation,"We are also leveraging our expanded fulfillment capabilities such as curbside pickup, buy online pick up in store, ship and store. And in the third quarter, we rolled out same-day delivery for online transactions to 2000 locations, and now have that option available in all of our U.S. stores. Given a relatively high average transaction size, we can profitably partner with last mile delivery services to provide customers with same-day delivery.",George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
12936,Presentation,"Our new mobile app, which launched fully in October is much more engaging with the previous version and provides newly available functionality and dramatically improved customer experience. The app is customizable enables customers to personalize features, select same-day delivery options and browse a curated deal hub. With more people downloading and using the app on a weekly basis and engaging with it for longer periods of time, we've seen a significant increase in engagement within the transactions, a 30% increase in conversion.",George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
12937,Presentation,"With the increased usage, e-commerce sales originating from the app have now doubled. We are very pleased with the initial performance and look forward to rolling out additional features such as the gamer news feed and a comprehensive, easy to use digital wallet in early 2021.Going forward, you will see us leverage our GameStop ecosystem of stores, e-commerce and our app to deliver and enhanced 360 degree experience for consumers with products and services that are more relevant to how they connect and play in devices today and in the future, all with a focus on driving customer lifetime value.",George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
12938,Presentation,"These efforts have already resulted in and we believe will continue to lead to higher conversion, basket size, frequency of purchase, as well as a new customer acquisition for our power up loyalty program. As you appreciate these are very encouraging metrics. The progress we made during the quarter on our strategic initiatives, despite the COVID-19 backdrop, largely completes our optimization and stabilization phases of our strategy, which we've been working on for over the last 15 months and positions us for the next phase transformation.",George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
12939,Presentation,"Before discussing our future plans and opportunities, I'd like to quickly review the material accomplishments that we set out to achieve the launch of GameStop Reboot just 15 months ago. In that time, we optimized for physical store presence through the ongoing de-densification and we'll have close over 1,000 stores by the end of 2020.We exited unprofitable businesses in the four Nordic countries and divested of the Simply Mac business unit. We continue to take costs out of the business significantly reducing SG&A by $316 billion year-to-date in over $440 million from our starting point in the middle of 2019.",George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
12940,Presentation,,George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
12941,Presentation,"We increased productivity with an improved store labor strategy, investing in our e-commerce platform driving for 433% growth in the channel to nearly 25% of sales year-to-date. We improved inventory management with faster turns, delivering well over $300 million in working capital benefits, key to our ability to definitely navigate this pandemic. We monetized several assets including sale-leaseback transactions for five office buildings and the sale of our corporate jet, adding over $95 million in liquidity.",George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
12942,Presentation,"We enhanced our financial flexibility with the completion of an exchange offer and consensual citation for 216.4 million of our unsecured notes. Reducing the amount due to mature at March, 2021 to approximately 198 million of which we have already announced the voluntary early redemption of 125 million. By March, we?ve reduced the overall debt on our balance sheet by almost $600 million since early 2019. We repurchased 38.1 million shares since the spring of 2019, approximately 37% of shares outstanding at the time at a weighted average price of $5.21.",George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
12943,Presentation,"And we significantly expanded our customer payment options, including elevated focused on our private label credit card, adding several new -- several buy now pay later options and launch rent to own options to complete the payment stack. As we enter the fourth quarter, we have several tailwinds that set us up to win during this holiday season, starting with a new console cycle and including our digital omni-channel acceleration. But to be clear, we're not just focused on the console video game market, and we're expand the spectrum of products and services we sell to position GameStop to be a worldwide leader of games and entertainment for our customers.",George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
12944,Presentation,"As many of you have seen, we have begun to expand our skews to include PC gaming, computers, monitors, game tables, and gaming TVs to name only a few categories. Many of these skews will continue to be online exclusives. PC hardware and accessories represent a major market opportunity in industry research by NPD shows that the large majority of console gamers also play PC games.",George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
12945,Presentation,"Our overarching goal is to leverage the power and competitive advantages of our brand significant loyalty base, dedicated and experienced sales associates and expensive omni-channel capabilities to drive lifetime value across all things, games and entertainment.

,,,,
12947,Presentation,"We have made advancements that have begun to return our business to sales, growth and profitability, all enabling us to undertake the significant transformational work we now have underway.

12953,Presentation,"As the gaming consumer and industry evolve, we see an opportunity to expand our addressable market, the honor historical predominant focus on the console video game market, with a comprehensive suite of product offerings and new services across all categories for games and entertainment.",Jim Bell,4393729
,,,,
12954,Presentation,"And simply put, we're making it easier for consumers to find what they need at GameStop in an intuitive, relevant and frictionless shopping experience, all will taking a leadership role across the gaming entertainment categories. Economically, this means adding incremental purchase occasions with higher margin lines of business and therefore capturing greater share of wallet.",Jim Bell,4393729
,,,,
12955,Presentation,"Let me turn the review of the third fiscal quarter. As George mentioned, our third quarter sales performance was as expected as we transition through the final quarter of the Generation 8 console video game cycle, which included the shift of many software titles into the fourth quarter of this year and even in 2021. Further, we realized some top line softness in October as COVID-19 case spike drove retail consumer mobility down.",Jim Bell,4393729
,,,,
12956,Presentation,"Our consolidated global sale for the third quarter was $1 billion were 30.2% below the third quarter of 2019. The decline was a combination of the negative 24.6% comparable store sales, the impact of both foreclosures and lower retail customer mobility through most of our operating countries, and the impact of operating 607 fewer stores as part of our strategy to exit unprofitable businesses and optimize our store fleet through de-densification.",Jim Bell,4393729
,,,,
12957,Presentation,"We continue to see strong sales and profit transfer rates from that de-densification strategy. Geographically, our Australia and New Zealand business unit continue to perform very well relative to other regions, delivering a slight increase in sales for the quarter. It is important note that performance in this region is driven by very little reduction in store operating days as the COVID related retail operating mandates have generally not required full closure or limited access, except for short periods of time.",Jim Bell,4393729
,,,,
12958,Presentation,"In terms of category performance, hardware and accessories declined 24% for the quarter, and expected slight deceleration from the second quarter, largely reflected of a lack of hardware product in the marketplace, ahead of the launch of the new console, much of which was pulled forward into the second quarter. Despite this Nintendo Switch continued to perform extremely well, increasing significantly compared to last year. And we continue to leverage our pre-owned inventory to drive sales.",Jim Bell,4393729
,,,,
12959,Presentation,"Software was down 39% for the quarter versus 2019. A deceleration from the second quarter was driven by the lack of title launches, most of which shifted later into the fourth quarter and into 2021. Notably, Call of Duty launched in the third quarter of last year compared to the fourth quarter of this year.",Jim Bell,4393729
,,,,
12960,Presentation,"Our collectibles business was down 9% for the quarter, which represents a significant improvement sequentially from the second quarter performance as we realize the benefit of store traffic as stores begin reopening during the quarter after being closed during the second quarter.",Jim Bell,4393729
,,,,
12961,Presentation,"From product margin standpoint, overall gross margins declined as the increase in the mix of higher margin collectible sales was more than offset by the mix of lower margin hardware sales and an increase in industry-wide freight costs and credit card processing fees driven by our higher penetration of e-commerce sales. Our overall global gross margins were 27.5%, down 320 basis points from our more software led 30.7 in the fiscal third quarter last year.",Jim Bell,4393729
,,,,
12962,Presentation,,Jim Bell,4393729
,,,,
12963,Presentation,"Now turning to our expenses and expense management objectives, our reported SG&A expenses were 360 million reflecting a decline of approximately 115 million or 24% versus reported SG&A in the third quarter last year. The total year-to-date SG&A cost reductions reached over 315 million at the end of the third quarter ahead of our expectations. Importantly, we continue to expect about two-thirds of these reductions to be permanent, reflecting our ongoing efforts to aggressively rationalize the overall cost structure of our business.",Jim Bell,4393729
,,,,
12964,Presentation,"While we expect some of these variable costs come back in future quarters, as we return to more normalized operations of our stores and distribution centers. We are also steadfastly focused on further operational efficiencies to create additional permanent expense reductions in the future. To this end, we have more than doubled the original annual cost reductions we expect it as a result of these actions, we took as part of the Reboot initiative, which began in 2019.",Jim Bell,4393729
,,,,
12965,Presentation,"We reported an operating loss of $63 million, compared to an operating loss of $45.6 million in the prior year third quarter. Income tax in the third quarter was a benefit of 53.9 million driven by a change in the tax status of certain foreign entities that we've elected and the impact of the CARES Act, which a lot for a five year carry back period for certain current year tax losses. This tax benefit compares to an income tax expense of 31.6 million in the prior year third quarter. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 74.1%.",Jim Bell,4393729
,,,,
12966,Presentation,"On a reported basis, our net loss was $18.8 million, or a loss of $0.29 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of 83.4 million for loss per diluted share $1.02 in the prior year third quarter. Adjusted net loss, excluding the gain on sale of assets related to the sale leaseback transactions with 34.4 million or a loss of $0.53 per diluted share, compared to adjusted net loss of $40.2 million, or $0.49 per diluted share in the fiscal 2019 third quarter.",Jim Bell,4393729
,,,,
12967,Presentation,"During the third quarter, we continue to focus on optimizing our global store fleet and strategically identifying certain markets. For the quarter, we closed a net total of 74 stores bringing our total to 461 closures year-to-date. At the end of the quarter we operated with 5,048 stores or 607 fewer compared to the end of the third quarter last year.",Jim Bell,4393729
,,,,
12968,Presentation,"Given the strong sales and profit transfer rates we continue to experience, we are on track to close nearly 700 stores in total this fiscal year and over 1,000 stores worldwide since we began this part of our strategy in 2019. Importantly, we're completing these closures generally with little to no capital outlay to do so.",Jim Bell,4393729
,,,,
12969,Presentation,"Now turning to our balance sheet, which continues to be an area of focus for the team, at the end of the fiscal third quarter, we had total cash and restricted cash of 602.6 million almost 300 million higher than the end of the third quarter last year, reflecting our continued efforts to optimize working capital. Additionally, during the quarter we completed the sale leaseback transactions to the remaining two office buildings being offered, contributing $43.7 million towards total liquidity.",Jim Bell,4393729
,,,,
12970,Presentation,"Accounts payable at the quarter end were $44.2 million down from $709.9 million at the end of the third quarter last year, reflecting 38% reduction, which is directly related to our ability to leverage a flexible supply chain and improve our inventory management. We ended the third quarter with total inventory of $861 million compared to 1,286.7 million in the prior year period, a reduction of 33%. Inventory efficiency in the third quarter continue to improve, as we realized the trailing 12 months inventory turn of 4.7 times from 4.1 times this time last year.",Jim Bell,4393729
,,,,
12971,Presentation,"During the third quarter, we've reduced outstanding borrowings under the asset based revolving credit facility by about $10 million, down to $25 million outstanding. At the end of the third quarter, we had $269.5 million of short term debt and $216 million of long term debt on the balance sheet. Subsequent to the quarter end, we announced the voluntary early redemption of $125 million in principal amount of our 6.75% senior notes due 2021.",Jim Bell,4393729
,,,,
12972,Presentation,,Jim Bell,4393729
,,,,
12973,Presentation,"The redemption will take place on December 11, 2020 and covers approximately 63% of the outstanding '21 notes. The voluntary early redemption is consistent with our actions to strengthen enhance our balance sheet, improve our depth profile and optimize our capital structure. In the third quarter, we had $15.1 million of capital expenditures and we continue to focus our capital spending on near term high value strategic projects and men for maintenance and still anticipate that we'll invest approximately $60 million to $65 million in CapExfor the year, some of which is offset by our various vendor support programs.",Jim Bell,4393729
,,,,
12974,Presentation,"Separately today, we also filed a shelf registration statement and established a related optional at the market program to offer and sell up to $100 million of additional common stock. As I noted several times this year, we're extremely pleased with the results we have achieved to strengthen our balance sheet and advance our strategic objectives. And believe we have more than sufficient liquidity and balance sheet strength to continue to execute on these endeavors, as well as navigate through any potential unknown or extended pandemic effects.",Jim Bell,4393729
,,,,
12975,Presentation,"As such, the timing and amount of sales of shares under the program, if any will depend on a variety of factors, including prevailing market conditions, the trading price of shares, and other factors we need to determine. However, as a pragmatic matter initiating this program provides us with the maximum flexibility and optionality to further bolster our balance sheet and liquidity position and increase flexibility gives us the ability to leverage opportunities to accelerate our transformational strategies, such as increasing the speed at which we elevate expand our omni-channel strategy, while further ensuring minimal disruption from any potential further pandemic impacts around the world.",Jim Bell,4393729
,,,,
12976,Presentation,"Before moving to our fourth quarter outlook, I want to spend a few minutes highlighting the initial results of the console launches that occurred in November. By all accounts these consoles are experiencing unprecedented demand, and we continue to work with the suppliers to meet that demand. Importantly, we continue to be able to achieve attachment rates for first party and third-party software and accessories that are in most cases more than two times that of any other competitor, which is leading to us having opportunities to get additional allocations for these high demand consoles.",Jim Bell,4393729
,,,,
12977,Presentation,"Given the strength of our performance so far with the console launch, we expect strong sales growth and profitability in the fourth quarter, something we have not seen in quite a few quarters. As George mentioned, November comparable store sales increased to 16.5%, despite the impact of foreclosures throughout most of Europe and part of Canada in November. In addition, our customers continue to respond favorably to our improved e-commerce experience, including our new app and flexibility of new fulfillment and payment options provided within our elevated omni-channel ecosystem. As a result year-over-year e-commerce sales grew 352% in November versus the same month last year.",Jim Bell,4393729
,,,,
12978,Presentation,"Despite the strong start the fourth quarter, given the uncertainty around the evolving impact of COVID-19, we are continuing to suspend guidance. As we mentioned, we have seen varying levels of closures across our international operations, particularly in Europe and as things remain very fluid in the U.S., temporary store closures due to COVID-19 could be likely heading into the rest of December and January. Keep in mind the comparable store sales exclude the impact of permanent store closures and locations close 14 contiguous days or more due to the pandemic.",Jim Bell,4393729
,,,,
12979,Presentation,"Before I conclude, I wanted to elaborate a little further on our real estate strategy and efforts to optimize our fleet, especially de-densification over-stored markets and how we're approaching further actions. Looking at 2019 and 2020 combined, we will have close over 1000 stores over that timeframe with over 300 in 2019 and nearly 720 in 2020, and importantly have spent little to no capital to do so.",Jim Bell,4393729
,,,,
12980,Presentation,,Jim Bell,4393729
,,,,
12981,Presentation,"With our investments improving our omni-channel capabilities, including hiring almost 30 professionals with extensive digital experience coupled with the impact that COVID-19 has had on our customers' desire to experience GameStop across our digital platforms. We've see opportunity to further optimize a fleet in the coming year or two. These efforts come with EBITDA improvement and we have had a very flexible store based in terms of lease expirations. And that will enable us to close stores at very little cost to the business. We will update you further on these objectives during our fourth quarter and fiscal year-end earnings conference call.",Jim Bell,4393729
,,,,
12982,Presentation,"In summary, we're off to a great start for holiday, and our associates are energized by the buzz and excitement generated by the console launches. We have long said that the newness and consoles and software drive our business, and we see that playing out now. While we are now benefiting from a nice tailwind, we're equally focused on transforming our company for the future and believe we have the right initiatives in place to achieve this goal. Reshaping GameStop for effective market reach and offering a broader range of products and services in a games and entertainment space.",Jim Bell,4393729
,,,,
12983,Presentation,"In the short term, we will remain intently focused on continuing to improve our financial architecture. But today GameStop is a meaningfully be more efficient streamlined organization than it was 15 months ago, due to all the hard work that our teams have done as part of stabilization and optimization components of our strategy. As a result, we believe, we're poised to capitalize on significant profit flow through improvement as we experienced sales growth led by both the generation nine console launch and expected new software title slate, as well as the expansion of the transformation phase of our strategy and many exciting category product extensions and services, we will bring into our ecosystem in 2021 and beyond.",Jim Bell,4393729
,,,,
12984,Presentation,I will now turn the call over to the operator and we'll take any questions that you may have.,Jim Bell,4393729
,,,,
12985,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. We will now be having our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Stephanie Wissink with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.,Operator,4393729
,,,,
12986,Question-and-Answer,"Hi, this is Ashley Helgans for Steph Wissink. Thanks for taking our questions. On The SG&A reduction, you've been running about 100 million a quarter, what should we expect for pacing by quarter going forward? And what are the reaming cost buckets to address? And then how -- just on your performance in the quarter, how did it benchmark to industry figures of third-party data sources like NPD? Thanks.",Ashley Helgans,4393729
,,,,
12987,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, Hi, Ashley, thanks for the questions. With respect to SG&A, I mean, look, again -- we continue to address, as you know, for several quarters now addressing SG&A in virtually every facet of business. So it's not going to -- won't be that different from the contribution of expenses for any quarter, as we've seen historically because we're really removing costs out of the entirety of the system. A lot of it is stores coming offline, a lot of it is productivity and our labor forces, both in the stores of DC, all aspects of our corporate G&A. So, it really is everywhere. So, I don't know that that's going to change very much at all based on the history.",George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
12988,Question-and-Answer,"And I'm sorry, second part of the question was?",George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
12989,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, thank you. That was helpful, but the second part of the question was just on the performance in the quarter, how did you benchmark to industry figures like NPD?",Ashley Helgans,4393729
,,,,
12990,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, I'm not exactly sure how to comment the benchmark point. But I mean, look, I think, again, I think the quarter was in line with our expectations. And if you go back, just go back a year, I mean, when we first got here last summer and we set out on this journey, we said, look, these next four quarters will be representative of exactly what we just saw and they met our expectations.",George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
12991,Question-and-Answer,,George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
12992,Question-and-Answer,"And then more importantly, what happens at the end of a cycle as we then transition, the next one is, we're not competing on price at the end of a cycle. So again, it's a balance, but importantly, I think, the third quarter is behind this now. And I think the most important point here is that we are indexing very well, as we launched into the November timeframe and the launch of these consoles. I think that's the critical message today is that we've made that transition, and we're laser focused on moving forward.",George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
12993,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, I think that's right. I mean, I think all I'd add is that, we knew that we're at the end of --- we're going to experience some voidance in hardware as we got to the end of the cycle without the proper generations in place in any kind of quantity. We had some software titles moved from Q3 to Q4, and we are we've affected during this pandemic. So, I mean, very clearly as waves breakout across the country, we feel the impact of that, as shoppers become less, less comfortable, particularly going to a specialty store for especially purchase.",Jim Bell,4393729
,,,,
12994,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you. And if I could just squeeze in one more. E-com representing 18% in the next quarter, how much of the online business is now fulfilled from stores?",Ashley Helgans,4393729
,,,,
12995,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, it's -- that's not a stat that we've actually supplied. But suffice it to say, it actually fluctuates. And this is important because it's based on what the consumer is demanding. And so, if it's a shift from store or buy online, pick up in store and direct to consumer element or absolute footfall into the box itself from a traffic pure POS traffic standpoint. Again, I think it's fluctuating. That's important. That's what exactly what we mean by a frictionless, digitally-led omni-channel retailer is letting the consumer pick when they want the product when we deliver to them.",George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
12996,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.,Operator,4393729
,,,,
12997,Question-and-Answer,"I mean, clearly a lot of progress being made with e-commerce and with expense controls. So as it pertains to the transformation plan, I wonder, if you could provide some context and how this differs from what was outlined in the letter to the board? Because at face value, it seems like there's a fair bit of overlap in terms of the shift to digital first and shrinking the store base? That's my first question.",Colin Sebastian,4393729
,,,,
12998,Question-and-Answer,"What I'll only comment on our progress, as we see it, Reboot today and where we are today. We look at the business and we feel quite good about the financial stability measures that have been taken place. Over the period of Reboot, we reduced long-term debt by well over $500 million. We've returned $200 million to the shareholders through buybacks, which represents about 37% of the Company. We ended the quarter with about $300 million more cash than same quarter last year.",George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
12999,Question-and-Answer,"And that's been a trend. I mean, that's something that's been pretty continuous throughout the Reboot process. Just prior question, your SG&A run rate of reduction seems to be $100 million, of quarter, yes, it does. I mean, that's very much an important part of getting where he used to be. And then the progress that we've made on working capital has been tremendous. Unfortunately, that began at the very beginning of Reboot 15 months ago, and what that's done to allow us to navigate through this pandemic is that I cannot overstate.",George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
13000,Question-and-Answer,"So, on the economic stability or financial stability front and good, we've made nice progress on digital for sure, from an e-commerce standpoint. We were behind. I mean, we were clearly behind in terms of digital penetration of sales. We are behind in terms of technology. We still are very candid about having work to do, but we've come a long, long way very, very quickly, so the up 257% for Q3 to have penetration at that level and really spiking to certainly higher than that, during peak periods.",George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
13001,Question-and-Answer,,George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
13002,Question-and-Answer,"To have made investments in our e-commerce capability, both in terms of the platforms and human capital that's driving it. The capability expansion that we've made, at least to own options, flexible payment terms of proprietary credit cards, all better alternatives for the customer how to shop. And then just kind of looking ahead, while this generation of console launches is very, very important to us and it is, and the demand is unprecedented and it clearly is. We're working to be defined not purely as a console gaming retailer. But as disturbing the entire gaming community I call the various verticals.",George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
13003,Question-and-Answer,"So, we're glad to see sales of 16.5% despite being closed on Thanksgiving Day and being very comfortable in that decision to close on Thanksgiving Day. We have a wide category expansion that both Jim and I mentioned during the course of our comments that are progressing well and then really good progress on the digital first omni-channel store fleet optimization work. So, we look back, we feel pretty good about where we are and are poised for the next phase of work.",George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
13004,Question-and-Answer,"I mean just to put a finer point on it. Again, the second pillar that we launched in Reboot last year, in the August, September timeframe was to build a frictionless digital ecosystem. That's exactly what we've done. That is leading with technology, leading with a digital footprint that optimizes our e-commerce evolution, through the investments in data and technology as well as how it balances with right foot for the stores. We launched that when we got here launched our Reboot program. So, I think that's the point George made, we did, and we've been making some real strides against it.",Jim Bell,4393729
,,,,
13005,Question-and-Answer,"Thanks. So that's helpful. In the release, there's some commentary around providing growth in reference to 2021. So I just wanted to clarify, if that's specifically referencing sales volumes next year or something else?",Colin Sebastian,4393729
,,,,
13006,Question-and-Answer,It's absolutely referencing sales volumes next year.,Jim Bell,4393729
,,,,
13007,Question-and-Answer,Okay.,Colin Sebastian,4393729
,,,,
13008,Question-and-Answer,"And I say, two part response to that. First of all, we have growth initiatives in place. Second of all, the console launch is not a Q4 phenomenon. As you all know, I mean, I think there'll be great carry forward demand into the entirety of next year and beyond.",George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
13009,Question-and-Answer,"Okay, and then lastly. Do you have target for the cash balance expected at the end of the fiscal year?",Colin Sebastian,4393729
,,,,
13010,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, we haven't put it out there, but I will just say consistent with the trajectory that we've been on.",George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
13011,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. Our next question comes from William Reuter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.,Operator,4393729
,,,,
13012,Question-and-Answer,"Hi, I just had two quick ones. The first is and I don't think the question was asked this way. In terms of the November performance, was it in line with your expectations?",William Reuter,4393729
,,,,
13013,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, certainly was in line with expectations. Again, we knowingly took a chunk out of that by closing on Thanksgiving. I think it's fair to say that in this environment, the sales compression that you might sometimes see is not prep work. So we knew that that was going to be an investment in our people and into safety. And we don't second guess that for a moment. So yes, if you make that change, it is in line with our expectations.",George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
13014,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. And then, in terms of the new shelf, I saw that you mentioned general corporate purposes. Would you consider issuing stocks to repay debt under that program?",William Reuter,4393729
,,,,
13015,Question-and-Answer,"No, that's absolutely not the intent. The intent here is to simply optimize flexibility and optionality period. There is a lot of unknowns going on in the marketplace with respect to this pandemic, ongoing flex of cases across the world, the impacts on our own businesses, and we're not immune to that, right. And in that regard, look, we're going to continue to execute our strategies have bolstered and strengthen our balance sheet.",George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
13016,Question-and-Answer,,George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
13017,Question-and-Answer,"And you see all the work that we've done, including, if we go back to even the long-term debt levels in early 2019 until today, it's -- as of this coming Friday will have reduced our long term debt over $530 million, by March of '21, they'll be over $600 million in that same timeframe, that same roughly 24 month timeframe, plus or minus. We also returned over $200 million to shareholders.",George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
13018,Question-and-Answer,"So I think, look, the goal is to continue to focus on running the business and optimizing we run the business, but also be very pragmatic and make sure that we have capital flexibility with no intention to do anything other than maintain our flexibility. Hopefully that helps you.",George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
13019,Question-and-Answer,"Certainly, we don't need it. Yes, absolutely. We don't need it.",Jim Bell,4393729
,,,,
13020,Question-and-Answer,"And as I mentioned, last Friday's of the first voluntary early redemption of $125 million of the remaining March '21 notes.",George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
13021,Question-and-Answer,"Great, I'll pass to others. Thanks so much.",William Reuter,4393729
,,,,
13022,Question-and-Answer,Thank you.,George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
13023,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group. Please proceed with your question.,Operator,4393729
,,,,
13024,Question-and-Answer,"With regard to the consoles, how did your allocation compare to prior cycles? I mean, presumably you sold every single unit that you got. Is there still, I assume there's still a very heavy backlog and what are your thoughts on allocation through the rest of the period? We know Sony has come out and said that they plant produce more. So can you share any thoughts on that?",Joe Feldman,4393729
,,,,
13025,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. I think that the demand has been unbelievable, Joe, as you mentioned. And we don't see any end of that insight. So certainly, these are fabulous pieces of technology. The demand is terrific for it. Any allocation that we get and I think I've mentioned this on past calls the answer is we always want more. I will say the competitive set has changed between console launches really with the evolution of direct to consumer from the OEMs themselves.",George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
13026,Question-and-Answer,"So that tells you a bit about what the allocations look like versus last time around, but we're playing meaningfully, which was our objective and we're winning well. So I think one area in a point of differentiation for us, and it's been part of our premise all along is we attach differently. So, when you look at accessories, first party software, we attached differently and that's been recognized, and we have seen some level of a reward for that and we expect it to be a differentiating point for us going forward in terms of allocation.",George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
13027,Question-and-Answer,"And then just another question with regard to the cash balance, I mean, I know that some of its restricted, but yes, 603 million, presumably, you generated more in the fourth quarter. Let's say, we're getting through this cycle with the pandemic. I understand the next couple of months are going to be rough. But I guess, how are you thinking about cash allocation or cash usage at this point? I know we've talked to people that are hoping you were going to buy back more stock in the coming year, so or return to that. So I guess I'm curious how we should think about that going forward?",Joe Feldman,4393729
,,,,
13028,Question-and-Answer,"Thanks, Joe. The short answer is, again, nothing's off the table. I mean, our job is to find the optimum balance of capital allocation, which starts with ultimately the investment in the transformation of the business for future growth and profitability. That's the first point, and we'll continue to do that. And if it means accelerating those investments to bring that return in a more rapid fashion we?ll do that, it also is the fine balance of the capitalization of the business.",George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
13029,Question-and-Answer,"And ultimately, what is the right level of debt? We think we're approaching that after we get done paying down the rest of these March 21. And then outside of that, certainly always consideration to return capital to shareholders, as well as we've proven like I said, last year in 2019 returned over $200 million a share, which I think every one of those is on the table. We are always looking to find the optimum balance of capital allocation.",George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
13030,Question-and-Answer,,George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
13031,Question-and-Answer,"And just to kind of add the obvious the underlying environment matters certainly we don't know what a few more months means right now. We're obviously encouraged by a vaccine, just like all of you are, but we see more impact ahead. And we don't know the exact timelines or protocols for that nor does anybody at this point. So we look at something that we have to be guarded about into the future is there's no particular end date insight yet. This is something we're going to be dealing with for the indefinite future.",Jim Bell,4393729
,,,,
13032,Question-and-Answer,Thanks and good luck with this holiday season.,Joe Feldman,4393729
,,,,
13033,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. Our next question comes from Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.,Operator,4393729
,,,,
13034,Question-and-Answer,"I wanted to follow up on the Q4 commentary. And I just want to confirm the language here. So in the release you talked about positive year-over-year sales growth. I just want to confirm, are you guiding to year-over-year profitability growth as well?",Seth Sigman,4393729
,,,,
13035,Question-and-Answer,"We're not guiding to anything, the comment was specific to growth and profitability in the fourth quarter. And just to be clear, again, we're not guiding to anything. Again it's, I think we've been pretty straightforward on that.",George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
13036,Question-and-Answer,"Your sales year-over-year is in, I mean, you're saying sales year-over-year will grow and there's a comment about profitability. I'm just trying to confirm are you saying year-over-year profit growth, in addition to year-over-year sales growth?",Seth Sigman,4393729
,,,,
13037,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, it was just notation was for the fourth quarter.",George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
13038,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, for the fourth quarter I'm asking.",Seth Sigman,4393729
,,,,
13039,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, that's correct.",George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
13040,Question-and-Answer,"Okay, so year-over-year profit growth. So then the related question is, given the unfavorable mix of hardware, would you expect gross profit to be up as well? Obviously, you're going to have some mixed impact here. Comps are going to be up but you do have the negative mix. So gross profit up or is it really coming from the cost savings?",Seth Sigman,4393729
,,,,
13041,Question-and-Answer,"A little bit of both, gross dollar, gross profit dollars, because look, we're talking about volume rate, so you get a little bit of from the overall top line as a flow through, but then you also take advantage of the flow through the bottom line as a result of your expense structure. That's a lot more optimized than it was last year.",George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
13042,Question-and-Answer,"Okay, interesting. Okay. And then just a follow-up question on the market share question earlier, your growth rate did seem to trail the industry per-NPD. I'm just curious, what would be causing that you feel like, ecommerce even though it's clearly progressing? You feel like that's been one of the reasons for lagging or anything else that you would highlight? And then, of course, with all the initiatives, I'm curious, what do you think is going to be most incremental to regain share, as you sort of look out over the next 12 months or so?",Seth Sigman,4393729
,,,,
13043,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, look, I think there are periods during the course of Q3, certainly for us during the pandemic, where we certainly are aware of the fact that we lost some share. We've had close stores, we've had a competitive situation where some of our competitors were open for business that we weren't. And you've got a very guarded shopping environment, obviously, as it applies to the brick and mortar aspect of our business where there's a reluctance, there's a significant decrease in footfalls across retail in general. And we're not immune to that in any way, shape, or manner. So I think you've got a prescribed shopping trip to GameStop to get gaming, and you've got a general trip elsewhere for multiple purposes. I think that probably is factored in.",George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
13044,Question-and-Answer,"On the flip side, again, when there's newness in the marketplace, we excel, we tend to lead in market share for those software releases those new game releases. So that is our strength. We actually believe that we're going to be in a position to begin to claw back market share going forward. As we cycle some of those closure careers as we're able to get customers back in stores and lovers the full omni-channel suite that we offer now. We've gained, certainly through our increases on ecommerce, but there's still a significant impact on the brick and mortar aspect of the business right now and there will be for a while longer.",George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
13045,Question-and-Answer,,George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
13046,Question-and-Answer,"I just had one comment in the market share piece, I mean if you look at the cyclicality back in 2013 2014 Gen 7, Gen 8 transition period, you'll saw at the end of the cycle, we tend to lose a little bit more a couple points of market share and at the beginning of the cycle, we gain those points of market share and the reason, a huge reason for that and that is our expectations we head forward. But a big reason for that is again, the technical consultation of our expert gaming associates, they're in the stores. And that's important with the advancements of this technology.",Jim Bell,4393729
,,,,
13047,Question-and-Answer,Our next question comes from Curtis Nagle with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.,Operator,4393729
,,,,
13048,Question-and-Answer,"I just wanted to continue digging on the comment about the 16.5 comp in November. And I just how to think about how the rest of the quarter plays out? November was, obviously the quarter when it was launched. I think at least it's going to be the only quarter where the industry will see a material sell-through due to the shortages. And in November, it likely brought a lot of traffic into stores and websites. So think about December or January, where you and your peers are likely to have a ton of supply, at least I think. Do you think you see reversal traffic? How do we think about comps and positive? What's the setup for those first few months, where again, you just don't have that the traffic driver in any materiality?",Curtis Nagle,4393729
,,,,
13049,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, I think, first of all, let's take any potential effects, unknown components of a pandemic off the table, because what we've seen time and time, again, that it affects retail mobility. So let's just assume no one knows the impact of that, take it off the table. And a very simple fact outside of that is that, again, we're continuing to execute here in the fourth quarter, this is not a couple of weeks in the month of November. So to be clear, that's not what this isn't and it's certainly not the fourth quarter either. As George said earlier, this is a multiyear evolution here and this is just the beginning",Jim Bell,4393729
,,,,
13050,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, look at there's going to be impact on December, as you know. I mean, you've likely heard about global supply chain issues on every call that you've been on, and it certainly is a fact. And it is a mitigating factor, but we have newness in December. We have a release coming up in two days, called Cyberpunk 2077, which is a big driver for us. And we certainly believe that there are other events that will drive traffic in the month of December. That will continue this.",George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
13051,Question-and-Answer,"Again, I don't want to miss not playing to the fact that we have added so much customer flexibility, both in delivery options and payment options, these are all resonating incredibly well with our consumers and giving us an advantage. So again, this is how you take advantage of a full omni-channel execution. So that, those are continuing to be part of our business as we move in through December and beyond as well.",Jim Bell,4393729
,,,,
13052,Question-and-Answer,"And then just as a quick follow-up. Any commentary on the use business how does that trend over 3Q? And I guess, how is the hardware portion of that segment doing? Maybe seeing a little bit of boost near-term, just given supply constraints across both our next and current gen consoles? And how software is performing well?",Curtis Nagle,4393729
,,,,
13053,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, on the hardware side, for the third quarter as should be expected, I mean, again, you've got lower supply almost. As we go forward and what I mean by is our ability to intake. When our stores are closed, we're not in taking pre-owned hardware, right? I mean, that's just a natural equation. However, as we're navigating through this launch, a big part of that is our engagement with our customers with pre-owned product and so we're positioning quite well. And I think what's different though, as we go forward this time around, is that the OEMs are not making a prior gen product anymore, and that's critical, because if you want a prior gen product, a lot of people do, there's demand in that marketplace. We are really your shop to go get that.",Jim Bell,4393729
,,,,
13054,Question-and-Answer,,Jim Bell,4393729
,,,,
13055,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, I emphasize that last point. We're bullish on pre-owned hardware for just that reason, and just again, go back in time a little bit, the intake issue is pretty self-explanatory. We have pre-sales and then we have launch events for new next generation consoles. You're not going to get my old console until I get my new console. So there's an inherent delay in that happening. And then it does. And that's where we are right now is kind of in the fulfillment and high demand phase, working from those preorders, but really in a very construction environment going for, but we actually think that this can be a bit of a renaissance for pre-owned gaming with the absence of the older generation consoles out there. And we have them so we can remain a factor them.",George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
13056,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the floor back over to George Sherman for any closing remarks.,Operator,4393729
,,,,
13057,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, let me have Jim to make one quick comment and then we'll close off the call.",George Sherman,4393729
,,,,
13058,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, I just wanted to call your attention. This quarter, we added as we're making this transformation, we added some slides to our IR website. So, I'll call your attention to those that continues to iterate and layout for all of you at this our journey. So, please take a reference to those George.",Jim Bell,4393729
,,,,
13059,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, thanks to everyone, wishing you a safe and happy holiday. It's obviously been a quite an unusual year. Hope you have a great end it. I want to kind of layout our communications cadence going forward. We will provide you with holiday sales results in early January and then more details regarding our strategy and our work at the ICR conference happening virtually in January and again following our fourth quarter year-end results.",George Sherman,4393729

13067,Presentation,We will now begin with remarks from Wahid Nawabi. Wahid?,Steven Gitlin,4393726
,,,,
13068,Presentation,"Thank you, Steve. Welcome to our second quarter fiscal year 2021 earnings conference call. Before we discuss our business achievements in the second quarter, I would like to address our acquisition of the German robotics company, Telerob, which we announced a few moments ago and is summarized on Slide number 3 of our earnings presentation. ",Wahid Nawabi,4393726
,,,,
13069,Presentation,"Telerob is a leader in advanced ground robotic systems with a strong global customer base and a best-in-class portfolio of unmanned ground vehicles or UGVs serving defense, first response, homeland security and other markets. ",Wahid Nawabi,4393726
,,,,
13070,Presentation,This is an outstanding growing business in its own right that is poised for further success in the United States and globally and we are excited for them to join our team to support our customers and expand our global footprint. ,Wahid Nawabi,4393726
,,,,
13071,Presentation,"At AeroVironment, our goal is to drive superior shareholder value by developing and maintaining leadership positions in intelligent multi-domain robotic systems for defense, civil and commercial customers. Our broad portfolio includes unmanned aircraft and tactical missile systems that are aerial robots with increasing levels of intelligence and autonomy that derive from our ongoing investments. ",Wahid Nawabi,4393726
,,,,
13072,Presentation,,Wahid Nawabi,4393726
,,,,
13073,Presentation,"Telerob?s outstanding team, best-in-class product portfolio, long track record of success and extensive customer base represents an ideal complementary set of capabilities that deliver the ground element of our multi-domain portfolio. Telerob was founded more than 25 years ago and its management team has extensive robotic experience that date back to the 1970s. ",Wahid Nawabi,4393726
,,,,
13074,Presentation,"The Telerob team has built an impressive list of customers around the world by applying their innovative robotics technologies to multiple growing applications and end-markets. With Telerob, as part of AeroVironment, we will offer a broader set of solutions and capabilities to our customers. ",Wahid Nawabi,4393726
,,,,
13075,Presentation,"Once the transaction closes, we plan to integrate our technology roadmaps to develop aerial and ground system solutions that deliver more capability in more complex operating environments to customers in defense and other applications. ",Wahid Nawabi,4393726
,,,,
13076,Presentation,"With this powerful multi-domain solution offering, we will introduce AeroVironment to Telerob?s existing customer base, which spans 45 nations and introduce Telerob?s unique portfolio to AeroVironment customers in the U.S. and 50 nations. ",Wahid Nawabi,4393726
,,,,
13077,Presentation,"To this point, in November, we submitted a joint proposal with Telerob to the U.S. air force for a large new multi-year explosive ordinance disposal of robotics program where AeroVironment will be the prime contractor. The air force has not disclosed the potential value of this program, but it is significant. ",Wahid Nawabi,4393726
,,,,
13078,Presentation,"We will also pursue additional significant domestic UGV opportunities with the United States Navy, Marine Corps, Air National Guard and various police forces. ",Wahid Nawabi,4393726
,,,,
13079,Presentation,"Specific international opportunities include, UGVs for airport security in the Middle Eastern allied nations and multiple UAS programs with the German Federal Ministry of Defense, which a local presence would support. As you can see, the opportunities between our two teams are numerous and have the potential to produce significant value for AeroVironment shareholders in the near and long-term. ",Wahid Nawabi,4393726
,,,,
13080,Presentation,"Upon German government clearance of the transaction, which we expect by spring 2021, Telerob will operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of AeroVironment. We?ve planned to retain the entire Telerob team. We expect this acquisition to be GAAP EPS accretive in two years and non-GAAP EPS accretive in fiscal year 2022 excluding intangible amortization and integration costs. ",Wahid Nawabi,4393726
,,,,
13081,Presentation,"Under the terms of the agreement, we are investing approximately $45.4 million in cash, plus a three year milestone-based earn out of up to $7.3 million. We will also pay off $9.4 million in debt from Telerob at closing. ",Wahid Nawabi,4393726
,,,,
13082,Presentation,"Our acquisition of Telerob supports our objectives of deploying our strong balance sheet to grow our business, expanding the value proposition of our offerings and creating long term shareholder value. I look forward to sharing more with you as we proceed toward closing. ",Wahid Nawabi,4393726
,,,,
13083,Presentation,"Now I will summarize our second quarter results. On today?s call, I will emphasize three key messages included on slide number 4 of our earnings presentation. First, our team continues to deliver strong results during the unprecedented and challenging COVID-19 pandemic, keeping us on track to achieve our fiscal year 2021 objectives. ",Wahid Nawabi,4393726
,,,,
13084,Presentation,"Second, we achieved significant milestones during the quarter in our key growth initiatives within tactical UAS, tactical missile systems, and HAPS. And third, we are successfully executing our long-term growth strategy supported by our strong balance sheet while delivering significant value to our shareholders. ",Wahid Nawabi,4393726
,,,,
13085,Presentation,"Now let?s review our financial performance in the quarter, which is outlined on slide number 5 of our earnings presentation. We delivered second quarter revenue of $92.7 million, an increase of 11% year-over-year and consistent with our expectations. ",Wahid Nawabi,4393726
,,,,
13086,Presentation,,Wahid Nawabi,4393726
,,,,
13087,Presentation,"Earnings per diluted share of $0.09 declined from $0.31 in the prior year, primarily due to an accounting impairment related to our portion of a write-down in HAPSMobiles Inc.?s equity investment and Loon LLC. Kevin will provide more information on this item in his prepared comments. ",Wahid Nawabi,4393726
,,,,
13088,Presentation,"Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share for the second quarter was $0.48, an increase of $0.14 or 41% year-over-year. ",Wahid Nawabi,4393726
,,,,
13089,Presentation,"Now I will review our business achievements in the second quarter. First, our small unmanned aircraft systems product line represented 63% of total revenue in the second quarter and we remain the leader in the global market for small UAS. We continue to partner with industry leaders to deliver more valuable solutions to our customers. ",Wahid Nawabi,4393726
,,,,
13090,Presentation,"In October, we announced the contract with Viasat to develop an on-demand, Type 1 encrypted communications network delivered by small UAS for the U.S. Army. This is another example of our applied innovation creating greater value for our customers and shareholders. ",Wahid Nawabi,4393726
,,,,
13091,Presentation,"Next our tactical missile systems product line represented about 20% of second quarter revenue. We continue to execute against the large army LMAMS contract with our Switchblade 300 during the quarter. In recent years, DOD procurement budgets have provided strong funding for army LMAMS procurement. This funding has driven programmatic adoption of Switchblade 300 via the U.S. Army.",Wahid Nawabi,4393726
,,,,
13092,Presentation,"In this fiscal year 2021 procurement request, the U.S. Department of Defense budget proposed about $85 million of funding to support the army LMAMS program. Senate and House of representatives appropriations committees recently proposed reducing or eliminating LMAMS funding in government fiscal year 2021, partly because significant funding remains from prior budget for LMAMS procurement.",Wahid Nawabi,4393726
,,,,
13093,Presentation,"Weeks back the entire $85 million to be removed by the time the budget is enacted into law, but we?ll not know for certain until then. It is important to note that a new multi-year competitive LMAMS program is planned to begin after fiscal year 2021. We believe we are well positioned to compete for and secure that award. ",Wahid Nawabi,4393726
,,,,
13094,Presentation,"In October, we unveiled our Switchblade family of loitering missile systems including our new Switchblade 600, which is the larger variant we have previously discussed. Switchblade 600 weighs 50 pounds, carries a much larger warhead than Switchblade 300 is capable of more than 40 minutes of endurance and delivers precision effects against armored vehicles and other hardened targets over greater distance, all while maintaining its portability and patented wave-off and recommit capabilities. ",Wahid Nawabi,4393726
,,,,
13095,Presentation,"As part of the Switchblade 600 system, we also introduced a new tablet touch control that improves the user experience and makes training even faster and easier. With Switchblade 600, we are targeting a tactical missiles market segment valued at more than $1 billion annually, based on current U.S. DOD procurement of Hellfire, Javelin and TOW missiles. ",Wahid Nawabi,4393726
,,,,
13096,Presentation,"Developed in part with customer funding, we believe that Switchblade 600 is well positioned for the U.S. Marine Corp?s Organic Precision Fires Mounted for OPFM program. Supporting our competition for OPFM, we received a $5 million award late last fiscal year and another $1 million award in the second quarter. ",Wahid Nawabi,4393726
,,,,
13097,Presentation,"Importantly, these funds are separate and in addition to customer funding we have received for Switchblade 600 development. We are now one of four suppliers who will compete as soon as this February for a down-select award. That award will fund continuous development that could lead to low rate production and in volume procurement over a multi-year period. ",Wahid Nawabi,4393726
,,,,
13098,Presentation,"Moving now to HAPS which represented 12% of second quarter revenue which is a significant project milestone in September when the Sunglider?s solar HAPS UAS soared into stratosphere for hours during a 20 hour mission at Spaceport America in New Mexico. During this successful test flight, we also demonstrated broadband connectivity via an LTE payload carried onboard the Sunglider. ",Wahid Nawabi,4393726
,,,,
13099,Presentation,,Wahid Nawabi,4393726
,,,,
13100,Presentation,"In fact, we conducted video calls from New Mexico that connected us to Tokyo, Silicon Valley and Washington DC using a standard android smartphone. The quality of the video call was as good if not better than most video meetings I have participated in from my office. This milestone offers a glimpse into the exciting possibilities HAPS represents for connecting the billions of people around the world who lack basic broadband access. ",Wahid Nawabi,4393726
,,,,
13101,Presentation,We remain confident that this partnership would deliver strong returns for our shareholders. We expect the HAPS program to transition to a testing and certification phase towards the end of our current fiscal year 2021. We expect this testing and certification phase to continue for multiple years until we transition to production and commercial business launch. ,Wahid Nawabi,4393726
,,,,
13102,Presentation,Now I will turn to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. We continue to experience some delays in customer contracting decisions as our domestic and international customers operate in unprecedented remote work situations. We are also experiencing some delays in limited areas of our supply chains resulting from the impacts of the pandemic. ,Wahid Nawabi,4393726
,,,,
13103,Presentation,"However, our teams? accomplishments in the important milestones they achieved during the quarter are particularly noteworthy given the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority of our team members continue to work remotely and I am incredibly proud of the way they have continued to support each other and our customers. ",Wahid Nawabi,4393726
,,,,
13104,Presentation,All of us at AeroVironment are united and our commitment to delivering strong operating and financial results while maintaining a safe work environment. This was a solid quarter of achievements. We are very excited about our acquisition of Telerob and the progress toward our multi-domain intelligent robotic portfolio it will drive.,Wahid Nawabi,4393726
,,,,
13105,Presentation,"And as you can see, we are not standing still. We continue to invest in the future-defining technologies that will drive higher levels of autonomy and capability for our customers and greater returns for our shareholders. ",Wahid Nawabi,4393726
,,,,
13106,Presentation,"Now, I will turn the call over to Kevin McDonnell for a summary of second quarter financials. Kevin? ",Wahid Nawabi,4393726
,,,,
13107,Presentation,"Thank you, Wahid. Today, I'll be reviewing the highlights of our second quarter and year-to-date financial performance. I'll be referring to both our press release and earnings presentation available on our website. ",Kevin McDonnell,4393726
,,,,
13108,Presentation,"Similar to last quarter, I will only be addressing the key financial metrics in my remarks and leaving some of the details in the press release and earnings presentation.",Kevin McDonnell,4393726
,,,,
13109,Presentation,"Revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 was $92.7 million, an increase of 11% from the second quarter of fiscal 2020 revenue of $83.3 million. The breakdown of revenue by product area is contained on Slide 6 of the quarterly earnings presentation. ",Kevin McDonnell,4393726
,,,,
13110,Presentation,"During the quarter we showed strong performance in our TMS product line, which was up 139% from the same period last year. This was partially offset by lower HAPSMobile service revenue and lower Small UAS product revenue.",Kevin McDonnell,4393726
,,,,
13111,Presentation,"Revenue for the first half of fiscal 2021 was $180.1 million, an increase of 6% from the first half of fiscal 2020 revenue of $170.2 million. Again the increase in revenue was largely due to an increase in TMS revenue partially offset by reduced small UAS product revenue. ",Kevin McDonnell,4393726
,,,,
13112,Presentation,"Turning to gross margin, Slide 7 of the quarterly earnings presentation shows our product, service mix and overall gross margin trends over the past five quarters.

13113,Presentation,"Gross margin for the first half of fiscal 2021 was $76.3 million or 42% of revenue, compared to $76.4 million or 45% of revenue for the first half of fiscal 2020. As we indicated last quarter, we do expect second half margins to be lower than the first half margins due to a less favorable product mix. ",Kevin McDonnell,4393726

13115,Presentation,"Now I will turn to operating expense. SG&A expense for the second quarter was $15 million or 16% of revenue, compared to SG&A expense of $16.3 million or 20% of revenue for the second quarter of FY 2020. SG&A expense for the first half of fiscal 2021 was $27 million or 15% of revenue, compared to $29.9 million or 18% of revenue for the first half of fiscal 2020. ",Kevin McDonnell,4393726
,,,,
13116,Presentation,The lower spend in current quarter and year-to-date SG&A is in large part related to the reduction in travel and trade show expenses resulting from COVID-related restrictions. ,Kevin McDonnell,4393726

13117,Presentation,"R&D expense for the second quarter was $12 million or 13% of revenue, compared to R&D expense of $10.9 million or 13% of revenue for the second quarter FY 2020.

,,,,
13119,Presentation,"Before I talk about the bottom-line, I?d like to discuss the impact of the HAPSMobile JV on our income statement. As a reminder, we own approximately 7% of the HAPSMobile joint venture. In the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we recorded a loss of $9.5 million related to our investment in the HAPSMobile JV. ",Kevin McDonnell,4393726
,,,,
13120,Presentation,"This includes an $8.4 million impairment loss, which represents our proportionate share of the HAPSMobile write-down of its investment in Alphabet Loon?s subsidiary.

",Kevin McDonnell,4393726
,,,,
13121,Presentation,"Finally, I should note that our accumulated losses in the JV have resulted in the carrying amount of our investment on the balance sheet to be zero as at the end of the second quarter and therefore we will not recognize any further losses related to our investment to-date in the HAPSMobile JV in future periods.

13122,Presentation,"Looking at the bottom-line, net income attributable to AeroVironment for the second quarter of fiscal 20201 was $2.1 million or $0.09 per diluted share compared to $7.5 million or $0.31 per diluted share for the second quarter of fiscal 2020. ",Kevin McDonnell,4393726
,,,,
13123,Presentation,"The $5.4 million reduction in net income was largely a result of our proportionate portion of the HAPSMobile impairment of its investment in Loon of $8.4 million, higher tax provision of $1.4 million, increased R&D investments of $1.1 million and reduced interest income of $1.2 million. ",Kevin McDonnell,4393726
,,,,
13124,Presentation,"These reductions were partially offset by higher gross margins of $5.7 million and lower SG&A spending of $1.3 million. For the first half of fiscal 2021, net income attributable to AeroVironment was $12.2 million or $0.50 per diluted share, compared to $24.6 million or $1.02 per diluted share for the first half of fiscal 2020. ",Kevin McDonnell,4393726
,,,,
13125,Presentation,"The $12.4 million reduction in net income is again primarily due to the $8.4 million loss from our portion of the HAPSMobile impairment of its investment in Loon, together with higher R&D spending of $3.5 million and lower interest income of $2.3 million, partially offset by lower SG&A spending of $2.9 million.

13133,Presentation,"The working capital improvement came primarily from lower accounts receivables and unbillables, partially offset by lower accounts payable, accrued liabilities and higher inventories.

,,,,
13134,Presentation,"Next I'd like to highlight some of our backlog metrics. Our funded backlog at the end of Q2 was $130.6 million, a decrease of $16.1 million from the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and a decrease of $77.5 million from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 backlog of $208.1 million.

,,,,
13150,Presentation,"Kevin, Steve, and I will now take your questions.",Wahid Nawabi,4393726
,,,,
13151,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you, Wahid. We will now begin the question and answer session of today?s call. [Operator Instructions] Our first question this afternoon comes from Ken Herbert at Canaccord Genuity. Ken?",A - Steven Gitlin,4393726
,,,,
13152,Question-and-Answer,"Hi, Steve. Good afternoon everybody. ",Ken Herbert,4393726
,,,,
13153,Question-and-Answer,"Good afternoon, Ken. ",Wahid Nawabi,4393726
,,,,
13154,Question-and-Answer,"Wahid, I just wanted to first ask on LMAMS, if in fact the fiscal 2021 budget has zeroed out the funding, can you just remind us how much of the appropriated money has not yet been spent and what that contribution you think for your full year 2021 what the guidance implies from the LMAMS contract for the year? ",Ken Herbert,4393726
,,,,
13155,Question-and-Answer,"Sure, Ken. So, as I mentioned in my remark, the original budget line item request was roughly about $85 million. The House of Representative recommended $69 million roughly. And then, the senate has actually put a zero on that line item as a recommendation. Now, none of this is final. So, the actual authorization is still is around the $69 million, but what gets appropriated is what?s going to matter.",Wahid Nawabi,4393726
,,,,
13156,Question-and-Answer,"No one really knows exactly what will be appropriated. We are in very close contact with our customer. There is still ? we are planning on it being zeroed out essentially. However, the reason why I said in my remarks that there is since still significant funds remaining, this is because we?ve had significant dollars of funding on fiscal 2019, fiscal 2020, even beyond before that, there is a significant amount of dollars that are not still awarded to us as part of the existing JUONs contract that we have. That?s number one. Number two, we do have the details in terms of how much revenue we recognize, I believe Steve, you have the specific details of that that you can just iterate for this year. But we are still expecting to achieve our full fiscal year expectation on the Switchblade 300 based on the contract that we have today. So, there is not going to be, in our view, no change on that as of today. We believe that we are going to be able to execute on that. And we are currently executing that as we speak anyway. ",Wahid Nawabi,4393726
,,,,
13157,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. Great. And if I could, just a follow-up really quickly on Telerob, it?s looks like a nice acquisition. Can you provide any more details in terms of has the business been growing sort of in line with the 15% that you called out for the UGV industry or anything we should ? we can think about in terms of the potential revenue contribution of this business once the deal is closed. Thank you. ",Ken Herbert,4393726
,,,,
13158,Question-and-Answer,,Ken Herbert,4393726
,,,,
13159,Question-and-Answer,"Sure, Ken. So, we are ? I am personally extremely excited and bullish about this acquisition. It makes a whole lot of sense in terms of long-term shareholder value creation. It?s the right move for us strategically. Then there is tremendous amount of synergies on the revenue side and on the top-line. In terms of the business itself, first and foremost, it?s a very well established business that have been around for decades. ",Wahid Nawabi,4393726
,,,,
13160,Question-and-Answer,"They have made a very strong name for themselves. They are known for very best-in-class technology. They?ve got some very unique technology and IP related to their design of their systems, number one. Number two, forty plus countries, they do business with already. The business is growing ? has been growing in the past few years. ",Wahid Nawabi,4393726
,,,,
13161,Question-and-Answer,"Obviously, the company is private right now and we cannot get into the details of that until the deal closes, which we expect that to happen sometimes in the spring, early next calendar year. But we believe that?s going to be accretive GAAP-wise on that in two years and it will be non-GAAP EPS accretive at our fiscal year 2022, really depending on when the close actually takes place. ",Wahid Nawabi,4393726
,,,,
13162,Question-and-Answer,"The number one criteria for the close is really the approval of the German government for the acquisition to go through. We have worked it for a while. We are very familiar with the company. We?ve been working with these guys for a significant amount of time. We assess the market. We believe they are very well positioned to compete in both the domestic opportunities, as well as international ones. ",Wahid Nawabi,4393726
,,,,
13163,Question-and-Answer,"And a great example of that is, just recently not more than a few weeks ago, two or three weeks ago, we submitted a joint proposal for a U.S. Air Force robotics RFP which AeroVironment is acting as the prime contractor. ",Wahid Nawabi,4393726
,,,,
13164,Question-and-Answer,"So, we could not announce the details of that at that time due to its disclosure issues, but we believe that long-term, this is a very, very good acquisition for both our short-term as well as long-term strategy and value creation. ",Wahid Nawabi,4393726
,,,,
13165,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. ,Ken Herbert,4393726
,,,,
13166,Question-and-Answer,"You are welcome, Ken. ",Wahid Nawabi,4393726
,,,,
13167,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you, Ken. And before we go on and respond to your question, Wahid, as we said in our first quarter earnings call, a quarter ago, we expect about $42 million of revenue this year from the army LMAMS contract that was announced on April 30 of this year. So, hopefully, that fills in the answer to that question. ",Steven Gitlin,4393726
,,,,
13168,Question-and-Answer,We?ll now turn to Pete Skibitski from Alembic Global for our next questions. Pete? ,Steven Gitlin,4393726
,,,,
13169,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. Thanks guys. Nice quarter. Just to follow-up on Switchblade and this appropriations issue, is it reasonable for us to expect that fiscal 2022 Switchblade revenue for you ? the 300, the LMAMS will decline? Or how should we think about that? ",Pete Skibitski,4393726
,,,,
13170,Question-and-Answer,"Thanks, Pete. This is Wahid. So, in terms of fiscal 2022, we are going to provide guidance on that on our fourth quarter earnings. However, this is not something that we believe is going to affect us in terms of our revenue and our relationship and the adoption of Switchblade 300. As you know, we?ve been very successful over the last decade to continue to grow that business. ",Wahid Nawabi,4393726
,,,,
13171,Question-and-Answer,"We have been the ? by far the almost the sole source provider of this capability to the US Military on a number of competitions, which we have won those hands down across the board in the last several, several years. There is significant amount of dollars already in the budget process from government fiscal year 2018, 2019 and 2020, as I mentioned. ",Wahid Nawabi,4393726
,,,,
13172,Question-and-Answer,"A significant portion of that is still not contracted and awarded to us and we expect to get those awards sometimes this fiscal year or the beginning of next fiscal year depending really on how the government proceeds and the COVID situation continues. So I personally do not consider this to be a major issue. I just wanted to communicate to all of you what we have learned so far and what's out there, so you are aware of it. ",Wahid Nawabi,4393726
,,,,
13173,Question-and-Answer,,Wahid Nawabi,4393726
,,,,
13174,Question-and-Answer,"Additionally, last point I want to make on this. The US Army already has a potential competition planned for the phase beyond this JUONS that we have a three year contract on. So, we are working with our customer to make sure that we compete for that and we believe that we are positioned very well for that. So when that award takes place, sometimes probably next calendar year, then it will be a smooth transition from the existing contract and the revenue stream that we have and the awards that we've received to continue beyond that.",Wahid Nawabi,4393726
,,,,
13175,Question-and-Answer,"So, our position is that a, we've had significant revenue, strong growth, and, b, we believe that there is still significant dollars unawarded yet, which we are expecting to receive that, which will sort of bridge the gap between our fiscal year 2021 and the government fiscal year 2021, which will then get to the next competition and next award hopefully.",Wahid Nawabi,4393726
,,,,
13176,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. Got it. I guess, just one follow-up for me on a different topic. There is some chatter out there I think on the Navy Submarine launch UAV program that there has been a lot of exercises and progress has been made and I think there was an RFI out there. So, can you maybe update us on? Are you expecting maybe in calendar 2021 to see maybe a competition for that mission area as well?",Pete Skibitski ,4393726
,,,,
13177,Question-and-Answer,"Sure. So, the specific Navy Submarine launch UAV that you are referring to is very much geared towards our Blackwing platform and variant of Switchblade. As you know, in the past couple of years, I have been providing updates on our success and our progress with the navy on piloting this and actually doing field trials in the sea with various submarines. ",Wahid Nawabi ,4393726
,,,,
13178,Question-and-Answer,"So we continue to make progress there. We have had a lot of really good success in terms of trials and real demonstrations and field deployments. Obviously, it's a very critical growth opportunity for us. But the adoption rate within this Navy Submarine is quite slow. So, we expect in that Navy Submarine launch RFI that you see that we will be able to compete, we are positioned really well and we continue to make progress on that front with our customer. ",Wahid Nawabi ,4393726
,,,,
13179,Question-and-Answer,"So, expect us to obviously compete on that again and we are very well aware of it and engaged with it and we've already delivered a certain number of units to our customer throughout the last year-and-a-half or two.",Wahid Nawabi ,4393726
,,,,
13180,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you, Pete. Our next question comes from Peter Arment at Baird. Peter?",Steven Gitlin ,4393726
,,,,
13181,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. Good afternoon Wahid, Kevin, Steven. Hey, Wahid, question I guess on the Switchblade 600. You mentioned the February kind of timeframe for a potential decision there. Can you maybe just describe what you are expecting there in terms of a competition?",Peter Arment ,4393726
,,,,
13182,Question-and-Answer,"Sure. So, I think, Peter you're referring to the Marine Corps OPFM, Organic Precision Fire Mounted potential program and competition. As I mentioned in my remarks, we have already received about $5 million worth of funding as part of a selection process last fiscal year. ",Wahid Nawabi ,4393726
,,,,
13183,Question-and-Answer,"And we ? this past quarter of this year we've also received an additional $1 million to keep improving the capability, which involves our Switchblade 600 with our customer being the Marine Corps. We think that we are positioned very well, but there are other competitors that are also competing in this competition. ",Wahid Nawabi ,4393726
,,,,
13184,Question-and-Answer,"However, as you know Switchblade 600s capability is very unique and very, very compelling. We also have a tremendous, I would call it a leg up for sort of advanced progress because of our track record with our original Switchblade in this field. So, the customer intends to have the competition and fly off sometimes in February of this year, which obviously because of COVID it is not guaranteed, but that's what we are ? we expect that to happen as of now. ",Wahid Nawabi ,4393726
,,,,
13185,Question-and-Answer,,Wahid Nawabi ,4393726
,,,,
13186,Question-and-Answer,And once they do that they expect to down-select to the most mature solution and the best solution to go proceed further. There is approximately $20 million-ish or so in the government fiscal year 2021 budget for the OPFM program and it continues after that to become into an initial rate of ? low initial rate of production. ,Wahid Nawabi ,4393726
,,,,
13187,Question-and-Answer,"And then beyond that, the US Marine Corps has publicly stated that they would like to get into a full production eventually as a result of this competition and down-select. So, the short of it is Peter that we believe A, we're positioned really well, B, our progress and our success so far, gives us a unique advantage in my view to be able to compete, just like we've always done in this space. ",Wahid Nawabi ,4393726
,,,,
13188,Question-and-Answer,"And three, it is a long-term program that we are really keeping an eye on that we think it's a good starting point for Switchblade 600 amongst other opportunities and we'll keep you updated as we make progress.",Wahid Nawabi ,4393726
,,,,
13189,Question-and-Answer,"That's really helpful color. Thanks Wahid. Just and - just as a follow-up. Kevin, you mentioned, I am sorry if I missed this. You said that there were some delays tied to COVID on orders. Did you quantify that? Or if you can give us a little color that would be helpful? Thanks.",Peter Arment ,4393726
,,,,
13190,Question-and-Answer,"No, we don't have an exact quantification of that. But we are maintaining our guidance for the year and ? but obviously with COVID restrictions there has been situations where demos and things like this gets delayed.",Kevin McDonnell ,4393726
,,,,
13191,Question-and-Answer,"Just to add to Kevin's point, Peter, as we said on our remarks, we expect that some of these delays during our fourth quarter earnings call, which was the beginning of our fiscal year 2021 and we provided that, and we actually planned for that as part of our objectives and guidance that we provided. Obviously, this COVID-19 pandemic has been beyond belief, more difficult and also it extended further longer. None of it's actually been outside of our scope and prospective and forecast that we expected. ",Wahid Nawabi ,4393726
,,,,
13192,Question-and-Answer,"However, given that the pandemic still continues, we still expect some delays. I am so proud of our team. The job, they have done in terms of addressing both the contracting obstacles and delays that we have been experiencing with customers as well as the supply chain issues that we've experienced with some suppliers, not all, just very select some of them. ",Wahid Nawabi ,4393726
,,,,
13193,Question-and-Answer,"So overall we're making great progress. We are on track, and as you can see from our results that supports it. And then also, for the second half of the year we are positioned well, although we just want to give you all the color as to what the landscape looks like going into the second half of this year. And we'll keep you updated.",Wahid Nawabi ,4393726
,,,,
13194,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you, Peter. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Joe De Nardi at Stifel. Joe?",Steven Gitlin ,4393726
,,,,
13195,Question-and-Answer,Hey. Good afternoon everybody.,Joseph De Nardi ,4393726
,,,,
13196,Question-and-Answer,"Hey, Joe.",Wahid Nawabi ,4393726
,,,,
13197,Question-and-Answer,"Wahid, you mentioned that you are not expecting, I guess, the LMAMS funding issue to impact, I guess revenue for next year. But as it relates to some of the order delays that you are seeing now, should we take that into account as we think about next year's revenue. Is that a potential risk? Are you assuming that that does kind of negatively impact the business next year?",Joseph De Nardi ,4393726
,,,,
13198,Question-and-Answer,"So, Joe, I mean, we are very, very focused on executing our fiscal year 2021 right now. We will provide specific color to fiscal 2022 on our fourth quarter earnings call. I do however underline or emphasize that our three consecutive years of top-line growth and profitability shows the diversification and the resiliency of our portfolio now versus many years ago. ",Wahid Nawabi ,4393726
,,,,
13199,Question-and-Answer,"Not only do we have a diversified customer base, but also in terms of countries, geographies, product-line portfolio and opportunities. We feel very good about our chances of long-term value creation and growth. I believe that there are several factors that we are looking forward to and updating you as we progress in terms of opportunities that we have. ",Wahid Nawabi ,4393726
,,,,
13200,Question-and-Answer,,Wahid Nawabi ,4393726
,,,,
13201,Question-and-Answer,"But I think the long-term picture for us right now as of today looks quite good. And I really like our cars, given what's going on in the world and what our customers? need and what opportunities we've got in front of us irrespective of the LMAMS. I think that that's going to be ? it's just one element of many, many other growth opportunities that we have and even in that growth opportunity we've been growing. ",Wahid Nawabi ,4393726
,,,,
13202,Question-and-Answer,"We've been growing our LMAMS business for several years. There is significant dollars in the pipeline. We are talking to our customers very, very regularly, obviously remotely and we think that we're going to overcome these issues, especially now that the vaccines are becoming available quite soon.",Wahid Nawabi ,4393726
,,,,
13203,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. And then, Wahid, is there any update on kind of international Switchblade opportunities timing and does that?s being a reality for you?",Joseph De Nardi ,4393726
,,,,
13204,Question-and-Answer,"Nothing really has changed materially since last quarter, because we are still engaged with customers. Obviously, this COVID situation has made it difficult engaging with international customers and having them to work with our ? the Department of State, as well as the Pentagon. But we still see potential - multiple countries that are interested, engaged. And as we have more updates we'll let you know. ",Wahid Nawabi ,4393726
,,,,
13205,Question-and-Answer,"It's just a matter of when versus if you ask me still. Nothing materially has changed from that. We'll continue to make progress, but at a slower rate due to COVID.",Wahid Nawabi ,4393726
,,,,
13206,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you for your questions, Joe. [Operator Instructions] We'll now take the next question from Louie DiPalma from William Blair. Louie?",Steven Gitlin ,4393726
,,,,
13207,Question-and-Answer,"Wahid, Kevin, and Steve, good afternoon.",Louie DiPalma ,4393726
,,,,
13208,Question-and-Answer,"Good afternoon, Louie.",Wahid Nawabi ,4393726
,,,,
13209,Question-and-Answer,"Regarding the Switchblade 600 makeup for the Organic Precision Fires Mounted program, I was wondering how strong are AeroVironment's patents for the Switchblades wave-off capability?",Louie DiPalma ,4393726
,,,,
13210,Question-and-Answer,"Very good question and great insight, Louie. Our wave-off is A, one of the most important patents on our Switchblade portfolio, but it's not the only one. We believe that that patent is very critical. It's very defensible. We have multiple patents both in terms of specific narrow technology patents that address the specifics very deep narrow technology area, but also quite broad ones like the wave-off. ",Wahid Nawabi ,4393726
,,,,
13211,Question-and-Answer,"So, we have ? when we make these investments in R&D to develop these capabilities, we always think about how to make sure how we defend that. And we also have a track record of defending our technology and our IP, as you've seen from previous gains that we've had in litigations of similar type of matters.",Wahid Nawabi ,4393726
,,,,
13212,Question-and-Answer,"So, again, I think that our technology is strong, I think our position and our progress so far gives us also an advantage. But we're not relying just on that. We believe that we want to make sure irrespective of technology that our solution is the best solution for our customers when it comes to their selection. And we feel good about it. ",Wahid Nawabi ,4393726
,,,,
13213,Question-and-Answer,"So, when we look forward to the competition as we always do, that's the business that we are very familiar with competing and having a high win rate in our competitions.",Wahid Nawabi ,4393726
,,,,
13214,Question-and-Answer,"Sounds good. And you guys made great progress with the Sunglider and you spoke about the video call and the high-quality resolution. And Kevin, you indicated that HAPSMobile had a write-down associated with its investment in Loon, And I was wondering what are the implications of Google potentially, no longer looking to fund Loon? ",Louie DiPalma ,4393726
,,,,
13215,Question-and-Answer,"And like, is there an opportunity for AeroVironment to potentially acquire like Loon's technology assets in order to have that intellectual property for the telecom that's involved in the radio access layer and provide connectivity? Thanks.",Louie DiPalma ,4393726
,,,,
13216,Question-and-Answer,"So, Louie, this is Wahid. A great question again. In terms of the impairment, it was really just an accounting exercise on our side. It was related to an investment that HAPSMobile made into Loon LLC that based on Alphabet and Loon LLC's own decision and process ? accounting process triggered a devaluation of that investment, which then triggered an impairment in our side, one-time of course and it sort of expedited the impairment losses of our investments into HAPSMobile. ",Wahid Nawabi ,4393726
,,,,
13217,Question-and-Answer,,Wahid Nawabi ,4393726
,,,,
13218,Question-and-Answer,"So it has nothing to do with our business operations, particularly and it has almost it literally happen to do with the HAPSMobile's relationship with us of AeroVironment.",Wahid Nawabi ,4393726
,,,,
13219,Question-and-Answer,"In terms of Loon, that's really a question related to Alphabet and Loon themselves. I am not in a position to have insight into that. Obviously, we are not involved in their business. We feel very good about our relationship in general as they are sort of like a supplier to us on the payload of the HAPSMobile. We flew that payload. We demonstrated the capability. We continue to talk and work together. ",Wahid Nawabi ,4393726
,,,,
13220,Question-and-Answer,"And all of us, both SoftBank and AeroVironment is quite bullish about our beliefs and Sunglider's prospects for success in the long run. We've always believed in that. I think that our track record of success so far substantiates and supports and improves the fact that this is a very viable platform for the connectivity of the global population of human being on this globe. So, we look forward to that.",Wahid Nawabi ,4393726
,,,,
13221,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you, Louie. We'll now turn back to Joe DeNardi from Stifel with follow-up question. Joe?",Steven Gitlin ,4393726
,,,,
13222,Question-and-Answer,"Thanks. Just two for Kevin, I think. Can you give us what's international sales were in the quarter? Just total international including HAPS?",Joseph De Nardi ,4393726
,,,,
13223,Question-and-Answer,"Total international is actually split 50-50. It was just around $46 million, little over $46 million.",Kevin McDonnell ,4393726
,,,,
13224,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. Great. And you talked about kind of lower G&A, I guess, as a result of travel and trade shows. How much of that is structural? I mean, how material could that be on the other side of this? Do you expect it to be for most of it to come back or to be reinvested elsewhere? Thank you.",Joseph De Nardi ,4393726
,,,,
13225,Question-and-Answer,"It's difficult to say when comeback will happen. So, but obviously there would be some reinvestment at that time and we're not really putting the number on it right now.",Kevin McDonnell ,4393726
,,,,
13226,Question-and-Answer,Okay. Thank you.,Joseph De Nardi ,4393726
,,,,
13227,Question-and-Answer,"Thanks for the follow-up question, Joe. Yes, and we appreciate it. And at this point we have no further questions today.

13263,Presentation,Fiscal 2020 is truly a year that none of us will ever forget and we always say here at the company that winning at Oil-Dri is a team game and this year exemplified that to an incredible level and I just want to make sure I thank -- start by thanking and then finish by thanking the Oil-Dri team globally because none of this could have happened without them and it is truly my honor to be leading such a great group of people who share core values and then work every day to create value from sorbent minerals for our investors.,Dan Jaffee,4393708

We clean the plants three times a day, we do a super cleaning on the weekends, and knock on wood, to-date, we have had a few COVID in -- teammates who have had COVID, but to our knowledge, they didn't get it at Oil-Dri, they got it somewhere else and because of our policy of letting people stay home and recover and sequester and so forth quarantine, have not brought it into our facility. So, I just want to thank everybody for keeping Oil-Dri fiscally and physically healthy.",Dan Jaffee,4393708

And it just feels really good to be able to navigate this pandemic and sometimes, they say it's better to be lucky than good and my grandpa Nick used always say, the harder I work, the luckier I get, whichever led to our luck of being essential that -- no one thought about that before and now I don't think anyone will ever forget, again, whether or not the businesses they happen to be in are essential, or the businesses they happen to be investing in, are essential, because you could be the greatest team in the world and the greatest CEO in the world.",Dan Jaffee,4393708

13266,Presentation,"And if you're running a movie-theatre business or a cruise line or something like that, your business is hurting, because nothing -- everything is grounded at this point in time. So, I feel very fortunate that our products have been tied forever to food and to pets and I think we've all seen the trend in pets, and you'll be hearing from Jessica Moskowitz, but our furry four legged friends are always important to us. But in times of stress and pressure, they're even more important to us and with people living at home with their family and kids and so forth, adoptions went through the roof.",Dan Jaffee,4393708

,,,,
13268,Presentation,"As I said, winning at Oil-Dri is a team game and I always like to highlight the new Vice Presidents during the year because an investment in Oil-Dri really is an investment in our people.

,,,,
13269,Presentation,"First is Rachel Bellante, she's our Vice President of Sales for Non-Foods and Rachel received her BA from Wisconsin, Madison. She -- cut her teeth getting great brand experience at Miller Brewing Company, PepsiCo, Dannon, Dr. Pepper my favorite, and Rachel by the way, if you can get me Diet Dr. Pepper Cherry, I'd be forever in your debt. I can't seem to find it anymore, and Snapple in category management and sales and she's also had private label experience with Heartland Food Products and as you well know, we are reason to be our unique positioning in the cat litter category is that we not only sell popularly priced and high performing branded items, but we also partner up with retailers from coast-to-coast to provide their own brand, their private label and so her dual experience makes her uniquely qualified to be our VP of Sales in Nonfoods.",Dan Jaffee,4393708
,,,,
13270,Presentation,,Dan Jaffee,4393708
,,,,
13271,Presentation,"Also, as you know many of you know in the consumer products industry, the days of schmoozing the buyers, and wining and dining them is over, it is now all about data management, it is all about helping them better run their categories so that they can look better and advance their careers.",Dan Jaffee,4393708
,,,,
13272,Presentation,"And so her background in syndicated data management, analysis, and insights with IRI and Nielsen, again, makes her a fact based seller and as we always like to say at Oil-Dri, everyone's entitled to their opinion, but they're not entitled to the facts.

So, Rachel, congratulations and thank you for being our VP of Sales in Non-Foods.",Dan Jaffee,4393708
,,,,
13274,Presentation,"And then over on the other side, as you well know, our other incredible growth opportunity is an Amlan International.

He has had over 20 years' experience in the poultry industry, all with primary breeding companies. He's got global experience the U.S., Europe, Middle East, Africa, and Asia.

,,,,
13276,Presentation,"And Fred is like our seal of approval because he's joined us, we have been able to recruit and onboard just an incredible what I call a dream team. And we've been able to rapidly enhance our skill set in our sales team, thanks to Fred. They initially see us because of Fred and then they get involved with our lab and our science and our data. And that seals them on the fact that we are sitting on a goldmine and it's up to us to figure out how to monetize that and mine that.",Dan Jaffee,4393708
,,,,
13277,Presentation,"And for those of you who saw the news release, I was recently demoted, I am now running the Amlan International business, and very excited to do it. I did this same thing when we invented lightweight cat litter and got it up and off the ground and then was very happy to hand that off into the able hands of Jessica Moskowitz and her team and they're doing such a great job.",Dan Jaffee,4393708
,,,,
13278,Presentation,"As you can tell from the news release, that now I can focus on Amlan and get that up off the ground. And so I'm happy to roll up my sleeves, really understand it in a granular way. And then I will be handing that off when it's ready to someone who is better suited than I am to do the daily blocking and tackling that's necessary.",Dan Jaffee,4393708
,,,,
13279,Presentation,"But right now, a lot of it is about strategy setting, and global positioning and Fred and I are working daily, if not hourly, together to make that happen. So, Fred, thank you for joining Oil-Dri. Like I said, you've hit the ground sprinting, it's really been a pleasure to work with you directly. And I'm glad we're getting the ability to do that.",Dan Jaffee,4393708
,,,,
13280,Presentation,"So, those are our two new Vice Presidents. At this point in time, I would like to turn it over to Susan Kreh, our Chief Financial Officer, and she will walk you through some of our financial highlights.",Dan Jaffee,4393708
,,,,
13281,Presentation,"Thank you, Dan and I know you love to sometimes add color on the finance stuff, so feel free to jump in. It's a privilege to be here today at our first ever virtual annual meeting on behalf of my teammates here at Oil-Dri to share the financial results of our record fiscal year in 2020 as well as our strong first quarter of fiscal 2021.",Susan Kreh,4393708

,,,,
13284,Presentation,"As I proceed through these slides, I will be sharing a look back at the past decade of performance trends as well as focusing on our first quarter results. So, let's start by looking at 10 years of net sales growth, noting the stronger growth in the past two years, driven by our retail and wholesale products group where we are seeing the benefit of our strategic focus on the lightweight and the private label segments of the cat litter market.",Susan Kreh,4393708
,,,,
13285,Presentation,"Looking at the first quarter of fiscal 2021, the $76 million in first quarter net sales represents year-over-year growth of 7% and is driven by 9% growth in our retail and wholesale products group. The company based 4% growth in our business-to-business products group, were strong sales of our agricultural products were partially offset by a year-over-year reduction in net sales of our Amlan products.",Susan Kreh,4393708
,,,,
13286,Presentation,"As Dan mentioned, we have made some key organizational changes in our Amlan business to better position us to serve the animal health market and Dan has refocused the team on the execution of our animal health product strategy.",Susan Kreh,4393708
,,,,
13287,Presentation,"Taking a 10 year look at our tons sold, you can see the downward impact as we very purposefully continue to focus on our mission of creating value through servant minerals. We continue to review our product portfolio to weed out products that no longer achieve our mission of value creation, while developing new products that do create the additional value for our customers.",Susan Kreh,4393708
,,,,
13288,Presentation,"And as we look at net sales per ton, we see the 10-year impact of focusing on creating value because while volume has decreased 16% over the past 10 years, our net sales per ton has increased from $244 to $375 per time, an increase of 54%.",Susan Kreh,4393708
,,,,
13289,Presentation,"And that continued focus led to a net sales per ton of $383 in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, an all-time record for Oil-Dri.",Susan Kreh,4393708
,,,,
13290,Presentation,"Right. And not only are we driving growth in our net sales per time, we are driving even stronger growth at a 10-year compound annual growth rate of 6% in our gross profit per ton, a key profitability metrics that we use to manage the performance of our business.",Susan Kreh,4393708
,,,,
13291,Presentation,"In fact, the $100 gross profit per ton that we achieved in fiscal year 2020 was an all-time high for Oil-Dri, and we continued that momentum into the first quarter of fiscal 2021, delivering gross profit per ton of $102.",Susan Kreh,4393708
,,,,
13292,Presentation,"Next, you can see that our strong gross -- growth in gross profit per ton over the past decade has translated into an even stronger 10 year compound annual growth rate of 8.6% on net income per ton. The $25 of net income per ton is another all-time record for Oil-Dri.",Susan Kreh,4393708
,,,,
13293,Presentation,"Looking at our first quarter performance, gross profit of $20.3 million was $400,000 higher than the same quarter in the prior year. At the same time, our selling, general, and administrative expenses were down by $700,000, due primarily to reduce travel and related expenses and some timing shift and advertising.",Susan Kreh,4393708
,,,,
13294,Presentation,"With our first quarter net income attributable to Oil-Dri of $4 million, which is a 5% increase over the same quarter in the prior year, we generated a strong $20 net income per ton in the quarter.",Susan Kreh,4393708
,,,,
13295,Presentation,"On an earnings per basic common share basis, we came off a record year at $2.70 per share to deliver $0.57 per share in the first quarter of $0.06 per share over the first quarter last year.",Susan Kreh,4393708
,,,,
13296,Presentation,"Next we see the 10-year delivery of dividends per share that are both predictable and growing. The dividends per share during our first quarter rose to $0.26 from $0.25 per share marking as Dan noted earlier, 17 consecutive years of growth and the dividends we paid to our shareholders.",Susan Kreh,4393708
,,,,
13297,Presentation,,Susan Kreh,4393708
,,,,
13298,Presentation,"We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and our solid financial performance enables us to invest on multiple fronts. In addition to the return to our shareholders through dividends, we fund new product development through R&D, we maintain our plants, and we fund cost reduction opportunities in those plants through our CapEx. And in fiscal year 2020, we repurchased 5.5 million of our outstanding shares.",Susan Kreh,4393708
,,,,
13299,Presentation,"From a liquidity standpoint, Oil-Dri is well-positioned with a low level of debt and with a $75 million shell financing arrangement that is already in place that should enable us to have quicker access to funding when the right investment opportunity arises.",Susan Kreh,4393708
,,,,
13300,Presentation,"And speaking of opportunities, with the focus and alignment on our key strategies in cat litter and animal health, and with some key investments that have been made in technology, in organizational capacity, and in leadership, combined with the strong financial performance of our business, we are eager to pursue the right investment opportunities when they become available.",Susan Kreh,4393708
,,,,
13301,Presentation,"And with that summary, it is my pleasure to turn this over to Molly VandenHeuvel, our Chief Operating Officer.",Susan Kreh,4393708
,,,,
13302,Presentation,"Thank you, Susan. Good morning, as Susan as I mentioned I'm Molly VandenHeuvel was the chief operating Chief Operating Officer at oil drive. And I also want to start the discussion with a COVID recap, and impact. Dan did summarize some of this, but I'll get into a little bit more detail.",Molly VandenHeuvel,4393708
,,,,
13303,Presentation,"So, 2020 was a tumultuous year. But it is time like these were the true values and the core of a company become evidence and an Oil-Dri's core is focused on keeping our teammates and our business healthy. And as you heard from Susan, we did we did keep our business very healthy. And I'll talk about how we kept our teammates healthy, and how we kept our business operations running.",Molly VandenHeuvel,4393708
,,,,
13304,Presentation,"So, first of all, being an essential business was a key component. We are essential through many of our applications to name a few. We're part of the food supply chain and oil purification. We supply antibiotic alternatives for animal health. And of course, cat litter is still essential for cat owners more so now that we're all inside at home. ",Molly VandenHeuvel,4393708
,,,,
13305,Presentation,"So, we needed to make sure that we kept our business running while keeping us healthy.",Molly VandenHeuvel,4393708
,,,,
13306,Presentation,"Our teammates have been flat out amazing and we have done what we can to support them. Their physical safety, financial health and emotional well-being have been a top of our priority list.",Molly VandenHeuvel,4393708
,,,,
13307,Presentation,"At the start of a pandemic, we pivoted quickly. Anyone that was not directly needed for production, worked remotely. We had a paradigm here before the pandemic, that many of these roles in the past just could not be effective remotely, such as our very important customer service representative. But we leveraged many of our teammates, and many of our functions and many of our processes to make the adjustment and break that paradigm. And we ensured a rapid and successful transition that has reinforced to us something we say often and which Dan even said earlier, is winning at Oil-Dri is a team game.",Molly VandenHeuvel,4393708
,,,,
13308,Presentation,"So, for our teammates still on the front line, some of the things we have done at the production facilities and our R&D lab to keep our teammates safe, including include deep cleaning processes. So, one, [Indiscernible] you here.",Molly VandenHeuvel,4393708
,,,,
13309,Presentation,"So, one shown in this picture, social distancing requirements, and online video meetings even often when we're at the same location, and of course, mastering, and in most cases, this is 100% of the time, while on property. As you can see, we have some specific Oil-Dri mess that we have made. So these actions have been successful, and we prevented any outbreak or transmission at Oil-Dri.",Molly VandenHeuvel,4393708
,,,,
13310,Presentation,"So, through this transition, we had no major impact customer service. And in some cases, we shipped and produce in record quantities. So, not only has Oil-Dri, survive this pandemic, we worked as a team to thrive and we'll continue to do so.",Molly VandenHeuvel,4393708
,,,,
13311,Presentation,,Molly VandenHeuvel,4393708
,,,,
13312,Presentation,"Okay, so with that, let's talk a little bit about operations of state within this past year. So last year, I reviewed the sales and operations planning process, we were implementing it Oil-Dri. As a reminder, this is a holistic process and how we run the business. It has a regular cadence of meetings each month and tools and processes to better our end-to-end and cross-functional decision-making.",Molly VandenHeuvel,4393708
,,,,
13313,Presentation,"So, it turns out that having this foundation prior to the pandemic has been instrumental in our success this year. So, it has really helped us through the online transition and keeps us organized and focused. And it's a tighter process for communication, data sharing, and overall resolution. So, there's a lot of things that we've implemented in the last year and I want to brag about just a few that we've implemented and I'll talk about as part of the ethanol in process.",Molly VandenHeuvel,4393708
,,,,
13314,Presentation,"So, the first one is the first review meeting is the Portfolio Management Review. So, we spent a lot of time on this, and we now have a very robust, robust list of potential new items for all of our divisions in various project stages. We spent a lot of time redefining the current project success criteria and ideating many new up breakthrough and gross generating product ideas for this list.",Molly VandenHeuvel,4393708
,,,,
13315,Presentation,Project still must meet financial hurdles at each stage and have detailed timelines that are managed to keep us on track. We're setting ourselves up for a healthy future growth with new products solutions that create value from sorbent minerals.,Molly VandenHeuvel,4393708
,,,,
13316,Presentation,"We also have a monthly demand process. It's a consolidated set of demand forecasts that is forward looking in around the 12 to 18 month horizon. And it utilizes the ERP or Enterprise Resource Planning systems data E that we implemented two years ago. So, we're further leveraging that system that was implemented.",Molly VandenHeuvel,4393708
,,,,
13317,Presentation,That gets fed to supply the monthly basis. We've also done a lot of improvements in the supply area. And I'm just going to give you one today is now we actually have what's called a rough cut capacity planning process and tools in place.,Molly VandenHeuvel,4393708
,,,,
13318,Presentation,"So, this lets us lets us look at how much capacity is needed by product platform by month looking out in the 12 to 18 month horizon. This is allowed us to see potential capacity gaps white early and then develop plans to close these gaps. This is one tool that's enabled service level improvements and better utilizes our sometimes expensive cat capacity throughout the year.",Molly VandenHeuvel,4393708
,,,,
13319,Presentation,"So, I also want to talk about results in the operations world. So, last year I shared I focus on our main areas in supply chain operations around the four C's, customer, cost, cash, and capability. So, how did we do in those areas?",Molly VandenHeuvel,4393708
,,,,
13320,Presentation,"So, the first one is customer and as you can see, that's both internal and external and the internal customer is our teammates and --- in the COVID update, we were able to continue to support our teammates through this pandemic.",Molly VandenHeuvel,4393708
,,,,
13321,Presentation,"For our external customers, we have new metrics that are tracking and approving against -- we are tracking improvement against including pay still rates, on time as promised and on time is ordered. And I'm very pleased to say that we saw a step change improvement in all of those measures in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019.",Molly VandenHeuvel,4393708
,,,,
13322,Presentation,"Our focus on quality is also improved with many new metrics and for example, one of them that's been continually improving is our consumer complaints per million units is as is at a record low and still continuing to improve.",Molly VandenHeuvel,4393708
,,,,
13323,Presentation,"The next area is cost. So, how did we do in cost? The simple answer here is that we took out $5 million of costs in the supply chain in 2020, helping to improve gross profit with the bottom-line adjustment. The not simple answer is that took an incredible amount of effort and coordination from the entire team with hundreds of savings projects completed and still hundreds underway. So, really great results in cost helping us overall.",Molly VandenHeuvel,4393708
,,,,
13324,Presentation,,Molly VandenHeuvel,4393708
,,,,
13325,Presentation,"The third is cash. So, our cash and inventory position as a whole did not significantly change, has slightly reduced. But I will say that mix and active inventory has improved considerably. We spent a lot of time right-sizing the working capital that we have, we have focused on inventory by SKU and we've reduced our obsolete inventory, improving both service and costs.",Molly VandenHeuvel,4393708
,,,,
13326,Presentation,"And then last but not least, is capability. So, the supply chain and operations team and Oil-Dri overall has implemented numerous processes to sustain these results and really too many to even start to list. Things like cross functional service meetings and of course, SNOP [ph] as I talked earlier. And this has really built us a strong foundation for continual improvement in the foresees for the foreseeable future.",Molly VandenHeuvel,4393708
,,,,
13327,Presentation,"So, with that, I'd like to hand it off to Jessica Moskowitz who is our VP and General Manager for our Consumer Products Division.",Molly VandenHeuvel,4393708
,,,,
13328,Presentation,"Thank you, Molly. Hello, good morning to everyone. My name is Dr. Moskowitz, and as Molly mentioned, I'm the Vice President and General Manager of the Consumer Products Division.",Jessica Moskowitz,4393708
,,,,
13329,Presentation,"Our consumer division continues to post strong growth in 2021, coming off of an 8% net sales growth in 2020. Net sales were up 12% in Q1 2021 driven primarily by gains in our branded scoop cat litter and private label cat litter businesses.",Jessica Moskowitz,4393708
,,,,
13330,Presentation,"These games reflect continued focus again three key pillars. The first of which is creating value through vertical integration. Our inhibited access to premium lightweight clay mines across the country drives value for wheel drive, but it also drives value for our customer partners and our pet parent consumers. Our vertical integration coupled with our 80%-plus year history and expertise in cat litter, have provided with us with a real meaningful point of difference.",Jessica Moskowitz,4393708
,,,,
13331,Presentation,"Secondly, we continue to invest resources with a focus on continuous improvement and quality, ensuring that we're delighting consumers by offering them great products at a great value.",Jessica Moskowitz,4393708
,,,,
13332,Presentation,"And thirdly, our team, we celebrate and embrace our role as a cat litter that cares in both the long-term -- through our decade's long commitment to giving back to animal causes, but also in the day-to-day decisions and strategies that we set as a business.",Jessica Moskowitz,4393708
,,,,
13333,Presentation,"From a product perspective, on the cat litter side, we've been intensely focused on expanding and growing the lightweight portion of our business. For all of the reasons we've been talking about since we launched lightweight in 2012.",Jessica Moskowitz,4393708
,,,,
13334,Presentation,"Firstly, lightly cat litter addresses a key pain point for cat litter consumer. Cat litter is traditionally a very heavy. Second, our vertical integration in lightweight materials allows us to uniquely offer this premium benefits to consumers at a value.",Jessica Moskowitz,4393708
,,,,
13335,Presentation,"And thirdly, as you'll see on the right slightly not only benefits the consumer, but also the entire supply chain, meaning less weight, less freight, and ultimately less trucks on the road.",Jessica Moskowitz,4393708
,,,,
13336,Presentation,Through that focus on lightweight we continue to see growth across both our private label cat litter those be a new customer acquisition and organic growth as well as in our branded portfolio.,Jessica Moskowitz,4393708
,,,,
13337,Presentation,"On the branded side, we continue to focus on our best performing lightweight products.",Jessica Moskowitz,4393708
,,,,
13338,Presentation,"Thanks to an impressive cross functional team effort, this year we launched two new items under our best performing formula, natural care and bacterial odor control. Both products combine a 25% lighter formula with a 10-day odor control called out by a newly formed max power badge.",Jessica Moskowitz,4393708
,,,,
13339,Presentation,We're using those wins to further fuel our growth and to help continue refine our lightweight strategy into the future. Our lightweight learning has been the impetus behind the addition of a new pillar to our strategies surrounding the launch of a new line of flushable cat litter.,Jessica Moskowitz,4393708
,,,,
13340,Presentation,,Jessica Moskowitz,4393708
,,,,
13341,Presentation,"So, you might ask why we're really focused on flushable. Well, let's go back to the foundation of our success in lightweight. As with lightweight, we're starting with a key consumer pinpoints, handling and disposing of cat litter.",Jessica Moskowitz,4393708
,,,,
13342,Presentation,"We know 30%-plus of consumers are keeping their litter box in their bathroom and with our washable cat litter; consumers can just scoop and flush. But the reality is today most cat litters aren't flushable. So, consumers are scooping putting it in a bag, bagging up the litter, and then throwing it in the garbage.",Jessica Moskowitz,4393708
,,,,
13343,Presentation,"So, for example, one consumer we spoke with was in high rise apartment, he scoops the cat litter, puts it in the bag, walks the clump to the other side of his high rise building, to then use the garbage chute. With more consumers at home close, quarters are feeling closer and consumers recognize now more than ever the value of just scooping and flushing.",Jessica Moskowitz,4393708
,,,,
13344,Presentation,"Second, also like lightweight we have access to minerals that are inherently flushable, meaning that we can offer this premium benefit to consumers at a value. And finally being flushable is better for consumers, but it also means less waste in landfills.",Jessica Moskowitz,4393708
,,,,
13345,Presentation,"Just as it sounds, our flushable formula was specially formulated to just scoop and flush. But consumers don't typically think of cat litter as flushable. And that's because traditional litters develop hard clumps that create blockage in a toilet pipe. You can see that in the image on the left. Our flushable litter shown images on the right is unique in that it clumps in a Super Bowl, but dissolves once it's dispersed into a toilet pipe making it safe to flush.",Jessica Moskowitz,4393708
,,,,
13346,Presentation,"As we mentioned before, the consumers are beginning to see the benefits of flushable litters. Today only about 1.4% of points of distribution are dedicated to flushable products. But 5.6% of buyers are already purchasing flushable products and 8% of consumers are actually looking for and seeking flushable products. This clearly creates not only an opportunity for distribution upside, but also consumer pull through, velocity upside once these products start to gain distribution.",Jessica Moskowitz,4393708
,,,,
13347,Presentation,"Furthermore, while survey show that 80% of consumers are seeking flexibility, we believe that the percentage in places like urban areas is much higher where there's no basement or no garage, and as flexibility becomes available and more marketed, this percentage will only go up. Look at the 30% of consumers that already have litter box in their bathroom and don't even realize that they can flush their cat litter.",Jessica Moskowitz,4393708
,,,,
13348,Presentation,"We plan to support flushable with a highly targeted marketing campaign geared towards those consumers who are already looking for a flushable -- who are looking for festival alternatives. Both the media plans as well as the creative will reflect this focus. Our media plan will be digitally focused with a combination of digital tactics like social media, video sampling, and social influencers.",Jessica Moskowitz,4393708
,,,,
13349,Presentation,"In our creative, we'll focus on how easy flushable cat litter is to use by just scooping and flushing. Consumers can just flush it and forget it.",Jessica Moskowitz,4393708
,,,,
13350,Presentation,Further we'll tie into the insight that many consumers are sharing small -- are sharing spaces sometimes small with their furry friends and being able to flush your cat litter leaves more time for the fun stuff.,Jessica Moskowitz,4393708
,,,,
13351,Presentation,"In closing, I'd like to thank the entire division three team when we talk about growth drivers, I can't think of a more important and critical one than team. We continue to invest to elevate our team and I'm so proud and honored to work with such a dedicated, driven, and down to earth team -- group of teammates that ultimately has helped us become the catalyst [ph] that cares.",Jessica Moskowitz,4393708
,,,,
13352,Presentation,"Thank you. And with that, I'll turn it over to Fred Kao from Amlan International.",Jessica Moskowitz,4393708
,,,,
13353,Presentation,"Thank you, Jessica. And thank you Dan for the introduction earlier. Good morning. I'm Fred Kao. I'm the Vice President of Global Sales for Amlan. I'm here to talk about opportunity for Oil-Dri's unique mineral to improve global food production by sharing our most exciting animal health product, and why it has so much potential to make huge impact in this 3 million -- $3 billion antibiotic world when the trend is going towards no antibiotic ever for many more countries. China as an example started that in July of 2020.",Fred Kao,4393708
,,,,
13354,Presentation,,Fred Kao,4393708
,,,,
13355,Presentation,"On the feature of Build in America aired in September, our CEO, Dan Jaffee emphasizes the importance of our unique mineral to capture the animal health market for years to come. I say Mother Nature puts everything on this earth and we need to survive. And our endless international businesses are nearing the use of mineral technology to reduce and even eliminate antibiotics used to promote growth in animal protein production.",Fred Kao,4393708
,,,,
13356,Presentation,"So, as we set Amlan apart, the key differentiators, not only does Amlan has the best scientists working in our innovation Centre, we have a growing portfolio and we have the most important it factors, which is our mineral technology. We have the mineral technology that is beyond any competitors that we face in the marketplaces, please allow me to elaborate.",Fred Kao,4393708
,,,,
13357,Presentation,"The value of vertical integration, let's take it a little further to know why we have the significant advantages over other similar products in the market by knowing what Oil-Dri present in this very important integrated business of animal health products.",Fred Kao,4393708
,,,,
13358,Presentation,"Number one, our mining reserve, we have hundreds of years of reserve that we do not have to worry about running low on our most precious raw material. Number two, now many companies out there can say they control the raw material that we do, this is such an important factor as we're not dependent, we are independent to ensure product quality as well.",Fred Kao,4393708
,,,,
13359,Presentation,"Number three, we're a mineral company, all we do are evolving around our minerals and with 80 years' experience as a mining company, all we have to do is do what we do best.",Fred Kao,4393708
,,,,
13360,Presentation,"Our activated mineral, not only treating the animals from its challenges, but we can actually prevent it from happening by this rough the bacterial communication. This mode of action is called quorum sensing, which inhibits the bacteria from killing each other and take over the host. Not only does our mineral able to absorb, but they can also absorb by attention of the bacterial molecule to the solid particle or mineral.",Fred Kao,4393708
,,,,
13361,Presentation,"Fourth, it binds the harmful toxins in sweet outside of the body to protect the animals, but we can actually try to prevent it from happening in the first place. And all these things are done with only our activated mineral compared to other more costly products in the market where combined additives are needed just do the same job.",Fred Kao,4393708
,,,,
13362,Presentation,"So, how does it work? A simplified way of saying is our mineral acts as a magnet in the guts of the animal.",Fred Kao,4393708
,,,,
13363,Presentation,"So, mycotoxin, bacterial toxin, and bowel toxin are very common challenges in animal protein production. What we do is to buy our mineral with the feed and feed it to the animals, we are focusing on healthy additives can help with this. Once fed to the animals, it absorb toxins within the dusts, squeeze the bonded toxins to the feces, all the natural advantages.",Fred Kao,4393708
,,,,
13364,Presentation,"When using our product customers enjoy a nice two point FCR which is called feed conversion ratio. There's two points FCR advantages is in a nice size company, processing roughly $5 million per week means an additional profit or the saving of $3.12 million per year. By calculating the total fee saved multiplied by the price of the fee to get a total savings for additional pockets as illustrated in the slide.",Fred Kao,4393708
,,,,
13365,Presentation,"How will we execute the key tactics? So, our growth strategy with Amlan; number one, identify opportunities. Number two; grow the team with strategic placement. Number three, target key players, the right customers or distributors in each country and region. Number four; align marketing initiatives with sales objectives. Number five; accelerate growth with both new and existing product portfolio.",Fred Kao,4393708
,,,,
13366,Presentation,"This is just a slide showing no antibody ever that was shown before. The key account opportunities, while Asia is so important in our growing plan as showing this slide, that is why in the last few weeks, we're able to get positive feedback from our very own variant with a number one and number two animal protein producers in the country of the Philippines received a similar response from the top five protein producers in Thailand as well.",Fred Kao,4393708
,,,,
13367,Presentation,,Fred Kao,4393708
,,,,
13368,Presentation,The soon to be $70 million e-company in China just double our orders in 2021 last month. And our continually will push for no North American market just gave us our newest customer with sizeable orders in the last few weeks to kick off our key account strategy that we set up to do just a few months ago.,Fred Kao,4393708
,,,,
13369,Presentation,"So growing our team, the size of the circle indicates what the percent of the key account opportunities are in the previous slide, with emphasis on getting the right person for our target area, we hired as Dr. Harold Zhou for China, Mr. Heath Vessels for North America division to boost our existing team on the ground was Ms. Margarita Santa for Latin America and Mr. Claire with a APAC. With our plan to hire the regional director of sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa in FY 2022 to complete the sales team as our next phase of expansion in the world.",Fred Kao,4393708
,,,,
13370,Presentation,"The growth strategies, we're hiring, we plan to triple our size of team members in the upcoming years. Plus, we recently acquired nice sales license from different parts of the world to pursue with our B2B sales strategy. With accelerating marketing effort and technical service related services provided to the customers. We position ourselves in the right place to grow rapidly.",Fred Kao,4393708
,,,,
13371,Presentation,"I'll go to market strategy. To ensure that we are not forgetting about the small and medium farmers, we're partnering with three major animal health pharma companies in the world, in various different countries to ensure our products can reach every corner of the animal industry by selling both branded and private-label products. The diagnostic service and biologics and once under development will only strengthen our position as we start push forward with the right sales strategy to our key accounts in the markets.",Fred Kao,4393708
,,,,
13372,Presentation,"The direct sales to key accounts starting FY 2020 Amlan began targeting key accounts, medium, large, poultry and swine integrators in approximately 30 strategic countries with approximately 200 different companies. As explained in the last slide, this is just re-emphasize what was discussed and how important it is to set up our regional business hubs to gain control of the product registration and to support our sales process going forward.",Fred Kao,4393708
,,,,
13373,Presentation,"Innovation, mineral technologies, our core competency, and our competitive advantage by building upon it we?re developing natural feed additives solution for drug free protein production.",Fred Kao,4393708
,,,,
13374,Presentation,"With the last slide here, I'd like to show you how ready we are as we show you our long-term development and adoption process. It can take up to 12 years just to get the product developed and out of the door, including product evaluation, meaning the trials and validation period with different users internationally. And now that one to three years of key account adoption can take the whole product acceptability to a longer than desired period of time. So the good thing is that, we have quite a few products in the pipeline that will release continuously in upcoming years, because we know the importance of keeping something new to meet the animal, the end user and the customer's needs. Thank you very much.",Fred Kao,4393708
,,,,
13375,Presentation,"With that, I'll pass it back to our CEO, Dan Jaffee.",Fred Kao,4393708
,,,,
13376,Presentation,"Fred, thank you and really impressed with your quick grasps of our business and we're going to turn it over to Q&A. We've got a bunch of questions about Amlan and the changes, and you answered a lot of what's out there, but Leslie why don?t you read the questions and then we'll--",Dan Jaffee,4393708
,,,,
13377,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. We have two related questions. I'm going to read them both together. The first one is from Robert Smith, the Centre for Performance Investing. And he asked, where was the direction failure at Amlan? And how will your approach be different? Do you believe you will be able to accomplish substantial progress during the current fiscal year?",A - Leslie Garber,4393708
,,,,
13378,Question-and-Answer,,A - Leslie Garber,4393708
,,,,
13379,Question-and-Answer,"And then the second related question is from Ethan Star, Private Investor. Aside from the pandemic, what are the biggest challenges in growing Amlan sales and why will you succeed where others have not?",A - Leslie Garber,4393708
,,,,
13380,Question-and-Answer,"Great. Thank you. And I'm going to take the 50,000 foot I think you heard a lot from Fred but I'm going to emphasize what he was talking about. I'm going to analogize it to what went on with lightweight cat litter. Before we revolutionized cat litter, cat litter was denominated on a price per pound basis. Those with the lowest price per pound were perceived to be the best value.",Dan Jaffee,4393708
,,,,
13381,Question-and-Answer,"Despite the fact that not a consumer in America or the world used it by pound, they all use it by volume. So what that incentivized was a race to the bottom putting in the most dense materials, you could actually adding rock so that you could get your weight up, your cost down and your price per pound perceived value to be enhanced.",Dan Jaffee,4393708
,,,,
13382,Question-and-Answer,"What we did was turn the entire category on its head to the advantage of the consumer who uses it by volume and the environment, because we were able to cut the carbon footprint by 50%, because we're able to put twice as many units on a truck and cut the number of trucks going into our retailers distribution centers in half.",Dan Jaffee,4393708
,,,,
13383,Question-and-Answer,"So it's been to their advantage to so it's been a win, win, win for everybody except the entrenched players in the category. And it really took a couple of things. It took a contrarian mind. And it took, you know, sort of unilateral control. I mean, it just did I mean, I was in a unique position to make this happen, because I am very much a contrarian.",Dan Jaffee,4393708
,,,,
13384,Question-and-Answer,"And I had control of the company. And so I could take a $35 million bet that we could turn a $2 billion U.S. market, and frankly, a global market on its head, when it's you know, it's pretty daunting. And most people, if they were betting their careers wouldn't do it, because the odds of success are low. And the odds of ending up with a career limiting move are high. But you know, I was in that unique position. And so we did it, and you see the results, and the best is yet to come. I mean, the snowballs continues to grow.",Dan Jaffee,4393708
,,,,
13385,Question-and-Answer,"Well over at Amlan. We were again being letting the competition define the playing field. So they were painting minerals in general, as a negative. And so our prior regime was sort of getting sucked into fighting the battle on the field that the competition wanted to fight. Well, that's not a winning strategy. The key is we want to make them come to our field.",Dan Jaffee,4393708
,,,,
13386,Question-and-Answer,"And what we control is what Fred said, we have quality all the way to the source, nobody can say that you all here from farm to table. Well, we control it from mine, to farm. And so we're the ultimate and controlling our quality. And our unique mineral is the reason why our products are working so well and do something that really nobody else in the globe is doing.",Dan Jaffee,4393708
,,,,
13387,Question-and-Answer,"Antibiotics, by definition, antibiotics is killing the bacteria, the bacteria are not the problem. I'm reading a great book that I highly recommend called the Great Influenza, which covers the Spanish Flu of 1918, because everything that's happening today happen then and only worse. And in the book, they literally talk about how ? and this is Simon Flexner, who is the first head of the Rockefeller Institute in New York, and they talk about how it isn't that, they figured out it isn't the bacteria, that's the problem. It's the toxins they emit.",Dan Jaffee,4393708
,,,,
13388,Question-and-Answer,"And that's exactly what our clay does, it binds the toxins, it's an add and absorbed it. And so when you put it in the animal's gut, it binds the toxins which would be causing the problem, the animal excrete them out, which is, a fancy way of saying poops him out, and the animal thrives. And our dual mode of action is also what Fred talked about is quorum sensing these bacteria don't take over the host, until they recognize that there are enough of these bad actors in the neighborhood to cause a major problem.",Dan Jaffee,4393708
,,,,
13389,Question-and-Answer,,Dan Jaffee,4393708
,,,,
13390,Question-and-Answer,"And so our clay actually inhibits quorum sensing and we have intellectual property around that. And so ? the integrator should be using our clay not only reactively when there's an outbreak, but prophylactically to prevent it in the first place. And so our dual motive action is a unique reason for us to be successful. And Fred also talked about the feed conversion ratio in 2x, we have to monetize it that, creating value from sorbent minerals means creating value for our customers not for oil dry.",Dan Jaffee,4393708
,,,,
13391,Question-and-Answer,"We get the benefit in that value creation, because there has to be enough of it for them, where they're happy to pay us a price where we can make our margin and they still win in the equation. Well, we are doing a much better job now of making sure we communicate the value to the consumer. We communicate why our clay is not just there, but is the central reason for our success.",Dan Jaffee,4393708
,,,,
13392,Question-and-Answer,"And then finally focus, I'm maniacally disciplined and focused and I got involved and immediately it occurred to me, look, yes, there's a $3 billion global opportunity around antibiotic replacement, 40% of that is in poultry. That's a $1.2 billion opportunity for this tiny little less than $300 million company. We've got Fred as a poultry expert. He mentioned Heath and Harold, who are both poultry experts. We have a team of existing poultry experts. And yes, we have swine. And we're not going to walk away from those businesses.",Dan Jaffee,4393708
,,,,
13393,Question-and-Answer,"But clearly, Fred and his team can get sales calls and open doors at every major player around the country. And they understand how our products are used. How the nutritionists and the decision makers are making their decisions in order to decide how to move away from antibiotics, and where do they go to. And so we're going to lean heavily into poultry, just like we're leaning heavily into lightweight, even though the majority of the category is still heavy, we are winning every day in lightweight. And now we're going to be winning heavily in flushability.",Dan Jaffee,4393708
,,,,
13394,Question-and-Answer,"So I hope that answers your question. Really, what I'm bringing to the division, first of all, is rapid decision making, it cuts out a layer. So it's never going to be as good as if I'm hands on involved, because I can make the calls, working with Fred, immediately freeing up resources or working with Molly and the IC, or the supply chain, I'm getting decisions made that, frankly, were stuck in bureaucracy.",Dan Jaffee,4393708
,,,,
13395,Question-and-Answer,"And we're such a little company. It's ironic that we have bureaucracy, but we did have red tape. And I've been able to immediately cut through that just through common sense. And just from decision making power, no great genius on my own. So I feel very, very confident that you're going to see an improvement.",Dan Jaffee,4393708
,,,,
13396,Question-and-Answer,"I think Bob's question was, I won't hit it exactly. I'll paraphrase that. Are you going to show meaningful benefits this year? And the answer is absolutely, yes. But it depends how you define it. I think we're going to be taking a step or two back, before we take about 800 steps forward. We've got to fix some things on our go-to-market strategy. We believe our solutions, because we are basic, we are in a great position to sell the big players direct. The key to that is having the right distribution channels so that we can sell the big players direct.",Dan Jaffee,4393708
,,,,
13397,Question-and-Answer,"And so we got to own our own licenses. We?ve got to do all the product registrations, things like that. So we've got all sorts of work to do, so that we're in a better position to sell the biggest players directly.",Dan Jaffee,4393708
,,,,
13398,Question-and-Answer,"So we will make huge progress during fiscal 2021. While the financial progress, it?s going to come from Jessica and the cat litter business, so that by the time 2020 to 2023, and 2024 rolled around, then the Amlan team will be coming over the hill to help save the day.",Dan Jaffee,4393708
,,,,
13399,Question-and-Answer,"So, we're, again, always thankful that we have such a diverse business that we have everything's doing well, the ag business, and the while the Pro's Choice business has been hurt by COVID. Obviously, our sports turf, the Industrial business is doing well. Our Fluids Purification business is doing well. So fiscal 2021 will be a solid financial year, and it will be a pivotal year for the future of Amlan.",Dan Jaffee,4393708
,,,,
13400,Question-and-Answer,,Dan Jaffee,4393708
,,,,
13401,Question-and-Answer,Great.,Leslie Garber,4393708
,,,,
13402,Question-and-Answer,"So, Leslie, what else do we?ve got?",Dan Jaffee,4393708
,,,,
13403,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. We have next question from John Bair from Ascend Wealth Advisors. And he says congrats on a great year and a difficult time. Are there any new markets in animal health outside of poultry and swine that R&D efforts are either being evaluated or being actively pursued? If so, what might they be? And how far along in the process are you to possibly launch any new products?",Leslie Garber,4393708
,,,,
13404,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah, and I think I hope my competitions, listen, because I'll tell you exactly what we're going to do, so that they can afford all our efforts. John, you know me well. Great question, but I'm not going to answer it. And I think I did sort of answer you that we are really going to be leaning into poultry. So I think being great at one species is better than being average at all species. So we're really leaning into poultry, and we're going to continue to do so.",Dan Jaffee,4393708
,,,,
13405,Question-and-Answer,"So next one, I think we had a question on the supply chain. Let's go there.",Dan Jaffee,4393708
,,,,
13406,Question-and-Answer,We do. Ethan Star has the next question. The $5 million in savings in the supply chain is very impressive. Could you please give some examples of how this was achieved? And what the prospects are for any possible future savings?,Leslie Garber,4393708
,,,,
13407,Question-and-Answer,"Molly, take it away.",Dan Jaffee,4393708
,,,,
13408,Question-and-Answer,"Sure. Yes. So I look at savings in three main buckets, logistics, procurement and manufacturing. And in fiscal 2020 by far the biggest savings were in logistics. Some of that is market driven. But I will say that our VP of Logistics, J.T. Harrison really capitalized on the market last year and wrote some really great contracts for us. But he also led a considerable amount of savings projects that either reduced miles or extra handling or additional costs.",Molly VandenHeuvel,4393708
,,,,
13409,Question-and-Answer,"So for example, we were able to consolidate some of our ancillary warehouses, reduce mileage, handling in some extra costs. And that's the theme that's he's driven last year. And then for logistics this year, as we read our first quarter results, we actually are going to have to offset, some -- made some pretty significant increases in the market. And so we do have some other similar type logistics savings projects where we reduce handling mileage, and improve our utilization across the board.",Molly VandenHeuvel,4393708
,,,,
13410,Question-and-Answer,"For manufacturing, we've really seen some overall process improvements. So Aaron Christiansen, our VP of manufacturing and that team have really put a foundational process in place, optimize the way we run our business, and will continue to do so. And then in fiscal 2021 in the manufacturing area, we actually will be starting up some pretty significant capital that we spent that we'll see the savings for, the first we are looking at alternative energy in our cat facility, solar panels and micro-turbines. It's some pretty great projects. And then we have some automatic and optimization in one of our jug lines, so that will be pretty significant.",Molly VandenHeuvel,4393708
,,,,
13411,Question-and-Answer,"And then the last bucket is in procurement. And that is getting a great focus by our procurement team to really look at opportunities to either renegotiate find different suppliers, or in some cases just redesign the product that are optimized cost. So we've seen great progress both last year too.",Molly VandenHeuvel,4393708
,,,,
13412,Question-and-Answer,"Great. Thank you. Leslie, next question.",Dan Jaffee,4393708
,,,,
13413,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. Next question comes from Ethan Star. I'm pleased with the growth in cat litter sales, what opportunities are there for continued sales growth and the addition of new retail customers?",Leslie Garber,4393708
,,,,
13414,Question-and-Answer,"Great. Jessica, you want to take this one?",Dan Jaffee,4393708
,,,,
13415,Question-and-Answer,"Sure. Hi, Ethan. Thanks for the question. So as we look at our business, we definitely continue to see opportunities for both customer acquisition as well as organic growth. How we look at our business in terms of change and reacting to change? Clearly, consumers are rapidly changing, and we need to make sure that we're adapting. So we're also doing so in a very focused data driven way.",Jessica Moskowitz,4393708
,,,,
13416,Question-and-Answer,,Jessica Moskowitz,4393708
,,,,
13417,Question-and-Answer,"So like we talked about in the presentation, we continue to be keenly focused on lightweight and flushability. And frankly, it's really about looking at what's working and what's not. In today's world, we're very fortunate to have a lot of data and a lot of opportunities to evaluate what's working and what not.",Jessica Moskowitz,4393708
,,,,
13418,Question-and-Answer,"And it sounds simple, but it's really about evaluating what's working and doubling down on that, as well as reacting to consumers and understanding how consumers are changing, and then how we can change in a way that is this really advantageous to us.",Jessica Moskowitz,4393708
,,,,
13419,Question-and-Answer,"And that really benefits to us and where we have a right to win. Looking at marketing, looking at sales, understanding what's working, and then doubling down both from a resource dollars perspective, as well as investing against human resources and team against those key efforts that are really working.",Jessica Moskowitz,4393708
,,,,
13420,Question-and-Answer,"We think in lightweight, there's a lot more runway in terms of growth, both again, through customer acquisition, both on the private label side as well as the branded side.",Jessica Moskowitz,4393708
,,,,
13421,Question-and-Answer,"Great. Great answer. Thank you, Jessica. And we are out of questions. And I want to thank you all and I promise to finish the way I started, which is thanking the Oil-Dri teammates globally for keeping not only ourselves fiscally and physically healthy, but also our investors.",Dan Jaffee,4393708
,,,,
13422,Question-and-Answer,"I know a lot of people rely on our dividend and appreciate our dividend and keeping Oil-Dri. So a lot of companies had to cut their dividend and some cut it just worried that things were going to happen, because they had enough debt and so forth.",Dan Jaffee,4393708
,,,,
13423,Question-and-Answer,"We entered into the pandemic. That's the part that wasn't lucky. We've always run our business very, very fiscally soundly, and we entered into the pandemic in great financial shape. So we didn't panic. We just said, let's see how this plays out. And it played out very well. We saw a surge in cat litter. We saw continued demand in almost all businesses. We're starting to see a weakening in our jet fuel purification business as global miles flown has gone down. And that's not a surprise.",Dan Jaffee,4393708
,,,,
13424,Question-and-Answer,"And we are cautiously optimistic that with the vaccine, which I guess is starting in the U.K. this week, which is exciting, that that starts to roll out globally. That it'll come to the U.S. and we will see pitchers and catchers report sometime in April, maybe they'll push the season back a month. Maybe it'll be May. But then that'll mean that universities and municipalities and park districts will be doing the same. And then our Pro's Choice business will pop back sometime in the late spring, early summer of next year.",Dan Jaffee,4393708
,,,,
13425,Question-and-Answer,"So, thank you for your continued support, and we'll look forward to talking to you after our next quarter.",Dan Jaffee,4393708

13433,Presentation,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2021 First Quarter Conference Call. With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer; Jamere Jackson, Chief Financial Officer-elect; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax.",William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13434,Presentation,"Regarding the first quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozone.com under the Investor Relations link. Please click on quarterly earnings conference calls to see them.",William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13435,Presentation,"Since our last earnings release in late September, much of the world?s intention remains focused on COVID-19, including its current and future implications for communities, businesses and markets. These times remain extraordinary for all of us. From the start of the pandemic through this quarter, our team has had to deal with challenges unlike any we have seen in our company?s history. While at the start of the pandemic our sales dipped, we performed quite well once economic stimulus was implemented in the U.S. and Americans began to drive more.",William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13436,Presentation,"By mid-April, our business began to strengthen and reached an apex last quarter when we reported 21.8% same-store sales, the best same-store sales performance in our company?s rich history. For this quarter, ending in late November, we are proud to report 12.3% same-store sales, another historically strong performance. While last quarter?s sales were more consistent, particularly across the first 12 weeks of the 16-week quarter, this quarter was a bit less so.",William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13437,Presentation,"Considering the meaningful volatility resulting from the pandemic and economic responses, we are sharing our same-store sales cadence for equal-week period of the quarter. We were up 16.5%, then up 11.4%, ending up 8.8% in the last four weeks. The deceleration appears to be related to a combination of normal seasonality and how far away we work from the benefits of economic stimulus. This quarter?s traffic was far more beneficial to same-store sales than ticket growth by quite a wide margin.",William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13438,Presentation,"When we talked in September, we could not have effectively forecasted our growth for this quarter?s same-store sales, albeit we would have been much closer than we would have forecast in Q4 at the beginning of that quarter. We are continuing to learn as we go. In Q1, we felt we would see substantial above-normal growth, but we wouldn?t have thought double-digit same-store sales.",William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13439,Presentation,"Our number one priority continues to be the health, safety and wellbeing of our customers and our AutoZoners. Throughout the pandemic, we have continued to follow the myriad of national, state and local mandates and ordinances and have always kept close tabs of the CDC guidelines. We require mask entering our facilities, perform questionnaires of our team and take many other safeguards like enhanced cleaning protocols, providing mask, hand sanitizers and other PPE to our AutoZoners to ensure safe shopping and work environments.",William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13440,Presentation,"Last quarter, we talked about the pressure our supply chain was experiencing to make sure we were in-stock and replenishing the stores on a timely basis. I?m very happy to say, today, we feel we?ve made significant progress in this area. Our in-stocks are much improved and our supply chain in most of our vendor partners have done an exceptional job reacting to the unprecedented surge in volumes that have now lasted six-plus months. The progress has been significant, but at the end of the quarter, we had only closed about half of the gap from our depths to our normal levels of in-stock.",William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13441,Presentation,"To provide a little more color on the drivers of our sales performance this quarter, I?ll remind you that we were anxious to see what would happen as we got further away from the enhanced unemployment benefits. While the initial stimulus package ended at the end of July, there were still funds being distributed on a state-by-state basis at lower levels this fall.",William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13442,Presentation,,William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13443,Presentation,"As you recall, last quarter we reported finishing the quarter with comp sales running up 16.5%. And you can see we remain strong for this quarter. While our enhanced sales growth declined over the quarter to still historically high levels, we believe the noise around the election, the reemergence of COVID in many areas and the beginnings of seasonal weather patterns hurt food traffic particularly in the last four-week period. While it remains extremely hard to predict sales performance in the near-term, we believe the fundamentals of our business remain quite strong.",William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13444,Presentation,"During the quarter, there were certainly some geographic regions that did better than others as there always are, but all of our regions performed well. And I could not be more proud to say that based on the retail sales for customer segment data we have, we continue to experience historically unprecedented share gains, historically unprecedented share gains. The data shows the industry has been growing in the high-single digits and our sales have been growing at close to double that rate for these categories. While we are thrilled to have these share gains today, our charge is to determine how we maintain them.",William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13445,Presentation,"I am sure many of you would like to know how we are thinking about sales for both the second quarter and the balance of fiscal 2021. I?ll remind you that typically in recessionary environments, our business is remarkably resilient. However, nothing about this global pandemic is typical. There are simply too many remaining unknowns, like will the Federal Government pass the second round of stimulus? And when will the vaccine be distributed? And how effective will it be? What consumer behaviors have changed temporarily? Which ones have changed permanently? All of this creates uncertainty. But our focus on execution remains the same.",William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13446,Presentation,"Beyond our primary objective to ensure the safety of our customers and AutoZoners, our focus is on providing our AutoZoners with the resources they need to provide our customers with an exceptional shopping experience. For the long-term, we?ve remained bullish on the health of our industry. And as the economy enters a deep and protracted recessionary environment, we continue to believe our customers will focus more on maintaining their current vehicles. These time periods have benefited our business in the past, retail in particular, as it has in the last three recessions.",William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13447,Presentation,"Last quarter, I reminded folks the strongest periods we experienced of outsized sales growth over the last three decades have been the early 90s, 2001-2002, 2009, 2010 and 2011, all coming out of recessionary periods. Therefore, we remain optimistic on the industry this upcoming year.",William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13448,Presentation,"Interestingly, after each of these outsized growth periods, they have never been followed by equivalent declines in the years that followed. We believe consumer behaviors changed during these recessionary periods, allowing us to showcase our skills and capabilities to new customers, and we?ve retained many of those customers in the years that followed.",William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13449,Presentation,"I would be remiss if I did not thank our AutoZoners for their exceptional efforts. While I?ll praise our entire organization from our stores to our distribution centers, from the U.S. to Mexico to Brazil at all data and our store support teams, I always owe our thanks to our customers who continue to believe in our capabilities to help them with their automotive needs. I couldn?t be prouder of our team.",William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13450,Presentation,"As usual, I want to especially recognize on behalf of every AutoZoner our store and distribution center AutoZoners. These extraordinary people have been challenged more than they ever could have expected, and they have met every single challenge. Thank you, AutoZoners. You embody everything it means to be an AutoZoner, and you deliver on our cultural and service promises every day.",William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13451,Presentation,,William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13452,Presentation,"Now let?s move into more specifics on performance for the quarter. Our same-store sales were up 12.3% versus last year?s first quarter. Our net income was $442 million, and our EPS was $18.61 a share, 30.1% above last year. Sales were higher than we forecasted at the beginning of the quarter and certainly higher than historic norms. Both our retail and commercial businesses showed strength in the quarter with DIY same-store sales up approximately 13% and commercial total sales growth of approximately 12%.",William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13453,Presentation,"In commercial, we averaged over $58 million in weekly sales, which was over $11,500 in sales per program per week. While average weekly sales per program decelerated from last quarter, that is normal as we change seasons. Moving forward, we expect our commercial business to show continued strength as we execute on our growth initiatives and gain additional share in this space. I?ll remind you that this is a highly fragmented $75 billion market, and we believe our product and service offerings provide us tremendous opportunity to significantly grow sales and market share over time.",William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13454,Presentation,"While there are some geographical differences this quarter, there continue to be interesting trends across our merchandise categories, particularly in the retail business. Our sales floor categories continue to be strong as we believe people have more time and many have more money. Many parts of the economy are still operating at fractions of their normal capacity: movie theaters, vacation resorts, entertainment venues, hotels and the like.",William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13455,Presentation,"Some Americans have the luxury to, ?work-from-home?, eliminating their commute, and unfortunately, while vastly improved from the early days of the pandemic, unemployment is still twice the pre-pandemic rate. This extra time and for some, extra funds, have been repurposed for that project car or doing that enhancement job our customers have been perpetually putting off.",William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13456,Presentation,"At the same time, while our sales have increased in merchandise categories like brakes, rotors and even motor oil, they aren?t growing as fast as the rest of the categories due to last year?s mild winter and lower current miles driven. We believe miles driven will continue to improve and maintenance parts will increase as miles driven go up. And we know from history that the muted brake and rotor growth is also still being impacted by last year?s very mild winter. As for this year?s winter, all indications we have call for a normal winter. Anything, anything normal in this environment will be welcomed.",William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13457,Presentation,"We expect that our sales growth from the pandemic-related surge will moderate over time. However, we will continue to invest in growth initiatives in both our retail and commercial that position us well for the future. In addition, we continue to believe our products and services will be in high demand during more difficult economic times, and this resiliency gives us significant confidence about our prospects.",William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13458,Presentation,"One thing we are certain of is our team continues to perform at an exceptional level. I?m so proud of them across the enterprise. We remain focused on providing everyone with the support, encouragement and resources they need to live up to our pledge of always putting customers first.",William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13459,Presentation,"Now I?d like to again thank our AutoZoners for their extraordinary efforts during these unprecedented times. In particular, I would like to recognize the tremendous contributions of our store and distribution center AutoZoners and their leaders who have been there for our customers, external or internal, every day since the beginning of the pandemic.",William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13460,Presentation,"I ask each of you listening to this call to stop for a moment and imagine yourself in a public environment five-plus days a week for the last nine months, helping customers while at the same time trying to keep yourself, your teammates, your customers and ultimately your own family safe from the virus. Seriously, seriously stop and think about that. That is exactly what our team has done. Our stores haven?t closed. Our distribution centers are operating at breakneck speed. Thanks to these AutoZoners at our stores and distribution centers for all they?ve done.",William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13461,Presentation,,William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13462,Presentation,"In the spring, we implemented something innovative and new for all eligible full and part-time hourly AutoZoners and ultimately for our store managers and DC advisors. We offered them emergency-time off or ETO as we call it. In essence, it amounted to two extra weeks of vacation to give them the flexibility to ensure their safety, deal with childcare issues, care for a sick family member or most importantly, stay home, stay home if they were showing any symptoms. It is worth and it?s worked exceptionally well. Many of them have used this benefit while a significant portion have saved it and will receive meaningful payouts should they choose next month, an $800 to $1,600 or more bonus for most of our hourly AutoZoners.",William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13463,Presentation,"When we rolled this new benefit out, as you would expect, we shared that it was a one-time extraordinary benefit. Who knew then that the pandemic would still be racing at the turn of the calendar year? So two weeks ago, we announced our team that we would allow them to carry over any unused ETO or be paid out in January at their election, that every single AutoZoner who has unused normal vacation would be allowed to carry it over six months past the normal deadline. And most importantly, that we would be extending all eligible full and part-time hourly AutoZoners, store managers and DC advisors in the U.S. with another week of ETO at the beginning of the new calendar year.",William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13464,Presentation,"This is an expense that will be recognized in our second quarter of approximately $50 million. And as I?ve told our AutoZoners on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving when I made the announcement, it?s a large expense, but is more importantly a tremendous investment in them and their safety. I?m exceptionally proud to work with a team of leaders and a Board of Directors who ensure we live consistent with our stated values.",William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13465,Presentation,Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Bill Giles. Bill?,William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13466,Presentation,"Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q1. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic, Mexico and Brazil stores, increased 13.1%. For the trailing four quarters ended, total sales for AutoZone store were $1,960,000. This compares to $1,865,000 in Q1 last year.",William Giles,4393704
,,,,
13467,Presentation,"Now let me give a little more color on sales and our growth initiatives. For the first quarter, our domestic do-it-for-me or DIFM sales increased 11.9% to $695 million, another strong quarter for us. In the quarter, sales to our DIFM customers represented 22% of our total sales and increased approximately $75 million from last year?s Q1. Our weekly sales per program were $11,500, up 9.2% on a per-program basis versus $10,600 per week last year. Not only was $11,500 per week the second highest average ever for us, but we were able to average $58 million in total weekly commercial sales, another near record and a tremendous accomplishment for our teams.",William Giles,4393704
,,,,
13468,Presentation,"As you know, commercial sales is an important growth initiative for us, and we are investing in a disciplined way to create a faster growing business. We now have our commercial program in 85% of our domestic stores. This year, we have opened 36 net new programs, finishing with 5,043 total programs as our sales efficiency per store remains at near-record levels.",William Giles,4393704
,,,,
13469,Presentation,"Let me give a little more color on our success in commercial and the growth playbook as we move forward. This past year, we believe we grew share and remain focused on repeating this for FY2021. Fundamentally, we believe that our share gains are underpinned by the investments we made in improving the quality of our parts offering, many in the Duralast brand, improvements in our parts coverage by model year and a commitment to providing exceptional service. These core focus areas have enabled us to drive double-digit sales growth for the past two quarters and position us well in the marketplace.",William Giles,4393704
,,,,
13470,Presentation,,William Giles,4393704
,,,,
13471,Presentation,"As we move forward, we are focused on several initiatives that we believe will accelerate growth. First, we continue to expand our inventory availability initiatives by adding MegaHub locations. We opened three new MegaHubs this quarter, bringing our total to 47. These stores substantially increase local market availability, and we see a meaningful lift in sales in the markets where they opened.",William Giles,4393704
,,,,
13472,Presentation,"With over 80,000 SKUs or more, we deliver same day and often multiple times per day to stores in MegaHub markets. This means a store can say, yes, we have it significantly more than when they are sourced from a hub that carries 40,000 to 50,000 SKUs.",William Giles,4393704
,,,,
13473,Presentation,"Second, we are improving our service continually by upgrading service levels with our parts professionals and drivers. We are delivering faster, and we are supporting our customers with overall needs better than before. We recently implemented chainwide to the U.S. technology that will significantly improve our delivery times and the accuracy of the commitments that we make to our customers.",William Giles,4393704
,,,,
13474,Presentation,"Third, using our one team approach, we have further integrated our commercial business at our stores where we offer programs. This means that store management and the entire team is focused on driving sales and improving service to our commercial customers.",William Giles,4393704
,,,,
13475,Presentation,"And fourth, we continue to invest in disciplined way in initiatives that make us more competitive in the marketplace and much easier to do business with. We like our growth prospects in commercial and believe our growth initiatives will help us create a faster growing AutoZone.",William Giles,4393704
,,,,
13476,Presentation,"Now Bill gave a lot of color on our DIY business, which I won?t repeat, but I would like to spend a moment on our integrated retail efforts. As COVID?s effect on customers? ability to get out and shop grew, we?ve ramped up our strategy to enhance the customer shopping experience by meeting customers when, where and how they wanted to shop.",William Giles,4393704
,,,,
13477,Presentation,"This past quarter, we continued to see very strong growth in our buy online, pick-up in-store shopping channel. While our other two options, next day delivery and ship-to-home were also up nicely, our buy online, pick-up in-store offering continued its rapid growth. Pick-up in-store grew faster than our ship-to-home option as customers continue to value interaction with our experienced in-store advisors.",William Giles,4393704
,,,,
13478,Presentation,"While our online sales remain less than 5% of our DIY business, the traffic to the website is a tremendous marketing tool for our in-store business. We remain committed to improving the shopping experience online in order to help customers identify what they need and allow them a quicker in and out experience once they come to our stores for pick-up.",William Giles,4393704
,,,,
13479,Presentation,"Our Mexico stores continue to be impacted by the pandemic. In addition to impacting sales, the weakness in the foreign currency exchange rate put additional pressure on our results. The exchange rate finished the quarter at 20.6 to the dollar and was roughly 6% higher than last year?s first quarter rate. As a result of the devaluation, our total U.S. dollar sales were negatively impacted.",William Giles,4393704
,,,,
13480,Presentation,"During the quarter, we did not open any new stores and finished with 621 stores. While the macro environment has been challenging, we believe we are seeing signs of a turnaround with the Mexican economy. We remain committed to our store opening schedule in Mexico for the foreseeable future.",William Giles,4393704
,,,,
13481,Presentation,"Regarding Brazil, we finished with 45 stores. We opened two new stores in the quarter. Like the U.S. and Mexico, Brazil faced challenges with COVID-19, stay-at-home mandates and foreign exchange headwinds. The Brazilian real devalued roughly 30% for Q1 year-over-year. We view the COVID impact to be short-term in nature for our Brazil stores as well. Our commitment to growing the Brazilian business has not wavered.",William Giles,4393704
,,,,
13482,Presentation,,William Giles,4393704
,,,,
13483,Presentation,"Now I?ll pass it off to our CFO-elect and the new member of our team, Jamere Jackson, to take us through additional P&L items and our cash flow and balance sheet highlights. But before I do, I would like to personally welcome Jamere to our team. We are also excited to have him here. He has done a very quick study and we all look forward to his valuable contributions for many years to come. Jamere?",William Giles,4393704
,,,,
13484,Presentation,"Thanks, Bill. And let me first say how delighted I am to join AutoZone at this point in my career and the company?s rich history. It?s been a pleasure working with you, and I?m so grateful for the opportunity to lead the world-class Finance & Store Development teams that you?ve built over the years. I?m also fortunate that you?re running through the tape to use a sports analogy which has enabled me to spend valuable time in our stores and distribution centers and learn the business from the ground up.",Jamere Jackson,4393704
,,,,
13485,Presentation,"Your track record of building shareholder value as CFO of this company has been impressive. Certainly, not many CFOs post the kind of numbers that you put on the board during your tenure. I wish you enjoy all the best as you write the next chapter.",Jamere Jackson,4393704
,,,,
13486,Presentation,"Let me begin on the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was down approximately 62 basis points. I would categorize the drivers in three buckets. About a third of the pressure is the result of one-time markdowns on COVID-related goods such as hand sanitizer, where we saw a significant slowdown in sales velocity as we moved through the quarter.",Jamere Jackson,4393704
,,,,
13487,Presentation,"Another third of the pressure is the result of higher loyalty transactions. As our transaction counts have been up materially the last two quarters, we simply have issued more $20 credits to customers. This has translated into higher sales and profits, but slightly lower margins. Given the share gains we have seen as evidenced by the high single-digit transaction growth that Bill Rhodes mentioned earlier, we are planning for this headwind on gross margins to remain in future quarters.",Jamere Jackson,4393704
,,,,
13488,Presentation,"Now, this is a good outcome for our business as we are driving new customers and retention. The remainder of the deleverage was driven primarily by mix and some pricing investments we are making in select merchandise categories to improve our competitive positioning.",Jamere Jackson,4393704
,,,,
13489,Presentation,"Our industry remains extremely rational when it comes to pricing. All of the investments we are making suggest that we are growing our DIY and DIFM businesses at roughly double the rate of the overall market or better, and we are committed to capturing our fair share and improving our competitive positioning in a disciplined way. Our primary focus will continue to be growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment.",Jamere Jackson,4393704
,,,,
13490,Presentation,"Regarding operating expenses, our team, particularly our store operations and commercial teams, continue to manage our expenses well during these times. Our expenses were up 6% versus last year?s Q1 due to our very strong sales results, and we?re able to leverage operating expenses 222 basis points. Included in this quarter?s expenses were approximately $5.2 million related to emergency-time off and other COVID-related expenses.",Jamere Jackson,4393704
,,,,
13491,Presentation,"We believe there will be long-lasting benefits from our decision to provide emergency-time off for the heroic efforts undertaken by our AutoZoners during the pandemic. This is perhaps one of the most important investments we have made, maybe ever. We will continue to manage SG&A in line with sales volumes.",Jamere Jackson,4393704
,,,,
13492,Presentation,"Moving to EBIT. EBIT for the quarter was $615 million, up 23% versus the prior year. Our EBIT margin was 19.5%, up 160 basis points versus the prior year?s quarter. Interest expense for the quarter was just over $46 million, up 5.6% from Q1 a year ago. The higher expenses related to the $1.25 billion bond issuance and the $750 million 364-day credit facility, both completed in last year?s third quarter. We are planning interest in the same $47 million range for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 versus $44.3 million in last year?s second quarter. The increase in Q2 is driven by the same reasons noted for Q1.",Jamere Jackson,4393704
,,,,
13493,Presentation,,Jamere Jackson,4393704
,,,,
13494,Presentation,"Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was just over $5.5 billion or approximately $228 million above last year?s Q1 ending balance of just under $5.3 million. Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 1.9x EBITDAR. While in any given quarter we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment grade rating and our capital allocation strategy, and long-term share repurchases are an important element of that strategy.",Jamere Jackson,4393704
,,,,
13495,Presentation,"For the quarter, our tax rate was 22.2% versus 23.2% in last year?s first quarter. This quarter?s rate benefited 134 basis points from stock options exercised while last year it benefited 33 basis points. Stock option exercises are unpredictable and as such they will affect our tax rate and ultimately our net income and EPS.",Jamere Jackson,4393704
,,,,
13496,Presentation,"For the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.5% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises. Because we cannot effectively predict this activity, we remain committed to reporting the stock option impact on the tax rate.",Jamere Jackson,4393704
,,,,
13497,Presentation,"Moving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $442 million, up 26.3% versus last year?s first quarter. Our diluted share count of 23.8 million shares was lower by 2.9% from last year?s quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $18.61, up 30.1% over the prior year?s first quarter.",Jamere Jackson,4393704
,,,,
13498,Presentation,"Now I?ll move to cash flow. For the first quarter, we generated $683 million of operating cash flow. This was up approximately $236 million over last year?s Q1. Our operating cash flow results were driven by the exceptionally strong earnings that Bill mentioned earlier and working capital.",Jamere Jackson,4393704
,,,,
13499,Presentation,"Net fixed assets were up 3% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $113 million and reflected the spending to open 41 net new stores this quarter, investments in existing stores, hubs and MegaHubs and information technology investments.",Jamere Jackson,4393704
,,,,
13500,Presentation,"With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 5,924 stores in the U.S., 621 stores in Mexico and 45 in Brazil for a total store count of 6,590. For fiscal year 2021, we expect to get back to our usual cadence of approximately 150 domestic stores and roughly 50 international stores.",Jamere Jackson,4393704
,,,,
13501,Presentation,"Depreciation totaled $89.6 million in the quarter versus last year?s expense of $89.7 million. We repurchased $678 million of AutoZone stock in the quarter versus $450 million last year. At quarter end, we had $117.6 million remaining under our share buyback authorization.",Jamere Jackson,4393704
,,,,
13502,Presentation,"Regarding our balance sheet, our debt was flat with last quarter, and our cash and cash equivalents remain significantly higher than historical levels. We now have over $1.7 billion in cash on the balance sheet, of which $1.5 billion is excess cash. Our liquidity position remains strong as we have both a multiyear and a 364-day credit facility totaling $2.75 billion that remains untapped.",Jamere Jackson,4393704
,,,,
13503,Presentation,"We are also managing our inventory well as our inventory per store growth was up 1.2% versus Q1 last year. Inventory per store was $702,000 versus $694,000 last year and $683,000 last quarter. Total inventory increased 3.7% over the same period last year, driven by new stores and improved product assortment. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable, on a per location basis, was negative $99,000 versus negative $71,000 last year and negative $104,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 114.1% versus last quarter?s Q1 of 110.3%.",Jamere Jackson,4393704
,,,,
13504,Presentation,"Now let me spend a few minutes on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. This past quarter, we restarted our share repurchase program. As we mentioned on our last quarter?s call, we expected to gradually restart our buyback program during the first quarter. We said that we intended to utilize our ongoing free cash flow to buyback stock and based on our view of the future, begin methodically utilizing some of the excess cash we currently have on our balance sheet.",Jamere Jackson,4393704
,,,,
13505,Presentation,,Jamere Jackson,4393704
,,,,
13506,Presentation,"As we said last quarter, if we have concerns about the near-term, we will simply temporarily suspend repurchases again, but we feel comfortable with our ongoing strategy. This past quarter, we spent $678 million on stock repurchases, representing 584,000 shares. We remain confident in our near-term plans and as such expect to systematically reduce the level of cash and cash equivalents on hand through the remainder of this fiscal year and return meaningful and historically unprecedented amounts of cash to shareholders as part of our disciplined capital allocation strategy.",Jamere Jackson,4393704
,,,,
13507,Presentation,"To wrap up, we had a very strong quarter, highlighted by exceptionally strong comp sales which drove a double-digit increase in net income and EPS. We remain confident in our ability to drive long-term shareholder value by, first, investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash and returning excess cash to our shareholders. I?ll remind you that our business remains remarkably resilient through the cycles, and the investments we are making today in our products and services position us well in the near and long-term.",Jamere Jackson,4393704
,,,,
13508,Presentation,"Let me give you just a few initial impressions of my short time here in the CFO chair. This is a tremendous business with an incredibly bright future. We have a world-class leadership team with deep domain expertise and a passion for winning in the marketplace. I have experienced first-hand the dedication and heroic actions of our AutoZoners in the stores and distribution centers, and as a long-time customer, I know that they are the reason why we are delivering exceptional results. And finally, our execution on our growth initiatives give me great confidence in our ability to grow our business and build tremendous value for our shareholders.",Jamere Jackson,4393704
,,,,
13509,Presentation,Now I will turn it back to Bill Rhodes.,Jamere Jackson,4393704
,,,,
13510,Presentation,"Thank you, Jamere and welcome. These continue to be unique and abnormal times, and they require us to look at many things differently to manage our business day-to-day. I?m extraordinarily proud of our team across the Board for their commitment to servicing our customers, the motoring public, but doing so in a very safe manner. While we are learning how to operate effectively in these times, we remain wary of the volatility that can exist, volatility in both the U.S. and our international markets.",William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13511,Presentation,"We are fortunate to have extraordinary people who are committed to servicing our customers and helping them get to work, go see their families or simply get back and forth to school.",William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13512,Presentation,"Our operating theme this year is AutoZone is strong, and I?m honored to say we have come together this year to live this theme like never before. While it?s impossible for us to know what the cadence of the new year sales will be, I want to be crystal clear. We plan conservatively in order to manage our cost structure appropriately. While our domestic retail business continues to do very well, we understand trends will slow in the future. But we believe we have a tremendous ongoing opportunity within our domestic commercial business. While we understand these things, we also feel we are well positioned for continued future share gain opportunities across all the business segments we operate.",William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13513,Presentation,"Our business continues to do very well, but as always we have work to do as we start calendar 2021. First and foremost, our focus will be on keeping our AutoZoners and customers safe, while providing our customers with their automotive needs. Secondly, we must continuously challenge ourselves during these extraordinary times to position our company for even greater future success. We will ultimately be measured by what our future cash flows will look like three to five years from now. Lastly, I continue to be bullish on our industry, and in particular, bullish on AutoZone.",William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13514,Presentation,,William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13515,Presentation,"Before we proceed to Q&A, I want to take the liberty to publicly thank two exceptional leaders. Over 37 years ago, Bill Hackney followed in his father?s footsteps and joined this extraordinary enterprise. And over those 37-plus years, Bill leveraged his knowledge of virtually every part of this business and his deep understanding of our customers to our and our customers? benefit. He will be missed.",William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13516,Presentation,"And almost 15 years ago, Bill Giles traded home goods for auto parts, and boy, weren?t we fortunate. I?ve had the honor to partner with Bill ever since he joined the company. How many CEOs have the privilege to host 59 consecutive earnings release calls with the same world-class CFO. Bill has been a great team member and advisor for our entire organization, and we thank you, Bill.",William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13517,Presentation,"While we will miss both of them, as our Founder?s father J.R. Hyde Jr., often said, ?No individual builds a business, they build an organization, and the organization builds the business?. Both of these AutoZoners for life have embraced that mentality and built tremendous teams. We wish you and your families the best of luck in your next chapter and thank you for all you?ve done for each of us.",William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13518,Presentation,Now I'd like to open up the call for questions.,William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13519,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you. We will now start the Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Bret Jordan with Jefferies. You may go ahead, sir.",Operator,4393704
,,,,
13520,Question-and-Answer,"Hey. Good morning, guys.",Bret Jordan,4393704
,,,,
13521,Question-and-Answer,"Good morning, Bret.",William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13522,Question-and-Answer,"I guess a little more follow-up on the market share gains. It seems like the second quarter you guys have been picking share up. Could you maybe give us some color both on the commercial and DIY side? Where you're seeing the share donors? And I guess the follow-up question would really be on sustainability. If you're picking up share from WDs given your higher in-stocks, do you see that share sustaining in the sense that those customers stay with you as the WD bring inventory backup? I guess, is your position higher on the call list relatively defensible? Thank you.",Bret Jordan,4393704
,,,,
13523,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you for the question Bret. On the commercial side of the business, you've seen the publicly available numbers and I think first of all, we're at the top of the heap in both the retail and commercial businesses with our public peers. So I think we're doing very well there.",William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13524,Question-and-Answer,"Regarding your specific question on WDs, clearly during the worst of times back in Q3, we were in a very different position than some of our smaller competitors. They really shut things down, many of them closed or work reduced hours had less inventory and the like. And I think that that gave us a real opportunity to introduce ourselves and be there for certain customers, that maybe we didn't have the same relationship before.",William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13525,Question-and-Answer,"As we've said many, many times the commercial part of this business certainly is a relationship business. And when you're there for customers, you build up some credibility that you can leverage for a long time. So I think that's the bigger issue rather than them getting back to where their normal operating procedures are, that we were there in people's times of need. And I think that people have long memories about that.",William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13526,Question-and-Answer,"On the retail side of the business, again, I think we're performing at the highest level of any of our public peers. But I also think that there are other parts of the channel, other channels in the retail sector, mass and online that we did particularly well against during this period of time and continue to do so. Again, I think, is it sustainable or not? That's the biggest charge that we have as a management team. We have this opportunity to introduce ourselves to new customers.",William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13527,Question-and-Answer,"And as we said in our prepared remarks, much of our business growth in the retail business is coming from existing customers who are doing more business with us. And I think it's very encouraging that we're ? they're participating with us in different categories than they normally do. And so we feel very good about that.",William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13528,Question-and-Answer,,William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13529,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. On the DIFM, on the commercial side, I guess the WDs historically had strong relationships, but might not have had inventory at a point in time. And I guess as their inventory balance has come back up, I guess my real question is, do you see any shift in the cadence of your share gains? Or the WD is becoming more effective competitors or you really holding all of the share that you picked up in the downturn?",Bret Jordan,4393704
,,,,
13530,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. I wish I had better information to answer that question, Bret. We have very specific information on the sales floor categories in our retail business. We don't have that level of information on the commercial business. So we have to ? like everybody else look pretty much at the topline numbers and try to extrapolate from there, but we feel like we're doing well. I can't tell you how the WDs are doing as a whole.",William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13531,Question-and-Answer,Okay. Great. Thank you.,Bret Jordan,4393704
,,,,
13532,Question-and-Answer,Yes. Thank you.,William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13533,Question-and-Answer,And our next question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead.,Operator,4393704
,,,,
13534,Question-and-Answer,"Hey. Good morning, everyone. And I wish Bill Giles a good send-off again. I think we did it last quarter, but there was a nice message from Bill Rhodes. My first question is on price. I think we've talked about investing in price a little more prominently in the last couple of quarters. Can we talk about the rationale? Any specific areas you're trying to address? Is it price spreads online? Is it DIY, DIFM? And then can you talk big picture around the elasticity of demand? I'm assuming it's not for short-term gains because a lot of the demand is failure base, but how do you think about that?",Simeon Gutman,4393704
,,,,
13535,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. This is Jamere. What I'll say is a couple of things. First of all, we control our own destiny here. In the results, as it relates to our gross margins, are not a result of cost pressures or pricing spirals within the industry. What we're doing is, we're investing in a disciplined way to improve our competitive positioning. We're improving our overall profitability. And in many ways the productivity we're achieving in operating expenses serves as a bill payer for some of the investments that we're making.",Jamere Jackson,4393704
,,,,
13536,Question-and-Answer,"What I'll say about pricing is that we're making decisions on pricing, merchandising and investments based on data and discipline. And these are decisions that are resulting in both share gains and higher overall earnings. So I like the playbook that we have as it relates to the pricing.",Jamere Jackson,4393704
,,,,
13537,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. Thanks for that. Let me ask maybe a follow-up on stock buyback. I think you mentioned, you may exceed, I guess historic levels. And I think the last amount that you purchased was something in the $2 billion category or $2 billion level on a peak basis. So I mean, is there any way are you planning to eclipse that target? And then, would you take up your leverage short-term? Would it have any impact vis--vis the rating agencies? Can you take your leverage up to buyback an outsized amount?",Simeon Gutman,4393704
,,,,
13538,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. So let me say this. I mean, this is perhaps one of the most powerful free cash flow stories really in all of industry. And the business model that we have enables us to invest in a disciplined way in growth and return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders in a very consistent and efficient way. And so what we recognized is that, this model is powerful enough from a cash flow standpoint for us to do that investment in a growth of our business and continue along the journey that we've been, returning meaningful amounts of cash and what the free cash flow that we generate. So we don't see a need today to do anything different in terms of leverage and we also don't see a need today to do anything different in terms of moving off the center line that we have for this disciplined capital allocation strategy.",Jamere Jackson,4393704
,,,,
13539,Question-and-Answer,,Jamere Jackson,4393704
,,,,
13540,Question-and-Answer,Okay. Thanks.,Simeon Gutman,4393704
,,,,
13541,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. You may go ahead.,Operator,4393704
,,,,
13542,Question-and-Answer,"Thanks. Good morning, guys. I think Bill, the trade from home furnishings to AutoZone is definitely the trade of the century coming to this organization from Linens N' Things, so congratulations, again. So my question ? two questions. So first on the do-it-for-me side of the business. Your annual run rate is now 600,000 per program per year. A couple of years ago you were sub 500. And so you look at your peers there in this 800-plus type range. I guess how do you think about getting to that level? Do you think that the service changes, the parts availability changes, the MegaHub strategy and the delivery strategy are sufficient to sort of keep step functioning up to that level of productivity?",Christopher Horvers,4393704
,,,,
13543,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. Chris, thank you for the question. A lot of attention gets focused on our close end competitors and rightfully so, and they both outperform us on a sales per program basis and have for a long time. I'm really pleased with what our team has been able to do to begin closing that gap. But we really don't want to get too focused on our close end competitors. We want to think about the industry as a whole.",William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13544,Question-and-Answer,"As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, it's a $75 billion market. It is incredibly fragmented, much more so fragmented than the retail side of the business. So I want to make sure that we're focused on the entire market, not our close end competitors. If you look back over the history of time, what our team has been able to do has really helped us as you've noted, accelerate our growth in a significant way.",William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13545,Question-and-Answer,"We've vastly improved our inventory assortments in every individual store, particularly as it relates to commercial oriented vehicles. We have this hub and MegaHub strategy, which we are rolling out and continue to outperform, particularly the MegaHubs. Every time we talk about the MegaHubs, we talk about that they have outperformed our expectations.",William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13546,Question-and-Answer,"We now have built this fabulous brand called the Duralast brand, which five to seven years ago, people thought it was an inhibitor to our success. Now, everybody else sees it as a real key part and a leverage point for us in the commercial business. Think about the other national brands at a decade ago were so powerful. Many of them are gone. Those that are still around are less relevant today than they were back then. And now we've also built this really strong salesforce, which we didn't have a decade ago.",William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13547,Question-and-Answer,"We're now supplementing all of that with some technology tools that are some of the largest investments that we've made in technology to make our teams more efficient and improve our delivery and reliability. So we're very bullish on what the future is and frankly, pretty proud of the progress that we've made today.",William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13548,Question-and-Answer,"Got it. And then in terms of the last four weeks of the quarter, you talked about roughly, an 8.8% in the last four weeks. Some of your peers have talked about disruption in the election week. I was just curious you mentioned that if we took out the election week, would it suggest that, maybe the underlying trend rate is better than that 8.8%. And I'll ask just because we should ask any commentary on what you're seeing so far this quarter?",Christopher Horvers,4393704
,,,,
13549,Question-and-Answer,"Perfect. Chris, thanks for getting that normal question in another way. I'll answer it the normal way because we released our earnings so quick in the quarter, so we're two weeks and three days into this quarter. We don't want to talk about what's happening this quarter because we don't want our owners to get focused on two and a half week periods of time. So historically, we have not talked about what's happened inter quarter and we're not going to do that today.",William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13550,Question-and-Answer,,William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13551,Question-and-Answer,"We were very specific in showing you what happened in each four-week period during the quarter. We don't generally give that level of clarity either. I want to remind us coming into Q4 that we told you we were up 16.5% in the last four weeks of last quarter. I told you today that we were up 16.5%, the first four-week period. I think a lot of people thought our sales had gone down materially in September, and that wasn't true.",William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13552,Question-and-Answer,"Regarding that 8.8 that we had in the last four-week period of time. We were very intentional in saying, yes, the election was going on. We also ? in this period of time, sales are driven up and down based upon weather patterns. We get a cold snap, it can be very positive. We get very rainy weather, it can be very negative. So we've given you the cadence. It's very hard for us to talk about and even understand what the next 12 weeks is going to be like, we don't know. These are unprecedented levels. 12.3% same-store sales is the best performance in this company since I?ve joined the company over 26 years ago. It will slow down over time. How fast that happened? I don't know. But I do know we have an incredibly strong business that regardless will continue to outperform over the long-term.",William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13553,Question-and-Answer,Awesome. Thanks very much. And have a great holiday season.,Christopher Horvers,4393704
,,,,
13554,Question-and-Answer,Yes. You too.,William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13555,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS. You may go ahead, sir.",Operator,4393704
,,,,
13556,Question-and-Answer,"Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Bill and Jamere, congratulations and best of luck to you both. Bill Rhodes in your prepared remarks, you pointed out that during the last 30 years or so, the best ? the periods of strongest growth for the industry have been in during times of recession. And subsequently the year after the industry still didn't come negative, do you think this time is different because what's been driving the industry has been some of the discretionary categories rather than the strengths in maintenance and failure, like happened last time. Because there's a perception out there that the DIY business is going to give back a lot of what it's gained this year, when consumers get back out and do what they've been doing previously and because of AutoZone mix of business, it will have ? it'll be the most sensitive to softness in the DIY segment whenever that happened?",Michael Lasser,4393704
,,,,
13557,Question-and-Answer,"Well. Really terrific question, Michael. Yes, this time is different. There's no question about it. I?ve said it ? I?ve just said it. This is the second best quarter since I've been at the company. The best quarter was last quarter. Will we be able to comp 21.8% same-store sales in Q4? I highly doubt it. Will we give some of that back? Absolutely. The question is, will we give it all back? Are we introducing ourselves to new customers? Or introducing existing customers to new categories for us? Are we kind of standing in that gap for customers? I think we are. And I think we're going to build loyalty with our customers over the long-term.",William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13558,Question-and-Answer,"My real question for us is if we had this pandemic, what would our sales have been two years from now? I'm sorry, there's a train outside of the room. If we had this pandemic and you moved forward two years from now and we have 2%, 3%, 4% increase in business that we would have had the pandemic not happen. I think that's a distinct possibility. And if we do, I think we'd be very pleased with that.",William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13559,Question-and-Answer,Got it. The train is a good euphemism for suggesting that. AutoZone is going to keep chugging along. So that's helpful.,Michael Lasser,4393704
,,,,
13560,Question-and-Answer,"You are always good at those kinds of things, Michael. It is light and it's not a train usually.",William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13561,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. The follow-up is on the gross margin. So it's been down two quarters in a row. There's a perception that this might be the beginning of a longer-term trend, particularly if AutoZone chooses to use some of the flexibility it has on the SG&A side to go and reinvest that into the price or other gross margin driving initiatives. So a), is that true? And b), there's a lot of well-documented pressure on labor, so do you lose some of the flexibility? Or do you foresee losing the flexibility if we treat some other factors that are driving your cost of labor, hurt that side of your P&L? Thank you very much.",Michael Lasser,4393704
,,,,
13562,Question-and-Answer,,Michael Lasser,4393704
,,,,
13563,Question-and-Answer,"I would just jump in and say that look from a gross perspective, it's down two quarters in a row, but frankly, a big chunk of this one was one-time. So you've got a little bit of pressure on some of the things that Jamere pointed out, for example, on loyalty. That's a great example of the fact that to follow on what Bill was talking about, is that we're seeing a tremendous amount of traffic and therefore we're seeing a tremendous amount of new and existing customers. Our existing customers are visiting us more and they're building up more loyalty points. That's fantastic.",William Giles,4393704
,,,,
13564,Question-and-Answer,"As we talk about pricing and think about pricing and we're going to be incredibly surgical about it. As Jamere said, it's going to be very data-driven. And at the end of the day, this is about driving gross profit dollars. Ultimately that is what we are most focused on is driving dollars.",William Giles,4393704
,,,,
13565,Question-and-Answer,"And as you can see, we're improving operating margin overall because we're leveraging our fixed cost structure based on the sales that we are generating from all of our activities and pricing is just a small example of one of those activities. But I think overall, the way I think about it is, look, I think our gross margin is very healthy. I think it's completely in our control. We have opportunities to improve and reduce our cost through importing, increasing our importing, lowering our acquisition cost. And as Jamere pointed out, we have an opportunity to be surgical about how we price. And so I think there's a lot of pluses and minuses in gross margin. And right now, they're all working to drive sales and drive profits.",William Giles,4393704
,,,,
13566,Question-and-Answer,"And the only thing I'll add is, you've talked a little bit about operating expenses and wage pressure. You saw this last quarter, our teams did an outstanding job of really driving productivity and we run the productivity play with intensity inside the company, and we've been able to manage our labor costs sort of in line with volume. There will be pockets of wage pressure, as you mentioned in certain regions, but quite frankly, we're committed to investing in our AutoZoners regardless of what happens with the regulatory environment. And quite frankly, that's one of the reasons why we're so good at driving productivity inside of the company. So again, we control our own destiny as it relates to these things and we're going to invest in a disciplined way to move the needle on earnings as a whole.",Jamere Jackson,4393704
,,,,
13567,Question-and-Answer,Understood. Thank you so much and good luck.,Michael Lasser,4393704
,,,,
13568,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you, Michael.",William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13569,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew McClintock with Raymond James. You may go ahead, sir.",Operator,4393704
,,,,
13570,Question-and-Answer,"Hi. Thanks, everyone. And honestly amazing results, so I don't even know what to say. Good job guys. The whole team?",Matthew McClintock,4393704
,,,,
13571,Question-and-Answer,Thank you.,William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13572,Question-and-Answer,"Jamere also welcome. Really happy to have you. I can't wait for you to talk more because honestly, this is a great company. So you made a good choice to be honest with you. So at end of the day, my biggest question here is, end of the day, I'm trying to think about your commercial growth was pretty outstanding this quarter and vehicle miles driven is still negative. And I'm trying to think through this because end of the day, are you trying to say that people now are coming back to work? The professionals that normally would go to mechanics are coming back to work and that's why they're starting to go to mechanics. And that's why the commercial business is good or end of the day, the exit rate of what your commercial business is doing right now. Should be pretty higher than what it is right now, if vehicle miles driven increases. So that's kind of ? anything you can say toward that would be very helpful? How you think about the commercial business and the growth you did this quarter given that honestly, it should get better from here?",Matthew McClintock,4393704
,,,,
13573,Question-and-Answer,,Matthew McClintock,4393704
,,,,
13574,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. Another fantastic question. Thank you. As you look at the commercial business, you're exactly right, that miles driven are down and they?ve been down for a period of time. I would also tell you that another thing that's muting the commercial business is the lack of winter that we had last year. Tire sales were down. Maintenance sales were down, brakes, rotors, which I?ve talked about specifically in the prepared remarks. The other thing that's happening in that sector is the independent part of the sector is performing much better today than the national accounts, if you will. And I think those things will change over time.",William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13575,Question-and-Answer,"As you see, we get back into a normal weather pattern, but again, we're having this opportunity to introduce ourselves, particularly to some of these up and down the street accounts at a different level than we have on the past. I don't believe that people are ?returning to work?. We don't see it yet in a significant miles driven improvement. It improved vastly in the summertime, but then it's kind of been fairly steady over the recent months we've seen. But I?ll remind you that not all miles driven are the same.",William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13576,Question-and-Answer,"So people that are driving to work in some of these urban cores, generally aren't our core customer. Our core customer has not had the luxury just like our AutoZoners that are in the stores and the distribution centers. Our core customer doesn't have the luxury to work from home. They're doing manual labor. They're providing service economy kind of jobs. And so I don't think that our core customers really seen a significant change in their driving behaviors.",William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13577,Question-and-Answer,"So if I could follow-up on that and just ask this question, just because you've made so many investments in the commercial business, and I agree you guys are very good in DIY, right? But because you made so much investment in the commercial business over the years, isn't that a sticky business? And doesn?t that kind of imply that next year? The comparisons aren't that difficult because once somebody goes to you, they kind of don't go back. Is that a fair way to think about this?",Matthew McClintock,4393704
,,,,
13578,Question-and-Answer,"I think it's a very fair way to think about it. And I'll just remind you, when we got serious about the commercial business was 2008. We were doing about $750 million annually at that point in time. In the last 12 years, we've more than tripled the business, getting close to quadruple in the business. And it's been pretty darn sticky along the way. That's certainly our hope. And as we're launching many of these new initiatives that are only going to amplify our service advantage, as we've now shored up our inventory assortments, we?ve built this brand and we've got somebody telling our story and our salesforce, we feel pretty good about the future. Will it be a straight line? No, it never is. But we've had a pretty strong trajectory over the last 12 years of growing that business much faster than the industry has grown.",William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13579,Question-and-Answer,"Look, guys, I really appreciate the color. Thank you very much.",Matthew McClintock,4393704
,,,,
13580,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. Appreciate it.,William Rhodes,4393704
,,,,
13581,Question-and-Answer,"All right. Before we conclude the call, I want to take a moment to reiterate, we believe our industry is strong and our business model is solid. We'll take nothing for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives to shopping with us. We're excited about our growth prospects for the year. We do not take anything for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives. We have an exciting plan that should help us succeed this fiscal year, but I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be successful.",William Rhodes,4393704

13590,Presentation,"Thanks, Chris and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining our year end conference call. It?s amazing how time has flown even in the midst of a global pandemic. And here we are concluding our fiscal year and at the start of another heating season.",Jeff Woosnam,4393701
,,,,
13591,Presentation,"I am pleased to say that in the face of many economic uncertainties, Star Group finished fiscal 2020 with strong performance and is well positioned for the future. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA rose 37% to $130.3 million, reflecting $46.3 million in lower operating expenses in our base business, higher heating oil and propane margins, and increased service and equipment installation profitability. We believe these results in the middle of the healthcare crisis and nationwide recession clearly demonstrate the value of our products and services as well of course as the dedication of our high caliber team of employees. I appreciate everything that?s going into Star?s performance this year, which includes a significant reduction in net customer attrition as compared to fiscal 2019?s higher levels.",Jeff Woosnam,4393701
,,,,
13592,Presentation,"Although the first two months of fiscal 2021 have proven to be challenging, particularly as it relates to new customer additions, we remain confident in our strategy of reducing overhead costs, focusing on increased operating efficiencies, and reinvesting in areas that directly improve the customer experience and will continue to lead to improved long-term results. We have also taken some strategic actions to better position the company for future growth. Most notably, as part of our ongoing efforts to evaluate our initiatives and direct resources and capital, we have recently sold our propane operations in the Carolinas, Tennessee, and Georgia. As you may be aware, beginning around 2011, we began expanding our propane business in the southeast through several small acquisitions and then attempted to accelerate our growth by opening a number of small startup locations in adjacent markets.",Jeff Woosnam,4393701

13593,Presentation,,Jeff Woosnam,4393701
,,,,
13594,Presentation,"Unfortunately, we were not successful in building the critical customer mass and related volume required in order to get these operations to a desired level of profitability. We felt it was best to divest ourselves of the associated assets and redirect our capital, time, and attention to areas that produce greater profitability and better, more consistent returns. Our long-term goal of expanding our heating oil and propane business both organically and through acquisitions remains unchanged. With everything we have done to improve service levels and streamline the business, I feel confident the company is prepared and can react appropriately to any new challenges as we begin fiscal 2021.",Jeff Woosnam,4393701

13595,Presentation,"With that, I will turn the call over to Rich to provide additional comments on the quarter and year end results. Rich?",Jeff Woosnam,4393701
,,,,
13596,Presentation,"Thanks, Jeff and good morning everyone. For the fiscal 2020 fourth quarter, our home heating oil and propane volume decreased by 3 million gallons or 13% to 19 million gallons due to summertime staffing levels, the timing of certain non-winter deliveries, net customer attrition, and other factors. The volume of our other petroleum products sold decreased by 5 million gallons or 10% to 40 million gallons due to COVID-19?s impact on economic activity. Our product gross profit declined by $3 million or 8% to $34 million as the decrease in volumes sold was slightly offset by higher home heating oil and propane per gallon margins.",Rich Ambury,4393701
,,,,
13597,Presentation,"Delivery and branch expenses decreased by $5 million or 6% to $68 million, largely due to lower insurance and bad debt expense. Our net loss declined by $4 million in the fourth quarter to $30 million due to a decrease in the company?s adjusted EBITDA loss of $1.6 million and a $5 million favorable change in the fair value of derivative instruments. The positive impact from these factors was largely offset by a non-cash charge of $6 million relating to the sale of non-core assets.",Rich Ambury,4393701
,,,,
13598,Presentation,"For the quarter, our adjusted EBITDA loss decreased by $1.6 million or 5% to $27 million due to an increase in home heating oil and propane margins, an improvement in net service installation profitability and lower operating expense partially offset by the impact of the lower volumes sold. For the 2020 fiscal year, our home heating oil and propane volume decreased by 32 million gallons or 9% to 314 million gallons as the additional volumes sold from acquisitions was more than offset by warmer temperatures, net customer attrition, and other factors. Temperatures for fiscal 2020 were 6% warmer than last year and 10% warmer than normal. The volume of other petroleum products sold also decreased by 16 million gallons or 9% to 152 million gallons as the additional volume provided by acquisitions of 9 million gallons was more than offset by a decline in motor fuel sales due again to COVID-19.",Rich Ambury,4393701
,,,,
13599,Presentation,"Our product gross profit decreased by $20 million, or 4% to $447 million as the decline in volumes sold more than offset an increase in per gallon margins. Delivery and branch expense declined by $46 million as the additional costs from acquisitions of $10 million were more than offset by a $55 million or 15% decrease in expenses within the base business. The decline in the base business was attributable to $11 million or 10% reduction in direct delivery costs due to lower volumes, lower insurance expense of approximately $10 million, $6 million of lower bad debt and credit card processing fees, a $4 million decrease in expenses related to the discontinued concierge program, lower medical costs of $4 million, and other reductions in operating expenses totaling $9 million or 2.5%.",Rich Ambury,4393701

13600,Presentation,"Going forward, investors should expect that certain costs will increase if volumes and/or product costs rise. Expenses such as delivery expense, insurance, bad debt expense, and credit card processing fees will most likely increase with an increase in volume and/or cost of product.",Rich Ambury,4393701
,,,,
13601,Presentation,,Rich Ambury,4393701
,,,,
13602,Presentation,"Operating expenses were also reduced by $12 million due to the impact of our weather hedging program. In fiscal 2019, we recorded a $2 million charge versus a benefit of $10 million in fiscal 2020. Warmer temperatures during the winter hedge period from November through March resulted in a $10 million payment in fiscal 2020. However, we experienced colder temperatures in our third fiscal quarter, which positively impacted volumes. If the additional degree days in the third fiscal quarter had occurred during the winter hedge period, our hedge -- we would have received only 10 ? excuse me, we received only $2 million under the weather hedge.",Rich Ambury,4393701
,,,,
13603,Presentation,"In addition, our general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2020 decreased by $3 million year-over-year, primarily to the lower legal and professional expenses. Our net income increased $38 million to $56 million due primarily to a $35 million increase in adjusted EBITDA and a favorable change in the fair value of derivative instruments of $22 million partially offset by a $30 million increase in income tax expense. Full year adjusted EBITDA increased by $35 million to $130 million.",Rich Ambury,4393701
,,,,
13604,Presentation,"Acquisitions provided $9 million of adjusted EBITDA, while adjusted EBITDA on the base business increased by $26 million. In the base business, the negative impact of COVID-19 on motor fuels and lower home heating oil volumes sold due to warmer temperatures were more than offset by higher home heating oil and propane margins, lower operating expenses in the base business of $46 million, a favorable change in the amount collected under the weather hedge program of $12 million, and an improvement in net service and installation profitability of $5 million.",Rich Ambury,4393701
,,,,
13605,Presentation,"And with that, I would like to turn the call back over to Jeff.",Rich Ambury,4393701
,,,,
13606,Presentation,"Thanks, Rich. At this time, we are pleased to address any questions you may have. Operator, please open the phone lines for questions.",Jeff Woosnam,4393701
,,,,
13607,Question-and-Answer,[Operator Instructions] First question comes from Michael Prouting of 10K Capital. ,Operator,4393701

13608,Question-and-Answer,Please go ahead.,Operator,4393701
,,,,
13609,Question-and-Answer,"Hey, good morning, guys and congratulations on some fantastic execution.",Michael Prouting,4393701
,,,,
13610,Question-and-Answer,"Thanks, Michael.",Jeff Woosnam,4393701
,,,,
13611,Question-and-Answer,"Hey, I was trying to give other people a chance to ask questions and I will try not to monopolize the call. A few questions. Firstly, on the customer churn, it looks like you are making terrific progress there. Just to what extent do you think that is sustainable?",Michael Prouting,4393701
,,,,
13612,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, I think Michael, we have done a number of things in the last 18 months to really try to put ourselves in a better competitive position and then the same time reinvest in areas that improve the customer experience, and you have heard me talk about that on this call for some time now, and that has certainly resulted in less customer churn. We are hopeful that will continue. We will have to see. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we have observed some sluggish new customer gains in the first quarter. The first quarter is typically a quarter in which we expect to -- we target net growth. It is the only quarter in which we do so or plan for. So, our gains have been a bit sluggish as a result of a number of things. And primarily, likely weather was off in October and November, combined over 20%. So, that will have an impact on that, but I am also pleased to see in those first 2 months of the year that our losses are reduced compared to historical levels. So, short answer is we are optimistic, but we are going to have to see how everything plays out in the future.",Jeff Woosnam,4393701
,,,,
13613,Question-and-Answer,"Okay, fair enough. So then net-net, would you still expect to be in a customer gain situation in the first quarter?",Michael Prouting,4393701
,,,,
13614,Question-and-Answer,It?s difficult to answer because we don?t have ?obviously we still have a month left. So?,Jeff Woosnam,4393701
,,,,
13615,Question-and-Answer,,Jeff Woosnam,4393701
,,,,
13616,Question-and-Answer,Right.,Michael Prouting,4393701
,,,,
13617,Question-and-Answer,A difficult thing to say right now.,Jeff Woosnam,4393701
,,,,
13618,Question-and-Answer,"Okay, fair enough. But it sounds like it?s going to be close enough that at least you are not expecting material losses for the December quarter.",Michael Prouting,4393701
,,,,
13619,Question-and-Answer,We will have to see.,Jeff Woosnam,4393701
,,,,
13620,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. Okay, fair enough. And then so given the warmer weather you are seeing, would you expect to be occurring on the weather hedge in the December quarter if things continue as they seem to be?",Michael Prouting,4393701
,,,,
13621,Question-and-Answer,"Well, with regard to the weather hedge, it does cover the period of November through March. So, there is a lot of the heating season, lot of the heating season yet to go. As of today, we are probably in the money a little bit on one of the weather hedges, we do have two, but we will have to see really to where we set it up at the end of March to see whether we will actually collect it.",Rich Ambury,4393701
,,,,
13622,Question-and-Answer,"Okay, fair enough. And then the last question I had was in terms of priorities as far as cash flow is concerned, so obviously, fiscal ?20 was just a fantastic year for cash flow, and to some extent obviously, you benefited from lower working capital requirements. So, it?s interesting, Jeff, by the way to see the divestiture early this quarter. And I think that?s very, very impressive to see the focus on profitability and return on capital invested. So, kind of putting all that together, I am noticing that the pace of acquisitions has slowed down quite a bit. So, in terms of capital priorities, just from a sort of big picture perspective, I am wondering how you are looking at that like, are you expecting an increase in pace of acquisitions in the current fiscal year? And then on the share buyback, obviously, you were successful in picking up some shares from one of your institutions in the current quarter. But I am just wondering, given the amount of shares you have bought back, we seem to be seeing a decline in share volume. And so, I am wondering to what extent it might be necessary to go back to your broker and adjust the formula as far as the stock buyback is concerned? And I will wrap it up with those questions.",Michael Prouting,4393701
,,,,
13623,Question-and-Answer,"Well, with regard to the share buyback, and I said this a few times, it?s a program and we don?t call a broker and say, hey, you got to do this, you have to do that. We are limited to the number of shares that we can buy based on the average, I guess, I think it?s the last 60 trading days, and we put in certain hurdles during the course of the year as to where we will buy shares back. And we are in this 6-month quiet period that we can only adjust this when we are in an open window, and we are in a 6-month quiet period. So, I can?t change very much on this program that we are buying the units back from.",Jeff Woosnam,4393701
,,,,
13624,Question-and-Answer,"And Michael, in terms of acquisitions, clearly we saw a reduction in activity, particularly in the second and third quarter of this year, and I think that?s to some degree understandable given the circumstances with the pandemic. We are and continue to evaluate opportunities that are in front of us, and we are hopeful that we can move those things along, but time will tell.",Rich Ambury,4393701
,,,,
13625,Question-and-Answer,"Okay, great. And Rich, just a quick follow-up question on the formula for the buyback, what is it that creates the 6-month quiet period around the buyback, I wasn?t aware of that?",Michael Prouting,4393701
,,,,
13626,Question-and-Answer,"Sure. We can really only change the number of shares that we can buy back and the price that we can buyback during a quiet period, and which is usually it?s basically the 3 days after we file till the beginning of the next month in the next fiscal quarter. But the way that we filed our 10-K, our 10-K we are filing in December and we are already in the next fiscal quarter, if you will the first quarter of fiscal 2020. So, we can?t make any changes for 6 months. Now, when we file the next 10-Q, which would probably be somewhere in the first week of December, I am sorry, first week of February 2021 and get my date straight, then we can make changes.",Rich Ambury,4393701
,,,,
13627,Question-and-Answer,,Rich Ambury,4393701
,,,,
13628,Question-and-Answer,"Okay, fair enough. That makes sense. Thanks for addressing my questions.",Michael Prouting,4393701

,,,,
13641,Presentation,"Good morning, and welcome to Conn's third quarter fiscal year 2021 earnings conference call. I'll begin the call with a strategic overview, and Lee will provide additional details on the quarter before turning the call over to George, who will complete our prepared remarks with additional comments on the financial results. The economic environment remains extremely fluid as the pandemic continues to impact many communities across the country.",Norm Miller,4393694
,,,,
13642,Presentation,"We believe our conservative operating approach has allowed the company to successfully navigate current market conditions, while also positioning the business to capitalize on our long-term growth opportunities. Our home-related product strategy and multiple financing options continue to drive strong growth of cash and third-party credit sales, which increased 32.7% year-over-year during the third quarter. Overall, same store sales continue to be impacted by the underwriting changes we implemented beginning in March 2020 in response to the COVID-19 crisis. We believe underwriting changes combined with industry wide inventory shortages in certain product categories reduced year-over-year same store sales by approximately 20% in the third quarter. Despite these impacts, I am encouraged by the sequential improvement in same store sales.",Norm Miller,4393694
,,,,
13643,Presentation,"Third quarter credit performance reflects the quick and prudent adjustments we made earlier this year to mitigate the potential impacts on our business of high unemployment and economic uncertainty. As a result, our credit segment is benefiting from newer, higher-quality originations, and strong cash collections. Since the beginning of our fiscal year, our balance sheet has strengthened significantly as a result of the reduction in the portfolio balance due to the stronger rate of cash collections and higher cash and third-party sales. In fact, we ended the third quarter with the lowest level of net debt as a percent of the portfolio balance in over six fiscal years. We also successfully closed an ABS transaction in October 2020, our first since the onset of the pandemic. We believe the progress we made during the quarter provides us with significant flexibility to support our business through the COVID-19 crisis.",Norm Miller,4393694
,,,,
13644,Presentation,,Norm Miller,4393694
,,,,
13645,Presentation,"During the third quarter, we also continued to invest in our long-term growth initiatives, which include expanding the capabilities of our e-commerce and omnichannel platforms, enhancing our credit platform to extend credit to more customers, while achieving 1,000 basis points of credit spread, and capturing more declined applications for Conn?s credit through third party lease-to-own solutions. These actions will not only help our business through the COVID-19 pandemic but will also expand our long-term growth opportunities. In addition, we continue to pursue our geographic expansion strategy and open new showrooms in targeted markets. On November 6, we opened our first Florida showroom in Pensacola, and we are excited by the potential the Florida market represents. We plan to open a majority of our new showrooms next fiscal year in Florida to leverage our Lakeland distribution center that is scheduled to open in January 2021.",Norm Miller,4393694
,,,,
13646,Presentation,"As you can see, we continue to focus on successfully navigating the COVID-19 crisis while investing in our business to support future growth opportunities. I want to personally thank all of our associates for their continued dedication during this challenging period. On behalf of everyone at Conn's, we remain committed to helping our customers and communities in this time of need. So with this overview, let me turn the call over to Lee, who will provide more details on our third quarter operating results.",Norm Miller,4393694
,,,,
13647,Presentation,"Thanks Norm. I'll start my prepared remarks today looking at our credit operation in more detail. Overall, our credit business reflects the successful execution of the prudent credit strategies we implemented in mid March to successfully navigate the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis, while supporting our retail sales with our multiple third-party credit options. The strength of cash repayments on outstanding loans within our portfolio is encouraging and continues to exceed the seasonal trends we typically experience. In fact, the third quarter payment rate increased 16.3% year-over-year and represented the best third quarter cash payment rate in over 10 fiscal years. We believe the strong internal collection efforts and lower consumer spending are having positive impacts on cash collections within our portfolio.",Lee Wright,4393694
,,,,
13648,Presentation,"As we've stated on our last conference call, we've revised certain of our reaged programs in June to be more restrictive and improved the balance of reaged accounts within our portfolio. As a result, the dollar balance of the carrying value of reaged accounts on October 31, 2020, has declined $75.7 million or 17.9% year-over-year and is down by $45.5 million or 11.6% from July 31, 2020. In addition, the dollar balance of 60-plus day delinquencies has declined from the prior fiscal year period. It will take time for overall credit trends to normalize given the severe economic challenges COVID-19 pandemic has caused and the prudent credit strategies we've put in place. However, we expect favorable underlying performance within our portfolio to continue to lead to sequentially lower charge offs for the remainder of this fiscal year.",Lee Wright,4393694
,,,,
13649,Presentation,"In addition, accounts originated after March?s underwriting changes have benefited from higher FICO scores and a higher mix of existing customers. We also continue to see a larger population of higher quality applicants as other prime and near prime lenders have tightened their underwriting standards. As we continue to successfully navigate this challenging and uncertain economic period, we are encouraged by the improving credit trends we are experiencing. And on October 31, 2020, our credit spread was 6.4%, representing a 420-basis-point improvement from July 31, 2020. We also continue to expand the capabilities and enhance the infrastructure of our credit segment. TJ joined Conn's in July as the company's Chief Credit Officer and has over 20 years of leadership experience at various prime and near prime consumer finance companies. TJ is quickly contributing to our success, and several credit initiatives are under way to identify opportunities to increase retail sales, while maintaining credit risk.",Lee Wright,4393694
,,,,
13650,Presentation,,Lee Wright,4393694
,,,,
13651,Presentation,"Capturing more retail sales through our third-party lease to own solutions remains an important priority for our team and represents a significant opportunity for Conn's and our third-party providers. We have a strong belief that lease-to-own sales should be at least 10% of our total retail sales compared to 7.2% in the most recent quarter. This is especially true now that we are deploying more applications as a result of our tighter underwriting standards. We're working with both our existing partner and testing other lease-to-own providers to achieve this goal, and I look forward to updating investors on our success in the coming quarters. Overall, we believe our third quarter results highlight the resiliency and flexibility of our unique credit and retail business model and the ability to de-risk our credit business while still supporting retail demand through our diverse credit options.",Lee Wright,4393694
,,,,
13652,Presentation,"So looking at our retail segment performance in more detail. Total retail sales declined 7.3% while same store sales declined 10.9% for the third quarter compared to the prior year period, primarily due to the underwriting adjustments we began implementing in mid-March in response to the COVID-19 crisis, and to a lesser extent limited product availability. We believe these headline numbers do not reflect the positive underlying trends that are occurring within our retail segment, which include strong year-over-year growth in cash and third party sales, sequential improvements in monthly same store sales throughout the third quarter and 1.2% year-over-year increase in third quarter same store transactions. These favorable trends have occurred despite the continued impact on retail sales of tighter underwriting, which we believe combined with industry wide inventory shortages reduced year-over-year same store sales by an estimated 20% during the third quarter. We are pleased to see the November same store sales came in better than the third quarter results despite the nationwide COVID-19 resurgence and the continued impacts of tighter underwriting.",Lee Wright,4393694
,,,,
13653,Presentation,"Looking at our product categories in more detail. Total appliance sales during the quarter increased 10.5%, which represents 210 basis point increase from the growth rate in the second quarter. We are also starting to experience improving trends within our furniture and mattress category as total sales of furniture and mattress increased 2.2% sequentially. Conversely, our consumer electronics category remains challenged and continues to experience significant TV price deflation. Industry wide supply chain challenges continue throughout the third quarter across most of our categories. Inventory availability suffered as a result of COVID-19 related impacts on category production, as well as transportation delays, especially for imports. We expect inventory constraints to continue throughout the holiday season with product availability improving in the first quarter of our upcoming fiscal year.",Lee Wright,4393694
,,,,
13654,Presentation,"Turning to our retail growth initiatives. We are constantly testing new ways to leverage our unique in house financing and better serve our core customers. Flooring and fitness are two product groups where we believe our core customer is underserved. After successful tests of both product groups within select markets, home fitness equipment now for sale in all of our showrooms and flooring is now sold in more than half of our showrooms. We plan to continue to expand and refine our product strategies to offer more home related products that resonate with our core customers. Last year's launch of our new e-commerce platform and upgraded website continues to support e-commerce growth and third quarter sales through this channel increased nearly 61% compared to the prior fiscal year period. E-commerce represents only 1.9% of trailing 12 months sales and we believe that we have a substantial opportunity to increase sales through this channel. As a result, we've increased investments in our e-commerce efforts and expect to accelerate these initiatives over the coming year, which we expect will impact our total SG&A spend.",Lee Wright,4393694
,,,,
13655,Presentation,,Lee Wright,4393694
,,,,
13656,Presentation,"To assist in offsetting higher e-commerce investments, we continue to focus on driving cost savings and improving efficiencies across our organization, and we have successfully lowered operating expenses across several categories since mid-March. Compared to the prior fiscal year period, retail SG&A expenses have declined $13.9 million year-to-date despite an approximately 4.5% year-over-year increase in retail square footage. We opened to additional showrooms during the third quarter and have opened one new showroom in the fourth quarter, bringing the total number of new stores opened today in the fiscal year to seven. As of today, we operate a total of 144 showrooms across 15 states and have plans to open eight to 10 new showrooms next fiscal year. We continue to believe that as an omni-channel retail that we have opportunities to grow both our brick and mortar and online business simultaneously.",Lee Wright,4393694
,,,,
13657,Presentation,"So to conclude my prepared remarks, I'm pleased with the progress we're making in navigating the COVID-19 pandemic, while refining our strategies to support the current and future needs of our business. We believe our third quarter results demonstrate the resiliency of our business model and the growing success of our digital platform. This combined with our compelling financial model experienced leadership team and strong balance sheet provides the necessary resources to successfully manage the business through this challenging period. On behalf of the entire leadership team, I'd like to thank our employees for your continued hard work, service and dedication.",Lee Wright,4393694
,,,,
13658,Presentation,Now let me turn the call over to George to review our financial performance.,Lee Wright,4393694
,,,,
13659,Presentation,"Thanks Lee. Over the past nine months, our balance sheet and capital position has strengthened materially because of the actions we took to mitigate the potential impact on our business of high unemployment and economic uncertainty. The business generated operating cash flow of $79.7 million during the third quarter and $385.5 million year-to-date, which is $293 million increase from the prior year-to-date period. This is primarily driven by the significant year-over-year increase in cash and third-party sales and the decline in our customer accounts receivable balance as a result of tighter underwriting and a stronger rate of cash collections.",George Bchara,4393694
,,,,
13660,Presentation,"The year-over-year increase in operating cash flow also drove a decline in net debt as a percent of the ending portfolio balance from approximately 59% at January 31, 2020, to approximately 48% at the end of the third quarter. In October, we closed our latest ABS transaction and our first since the onset of the pandemic. Our 2020-A transaction exhibited strong demand and favorable pricing. We sold the Class A and Class B notes for $240.1 million with an all in cost of funds of approximately 4.84%. This reflects the second best pricing through the Class B notes we have achieve in the ABS market, and is only 64 basis points higher than our last pre-COVID transaction.",George Bchara,4393694
,,,,
13661,Presentation,"We also chose to retain the $52.9 million of Class B notes issued in the transaction based on our strong liquidity position and the current capital needs of the business. The Class B notes may be sold at a later date to support the future liquidity of the business. At October 31, 2020, we had total cash immediately available liquidity of approximately $384.7 million, which included $107.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and $276.9 million of availability under our existing revolving credit facility. We believe this provided more than enough liquidity to support the current needs of our business, and on November 30 2020, we announced the cash tender offer were up to $100 million of our 7.25% senior notes that mature in July of 2022. We expect to complete the tender by the end of the calendar year. As you can see, our capital position and liquidity remains strong and we are proactively managing our cost of funds, while ensuring we have the financial resources to support the long term needs of our business.",George Bchara,4393694
,,,,
13662,Presentation,,George Bchara,4393694
,,,,
13663,Presentation,"Moving to our financial results. On a consolidated basis, revenues were $334.2 million for the third quarter, representing an 11.1% decline from the same period last fiscal year. We reported GAAP net income of $0.25 per diluted share for the third quarter compared to GAAP net income of $0.39 per diluted share for the same period last fiscal years. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusting for certain charges and credits, we reported net income of $0.25 per diluted share for the third quarter compared to net income of $0.49 per diluted share for the same period last fiscal year. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures are available in our third quarter earnings press release that was issued this morning. Our financial results for the third quarter reflect the success of our cost savings initiatives. Consolidated SG&A expenses were $122.2 million, a $3.4 million decline from the prior year. Year-to-date, consolidated SG&A expenses have declined $20.6 million from the prior fiscal year period. While we remain focused on cost controls, we expect fourth quarter SG&A expense to be approximately flat year-over-year.",George Bchara,4393694
,,,,
13664,Presentation,"Looking at our retail segment in more detail. Total retail revenues for the third quarter were $259.9 million, a 7.3% decline from the same period last fiscal year. Retail gross margin for the third quarter was 38.3%, a decrease of 90 basis points from the same period last fiscal year. A decline in RSA commissions and retrospective income as a result of lower sales of Conn?s in-house financing was the primary driver of the year-over-year decline in retail gross margin. We expect this will continue to put pressure on our retail gross margin on a year-over-year basis during the fourth quarter. Retail segment operating income was $15.2 million compared to $19.6 million for the same period last fiscal year primarily due to lower retail sales and lower retail gross margins, partially offset by reductions in retail SG&A expense.",George Bchara,4393694
,,,,
13665,Presentation,"Turning to our credit segment. Finance charges and other revenues were $74.2 million during the third quarter. The 22.5% decline from the same period last fiscal year was primarily due to a 16% reduction in the average balance of the customer receivable portfolio, lower insurance commissions due to a decline without the sale of our in-house credit financing and a decline in insurance retrospective income. For the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, we expect finance charges and other revenue to be down year-over-year primarily due to a lower balance of loans. Our provision for bad debts continues to benefit from a decline in the allowance for bad debts as a result of a shrinking portfolio balance, which was magnified by higher reserve percentages under CECL. In addition, during the third quarter, the allowance for bad debts declined as a result of a decline in forecasted unemployment rates. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in our allowance related to accounts that received the COVID-19 payment deferral based on the portfolio performance of these accounts. As a result our third quarter provision for bad debts was $27.4 million compared to $45.4 million for the same period last fiscal year despite higher year-over-year charge offs.",George Bchara,4393694
,,,,
13666,Presentation,"Our credit spread for the third quarter was 6.4%, a 420 basis point increase from the credit spread of 2.2% last quarter. Credit segment loss before taxes improved to a loss of $2.7 million compared to a loss before taxes of $4.3 million for the same period last fiscal year. The year-over-year improvement is driven by a decline in the provision for bad debts, which reflects a stronger cash production rate, newer higher quality originations and the reduction in the portfolio balance as a result of higher cash and third-party sales. Finally, the third quarter tax rate was 41% compared to 24.8% for the same period last fiscal year. Year-over-year increase in the effective tax rate is driven by $1.7 million discreet tax expense recognized in the current period as a result of a reversal of a tax loss carry back that was recognized earlier this year. We expect to recognize a discreet tax benefit from the fourth quarter as a result of tax planning in connection with the CARES Act.",George Bchara,4393694

13668,Presentation,"So, with this overview, Norm, Lee and I, are happy to take your answer your question. Operator, please open the call up to questions.",George Bchara,4393694
,,,,
13669,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now be conducting a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Rick Nelson with Stephens.",Operator,4393694
,,,,
13670,Question-and-Answer,"Norm, George, or Lee, what do you think is driving the sequential improvement that you saw, I think same store sales returning the third quarter and the fourth quarter to date? And if you could get more specific around those trends, especially the Black Friday period?",Rick Nelson,4393694
,,,,
13671,Question-and-Answer,"So as Lee mentioned in his comments, we saw improvement each month through the third quarter on same-store sales and continue to see improvements as we mentioned in the month of November, so very pleased. We have not changed from a credit underwriting standpoint where we've been in mid-March. So, it's not because of anything we're doing on the credit side of the house. It's really being driven by cash at third-party customer, the combination of Synchrony cash and lease-to-own, and the improvement year-over-year is driving that.",Norm Miller,4393694
,,,,
13672,Question-and-Answer,"Are you having more aggressive right, I guess on promotions we could see some margin declines year-over-year?",Rick Nelson,4393694
,,,,
13673,Question-and-Answer,"No, I would say our promotions are fairly consistent year-over-year. That's certainly not what's driving it. I think the execution is better, and I think some of our e-commerce efforts for the very first time we've never had buy online pick up in store. We implemented that in the month of November, late-October and that has been doing very well for us, helping to drive our e-commerce sales as well. So, the digital and e-commerce side as well as the non-comp financing side are really the primary drivers of what's driving the sales, and that's why we're so bullish about next year because as we look at the opportunities on the Conn?s financing on the credit side, we know we will have opportunities there next year to help us from a same-store sales side. So, to be at what 20% impact of same-store sales and only be down 10.5% speaks to the power of the business model and what we believe our opportunity is for next year.",Norm Miller,4393694
,,,,
13674,Question-and-Answer,"And one thing just to add on a category0specific basis is clearly we're pleased with the strength in appliances, but also the improvement we saw in furniture and mattress, which has been an important category. So, we were pleased to see that continued progression.",Lee Wright,4393694
,,,,
13675,Question-and-Answer,"Can you speak to the e-commerce penetration, where you stand there, and these recent recommendations from the CDC to avoid in the store shopping, and have you seen any change in customer behavior?",Rick Nelson,4393694
,,,,
13676,Question-and-Answer,"Rick, we certainly -- there's no question that customers are more reluctant to enter into a showroom. So, we were pleased to see obviously our overall growth in e-commerce. But again, if you think about our e-commerce opportunity, we think we have a unique opportunity to grow that significantly today. For the last 12 months, we're basically at 2% balance of sales from e-commerce, and we think we have the ability to grow that significantly by multiples as customers get more accustomed to shopping online. As you guys know, we've started to invest and have been investing significantly. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we?ll continue to invest and that's an important channel for us that we really -- we're going to be that omnichannel retailer and that we will be there for our customer whether they want to shop online or in our showroom, and certainly have the broader spectrum of financing options, which we think we have the unique ability to offer to our customers.",Lee Wright,4393694
,,,,
13677,Question-and-Answer,"And then shifting to the credit side, I am curious for where you think [losses] are going to shake out, especially in the recent [Technical Difficulty] as we look at the credit laws and data, and it looks like things are widening a bit there, if you could comment, and what your expectation is?",Rick Nelson,4393694
,,,,
13678,Question-and-Answer,,Rick Nelson,4393694
,,,,
13679,Question-and-Answer,"Rick, I think clearly, you're looking for the FY '20 vintage, which obviously we've discussed in previous calls where we had some higher risk, and obviously we knew we were going to and we talked about that, that we would have higher charge-offs from there. One of the things we did included in that table, though, which we think is important as you think about progression, clearly you can see the higher interest rates, the yield that we're getting. So that offsets it. But again, clearly, as I talked about in my prepared remarks, we've got TJ on board, our Chief Credit Officer. We're doing some things from a credit perspective that we think is very exciting, and we talked about being able to approve more but maintain the level of risks.",Lee Wright,4393694
,,,,
13680,Question-and-Answer,"So we're excited about what we have going forward. As we work with TJ looking at new credit scorecards, new systems, we think we have unique opportunities, so we're pleased going forward. And I guess the last thing I would tell you, Rick and I know you are focused on the losses. But clearly, with CECL we reserve at a full lifetime loss. So those reserves are incorporated. So really there's nothing that we're going to see unexpected as we look going forward, because we're reserving full lifetime losses.",Lee Wright,4393694
,,,,
13681,Question-and-Answer,"Remember Rick, we took a significant -- with CECL that changed the CECL at the beginning of the year. So we believe we're adequately reserved even for those underwriting changes we made last summer that clearly impacted for losses in the back half of fiscal '20. However, with fiscal '21, since the pandemic very, very positive with FPDs and 60-day delinquencies and those trends that will bode for a strong performance going forward into next year.",Norm Miller,4393694
,,,,
13682,Question-and-Answer,Our next question comes from the line of Brad Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets.,Operator,4393694
,,,,
13683,Question-and-Answer,"Just want to follow-up on that last topic around the underwriting trends. I mean there?s clearly a number of metrics that would indicate that the customer is going into the portfolio of late has set up a backdrop for one of the stronger portfolios you've had in some time. I guess could you help to quantify to some degree what sort of opportunity you might have to loosen or return maybe to normal into what prior trends were, what kind of benefit that might be able to be to sales as you get comfortable that the world is getting more normal?",Brad Thomas,4393694
,,,,
13684,Question-and-Answer,"So what I would say, Brad, is you're right. I mean, the portfolio, both from a size standpoint, as well as a performance standpoint, probably both smaller and stronger perform and then anytime in the last six or seven years for certain, maybe longer than that. What that bodes to is with [TJ] coming aboard and not just [TJ], we've added additional resources there as well. It really does two things. Number one, we?re aggressively at more than we've ever done going after the non-financing side of the house, folks who are e-commerce, as well as Lee mentioned on the lease to own side [Technical Difficulty] we still believe we have there, but also as the world's gets a little more normal and hopefully, we come out of the pandemic early part of next year, our expectation is that 20% that we've taken a cut to in that there's a material amount of that we believe that we will be able to start taking greater risk with. Will it be 20%? No, we don't believe we'll need to go to that to be able to have positive same-store sales. But we believe there's material opportunity there in the first half of next year.",Norm Miller,4393694
,,,,
13685,Question-and-Answer,"And Norm, you talked about the plans to continue opening in Florida next year. If I'm not mistaken, you talk about eight to 10 stores next year in the past. Is that still the plan? And can you give us some sense of the timing of those openings? And maybe George, any color on next year, early color you might be able to share about how to think about the SG&A and P&L implications from getting the store openings going?",Brad Thomas,4393694
,,,,
13686,Question-and-Answer,,Brad Thomas,4393694
,,,,
13687,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah, I'll start initially with the stores stuff. Yeah, eight to 10 is the right number that we're targeting. Most of those will -- we expect to be the vast majority of those to be in Florida as we leverage the new distribution center that opens in January. A significant portion of the stores will be in the first half of the year, even the first quarter. So I think George had mentioned on SG&A that we would be flattish year-over-year in the fourth quarter. This cut, the quarter we're now, part of that is because we're incurring expenses as we talk as we get ready to open new stores in Florida.",Norm Miller,4393694
,,,,
13688,Question-and-Answer,"And our guidance around pre-opening expenses, Brad, hasn't changed. So we would still expect to see something around $250,000 to $350,000 per new store in the first six months preceding the opening. But now that we're opening eight to 10 stores next year compared to nine stores this year on a year-over-year basis, you won't see as much of an impact to SG&A. But remember, as you're looking at SG&A next year relative to this year, it's going to be higher on a dollar basis because of some of the cost cuts we put in place that have now we started to re-spend here in the back half of the year.",George Bchara,4393694
,,,,
13689,Question-and-Answer,Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer & Company.,Operator,4393694
,,,,
13690,Question-and-Answer,"So I think a bit of a follow up to Rick and Brad's questions too. But on the first off, congratulation, we?ve seen the significant benefits to tighter lendings there on your financials. The question I have is, the sales that you're -- with the lendings there's been tight, so you're foregoing some sales. Any idea where those sales would be going? And then the question I have, another question is, as you -- as the environment allows you to get maybe little more aggressive with your lending standards. Is there the risk that you run having disappointed or distance yourself from those customers they may not return?",Brian Nigel,4393694
,,,,
13691,Question-and-Answer,"The first question as far as those customers that don't get approved from a Conn financing standpoint, their options really are very -- are fairly limited. They can they can go to a lease to own option either in our store or to a rent to own store. And as you know, a number of retailers as well have lease to own off, a number of big box retailers have lease to own options as well, or they go to a cheaper item that they cash, that they typically would not have another opportunity from a financing standpoint. And then regarding the second question, Lee, you want to?",Norm Miller,4393694
,,,,
13692,Question-and-Answer,"And Brian, just to go back to clearly, with regards to -- it?s why we talked about the importance of the LCO. You know the fact that we are declining more, we want to make sure, which is as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're working with our existing partner very closely on making sure that we're maximizing opportunities with the client that we have, but as I mentioned we're testing some additional solutions out there as well. That's one piece. And then to the extent that we disappointed customers and will they come back but clearly, I think that you know and we offer best class financing solution for those customers for their needed home goods. And obviously we have the ability to remarket to them as well. So I mean, we want to make sure that we're giving them an appropriate experience so that we can bring them back. We're keeping track of it. So good news, we've been around for a long time. But it is a good question, Brian. But we?ll obviously do to stay in touch with those customers and bring them back to the fold we believe, especially with our digital marketing as well.",Lee Wright,4393694
,,,,
13693,Question-and-Answer,"And at the 29% APR that we're at, they really don't have that option if they want to finance it someplace else. And we recognize that and they do as well, and why we offer the lease to own. And as Lee said, frankly, we've been disappointed with the balance of sale on lease to own and believe firmly in our -- and I'm very confident we will get north of 10% their balance to sales here into the coming year.",Norm Miller,4393694
,,,,
13694,Question-and-Answer,,Norm Miller,4393694
,,,,
13695,Question-and-Answer,"Then just one quick follow up, just so I understand the math. And Lee, I think you went and in prepared comments, you said that the actions you?ve taken and find with some supply constraints have reduced your sales by 20%. But does that mean comps are down about 10%, without those factors your comp would be plus 10%, is it that simple?",Brian Nigel,4393694
,,,,
13696,Question-and-Answer,No.,Norm Miller,4393694
,,,,
13697,Question-and-Answer,Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Carr with Jefferies.,Operator,4393694
,,,,
13698,Question-and-Answer,"Congrats on the positive impacts to credit performance, it's definitely shown out to-date this year. Just first question from me, obviously, you are going -- you are adopting more along the lease to own side, as well as Synchrony. Just curious where you think it'll shake out in terms of where your -- where Conn?s percentage of financing is going to be, last quarter is a little bit under 50%. This quarter you're 52%. So really taking into account the 10% lease to own share where you think you'll really be running from your part of the book financing?",Ryan Carr,4393694
,,,,
13699,Question-and-Answer,"So we've been very -- I?ve been very cautious about giving a number, because we really are not targeting a set percentage within the pie. Because our goal is not just to reallocate the pieces of the pie but most importantly, to grow the pie overall. Having said that -- so as long as we can underwrite from a risk standpoint and we're comfortable with that with what we're putting in place, very comfortable with Conn financing being more than the 52% it was for this quarter, certainly being up to 60 or even over 60. Historically, it's been as high as the high 60s. So we're comfortable at those percentages with the appropriate risk from in-house standpoint. But same time we think the growth opportunity on Synchrony cash customers. If you look at Synchrony and cash customers combined, over the last quarter, it's almost 40% of the business versus pre-COVID, it was 25% of the business or thereabout approximately.",Norm Miller,4393694
,,,,
13700,Question-and-Answer,"So will it stay at that level? We're comfortable there and certainly marketing and going after that business on an ongoing basis. And that's why I really can't put a number of saying here's what the percentage should be. Because we want to let it play out with whatever the customer wants from a financing standpoint, as long as we're comfortable with in house financing that we can do that with appropriate risk. We'll let the percentages fall whether they may. But I would expect Conn financing to move up over the next year higher than the 52% because of the significant opportunity we have there.",Norm Miller,4393694
,,,,
13701,Question-and-Answer,"And then I guess within that as well, you saw record cash collections year-to-date. I mean, do you see the same performance from a cash purchase perspective, are you seeing the same trends in that regard, or what have you observed to date on that?",Ryan Carr,4393694
,,,,
13702,Question-and-Answer,"As I said before, I mean, our cash collection -- the cash we're generating and collecting is a combination of two things. Number one, collecting at a higher level from the portfolio standpoint but also collecting more cash from third party transactions as well, which include not only cash but Synchrony and lease to own as well. So all of that impact on the cash collected. And we continue to see that, as Lee mentioned I think in his comments, we're at a 10 year high of cash collections in the third quarter and even going on into the fourth quarter and we continue to see it perform nicely above prior year, which as you know that certainly helps from a portfolio performance standpoint significantly.",Norm Miller,4393694
,,,,
13703,Question-and-Answer,"And last one from me, delinquencies were up a bit quarter to quarter. I mean is that just a function of the lower portfolio balance or what really caused the decline, or the increase there? ",Ryan Carr,4393694
,,,,
13704,Question-and-Answer,"It's really a couple of things. First, seasonality wise, third quarter is typically the highest order of things, the quarters from a delinquency standpoint. And then it's really the denominator effect is the primary driver. 60 day dollars are actually down but the portfolio is declining at a faster rate than the 60 day dollars are going down.",Norm Miller,4393694
,,,,
13705,Question-and-Answer,,Norm Miller,4393694
,,,,
13706,Question-and-Answer,"And as you know, Ryan, it's a seasonal impact as well, which you see going from Q2 to Q3. And from a dollar perspective, looking year-over-year is only up about $10 million versus $20 million last year as well.",Lee Wright,4393694
,,,,
13707,Question-and-Answer,Our next question comes from the line of Bill Ryan with Compass Point.,Operator,4393694
,,,,
13708,Question-and-Answer,"A question on the allowance and the provision, sort of looking back when you adopted CECL. The allowance level looks to be about 20 -- just under 21% of receivables, closer to 25% right now. I know you're holding reserves up fairly high. Just in I guess it's a not knowing how everything's going to perform kind of the wait and see mentality of things. But looking at it going forward with the tight origination standards that you have, credit eventually kind of working its way through one way or another. I mean, is it fair to assume that the provisioning rate on the new receivables will be that reserve level might drift lower than where it was at the beginning of the year?",Bill Ryan,4393694
,,,,
13709,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, that is a -- over the long term with a significantly lower balance of sale Conn finnacing as we've seen with much higher quality underwriting, it is fair to assume that over time the allowance rate will drift down below where it was before. The one key factor, as you pointed out, Bill, is the fact that we've got a significant reserve still on the balance sheet associated with the increase in forecasted unemployment rates. And so that's the ex factor in terms of whether when we will actually start to see the reserve percentages drift down below where they were when we adopted CECL.",Lee Wright,4393694
,,,,
13710,Question-and-Answer,"Not only that, Bill, in addition, as you heard in the comments, I think, our reages and our TCR balances and percentages are coming down as well. And we've done that proactively and aggressively to derisk the portfolio. And as you know, those are reserved at materially higher rates. So as those balances continue to come down and we focus there that will ultimately result in a lower allowance and provision as well.",Norm Miller,4393694
,,,,
13711,Question-and-Answer,"And just one follow up a little bit more granular but on the provision in the quarter. You mentioned, there's a couple of factors kind of one push but it is little higher, one was a little bit lower, the benefit being a lower unemployment rate. If you net those two out, were they kind of a wash on those two factors mean the provision is kind of like, net, net kind of a fair number to use relative to the originations that you're putting on the books for the quarter?",Bill Ryan,4393694
,,,,
13712,Question-and-Answer,"The two factors were a wash when you look at it on a relative basis. Bill, the primary driver of the decrease in the allowance portfolio [indiscernible] quarter-over-quarter, so the allowance rate was about flat quarter from a quarter.",Lee Wright,4393694
,,,,
13713,Question-and-Answer,There are no further questions. I'd like to hand the call back to Mr. Miller for his closing remarks.,Operator,4393694
,,,,
13714,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you. We appreciate everyone's interest in the company, and look forward to talking to everyone at the conclusion of our fourth quarter. Wishing everyone a Merry Christmas and a Happy Holidays. Thank you.",Norm Miller,4393694

,,,,
13720,Presentation,"I'll now turn the call over to Wiley's President and CEO, Brian Napack.",Brian Campbell,4393687
,,,,
13721,Presentation,"Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining today. Our performance this quarter underscores the value of Wiley?s role in the global economy. Through the year, we've seen an acceleration of the trends that have defined our markets for years. And this is driving a strong increase in the demand for scientific research and online education. Our first half performance demonstrates that our longstanding strategy to lead an open research in digital career focused education is paying off, especially in these extraordinary and challenging times.",Brian Napack,4393687
,,,,
13722,Presentation,"Now, more than ever, the world is turning to research and education to help solve its unprecedented challenges. Scientific research is firmly in the spotlight and is more and more integrated into both corporate strategy and public policy. As part of the United Nations? sustainable development goals, countries have pledged to substantially increase their R&D spending and their number of researchers by 2030. Today, as always, we see investment flowing into the most critical fields of study, including areas such as renewable energy, artificial intelligence, and of course, vaccine science. This demonstrates how peer reviewed research always remains essential to both problem-solving and innovation. At research institutions worldwide, demand to publish high quality research keeps growing, and this is evidenced by a rapidly increasing publishing output. The demand to apply this research is also growing rapidly. And this shows in the record consumption of scientific content on our platforms. ",Brian Napack,4393687
,,,,
13723,Presentation,"COVID-19 has brought the future of education forward, accelerating the digital transformation of learning in universities and companies; and now of course, in our homes. Career enhancing education is increasingly delivered online and it is finally becoming more affordable and more broadly available, exactly what the world needs. Once again, post-secondary education is proving to be countercyclical as people seek a leg up in a tough job market. Despite the practical challenges of delivering education in a pandemic, enrollment this fall in both four-year and graduate degree programs has been much better than initially anticipated. And we've seen very strong demand for our online degree programs. We've seen similar growth in our digital content and courseware, as people have pivoted to these lower priced, higher impact products. Beyond the traditional degree, demand is also increasing for new forms of credentials that are more focused and more affordable. And that demonstrate that workers have exactly the skills that employers need most. Across Wiley, we view our role is to connect education to career outcomes. The pandemic has only accelerated the global focus on closing the skill gap, especially in areas such as IT and digital skills. And this has validated our focus on these areas. ",Brian Napack,4393687
,,,,
13724,Presentation,,Brian Napack,4393687
,,,,
13725,Presentation,"Our strategy and research has been consistent, publish more and publish better, accelerate profitable growth and education services and drive growth in online curriculum and courseware. Our investments in these areas are producing results. Research Publishing & Platforms delivered robust growth again this quarter with increasing profitability driven by continued gains in open access. In Education Services, we continue to deliver strong online enrollment growth and win university partnerships. Importantly, we exceeded our fiscal ?22 EBITDA margin goal of 15% both in the second quarter and for the first half of fiscal ?21. As a reminder, our Ed Services plan is for double-digit revenue growth with sustainable EBITDA margin of at least 15%. In Academic & Professional Learning, Education Publishing continue to gain momentum as the digital transformation of university education accelerated with revenue growth in digital content and courseware now outpacing the decline of print book sales. We continue to gain share in this highly competitive market. ",Brian Napack,4393687
,,,,
13726,Presentation,"Professional Learning remains weighed down by COVID-19 lockdowns, particularly in the face-to-face corporate training, although we are seeing very good early results from our rapid transition to online delivery. We continue to drive cost savings throughout Wiley and the pandemic has allowed us to move even faster. As a digital company with a mission-driven culture, we transitioned rather seamlessly to a virtual operating model. Based on this success, we will be enabling more of our Wiley colleagues to work remotely post-COVID, allowing us to reduce our real estate footprint and generate material run rate savings. ",Brian Napack,4393687
,,,,
13727,Presentation,"Finally, Wiley?s free cash flow through the first half was $32 million ahead of prior year, primarily due to improved earnings. ",Brian Napack,4393687
,,,,
13728,Presentation,"Let's talk about our Q2 results in more detail. Growth in our areas of strategic focus, such is research, online education and digital courseware offset COVID-driven declines in print books, test prep and in-person corporate training. Revenue rose 4% over prior year and was even on an organic basis. Our earnings improvement this quarter was primarily driven by good top-line performance, cost improvement from business optimization and COVID-related savings. Adjusted EPS and EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA were up 7% and 12%. On a GAAP basis, we reported an additional $14 million discreet tax benefit related to the U.S. CARES Act. For the half, revenue was up 3% over prior year to $922 million. Adjusted EPS was up 33% to $1.41 and adjusted EBITDA was up 19% to $202 million.",Brian Napack,4393687
,,,,
13729,Presentation,"Our strategies in research to grow open access to drive platform growth and optimize our publishing operations continue to bear fruit, with revenue and adjusted EBITDA up 5% and 14%. Our adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter was 37%, up from 35% in the prior year period. Underlying the business, we see very strong growth in article output, up 22% over prior year. Some of the increase can be attributed to the unique environment we're in with the largest growth coming from pandemic-related subject areas like clinical medicine and epidemiology. That said, we believe strong demand to publish is here to stay. It's important to note that demand was very robust prior to COVID-19 with article submissions up 9% in the nine months through January 2020. So we're seeing strong secular growth in the demand to publish, which of course directly benefits us, especially as we grow the volume-driven open access model. ",Brian Napack,4393687

As a reminder, these multi-year agreements are a combination of pay-to-read and pay-to-publish models. And they are typically done with large national consortia in places like Germany and the UK. We're seeing great momentum coming from these agreements in the form of increased article output and new publishing opportunities. This quarter, we launched Natural Sciences, a major new flagship journal brand created in partnership with the influential Projekt DEAL consortium out of Germany.

Revenue from our Research Platforms rose 11% on new customer launches for Literatum, our industry-leading content distribution platform. Our customer retention rate on a trailing 12 month basis continues to be an exceptional 98%. Corporate solutions, which is another growth area for us in research, continues to gain momentum. For example, we've been expanding our career center platform offerings, and this is starting to pay off in even deeper relationships with our leading network of societies, associations and corporations.

13734,Presentation,"In the second half, we have two key objectives. First, successfully close calendar year ?21 subscription renewals; and second, take full advantage of the continued strong demand to publish in our journals. Through October, we closed about 20% of our annual renewals compared to 16% at this time last year, and we've made great progress in renewing key accounts. That said, we continue to anticipate modest pricing pressure in subscriptions due to COVID-related constraints and library budgets. But we expect to offset this with strong growth in open access, where revenue is a direct function of the quantity of articles published. ",Brian Napack,4393687
,,,,
13735,Presentation,"As a market leader with nearly 1,700 journal brands and an unmatched reputation, we're in a terrific position to publish more, including publishing more of the submissions we receive. In the nine months of calendar year ?20, we received over 600,000 submissions, accepting around 25% of them. Many rejected manuscripts are high quality, but just don't fit a particular journal. We continue to improve the efficiency and transferring these articles to other Wiley journals, where they do fit without sacrificing quality. We're now using artificial intelligence to seamlessly evaluate and route articles to appropriate journals. ",Brian Napack,4393687

13736,Presentation,"Given the breadth of our journal portfolio, this cascading capability provides an important competitive advantage and source of growth. Overall, researchers want their work published in the best journals possible, and they want it published faster and they want it made more discoverable. Thus, we continue to enhance our publishing portfolio and drive innovation throughout the publishing process. This allows us to consistently improve the impact of our journal brands and the value proposition for researchers. As part of this, we continue to reduce publishing cycle times, which increases researcher satisfaction while also improving our margins. In Academic & Professional Learning, we continue to deliver on our strategies to grow digital content in courseware focused on career-oriented disciplines and pivot to online corporate training. Education Publishing revenue was even with prior year as digital growth offset print decline, and the impact of COVID-19 on test print. Digital content revenue rose 32% in zyBooks, our STEM courseware platform rose 46%. ",Brian Napack,4393687

Notably, fall enrollment numbers in higher education continue to be better than we had anticipated in the early days of COVID, although still down around 4% overall. In the past two years, we've been saying that our strategy to drive digital adoption would allow us to return to growth by driving significantly higher digital units from increased sell-through as we use digital courseware to recapture units that were lost to the sale of print books through non-revenue generating channels. As you can see in our strong digital growth, the strategy is working, and we'll continue to capitalize on this favorable momentum. As noted, Professional Learning continues to be adversely affected by COVID-19. Revenue was down 13% primarily due to severe limitations on in-person training. Results improved in the second quarter, as we shifted to virtual learning, grew trade publishing output and benefited from some improvement in our bookstore business. ",Brian Napack,4393687

Strong gains in our traditional tuition share programs were partially offset by lower sales of unbundled services as some clients were constrained by COVID-related budget issues.

13750,Presentation,"Thank you, Brian. Our cash flow from operations and free cash flow were favorable to prior year by $23 million and $32 million respectively, primarily due to improved earnings, partially offset by unfavorable timing of working capital items. As a reminder, cash flow is normally a use of cash in the first half of our fiscal year due to the timing of collections for journal subscriptions, which are concentrated in the third and fourth quarters. Our strong balance sheet, consistency of annual cash flows and ample liquidity, afford us the flexibility to continue investing, acquiring and returning cash to shareholders. Capital expenditures, including technology, property and equipment and product development spending, were $47 million through the second quarter, roughly $9 million lower than prior year. We expect full year capital expenditures to be approximately $100 million with investment focused on adding and enhancing tech-enabled products and services in our core focus areas along with continued investment in process optimization and workflow automation.

13767,Presentation,[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Daniel Moore with CJS Securities. Your line is now open.,Operator,4393687
,,,,
13768,Presentation,"Brian, John, good morning. Congrats on a really solid results. Thanks for taking the questions. Let me start with the -- call the online program management. But segment already exceeded your goal of 15% margin. Do we anticipate being able to sustain that level of profitability from here going forward? Just wondering if there's anything unusual in terms of seasonality or some of the investments in H2 might push that down before it comes back up? ",Daniel Moore ,4393687
,,,,
13769,Presentation,"Yes. I'll let John answer that after an initial comment. Basically, we set a target of 15 plus percent. We're over that now. We're very pleased and proud of that. We believe that we can operate this business consistently as we should profitably, while growing it significantly. And I think that the expectation we should have going forward is the 15 plus percent. There is definitely some seasonality and some ebbs and flows as the year goes through. So I would basically reinforce the expectation rather than setting the expectation at a significantly higher level that we've already achieved. John, do you have anything add to that? ",Brian Napack,4393687
,,,,
13770,Presentation,"Very little other than to say yes, I completely agree that the year-to-date trend is a better way to think about sustainable performance. They are in line with our expectations around driving growth. So there is some seasonality. The six months trend is a better indicator of the momentum of our business there.",John Kritzmacher,4393687
,,,,
13771,Presentation,"Very helpful. Switching gears, talk a little bit less about it typically, but corporate and Professional Learning, wondering if you anticipate the switch to digital delivery that you're -- have taken obviously in midst pandemic, do you expect that to remain somewhat permanent and what implications might be for growth in margins longer term?",Daniel Moore,4393687
,,,,
13772,Presentation,"Yes, it?s a great question. In corporate, like everywhere else and we've certainly seen it in our higher ed businesses, the transition to digital teaching and learning digital training is one that comes at the expense of some very long and well-established trends and behaviors. We were extremely positively surprised by how well we would have been recovering from the initial shutdown of in-person training. It's bounced back significantly better than we thought. For example, originally we were down 70% and you can imagine, right, no in-person training means very little activity for us there. But already we're back to down 30% and that's terrific. And at this point, I believe it's 80% or 85% -- I think 85% we had in the comments, are already virtual and we're getting people who are partners and companies who had said they would never go to virtual, all of a sudden doing virtual. So we do expect that this has allowed us, as it has across our business to lock in the digital transition in many of the places now where teaching and learning exists. ",Brian Napack,4393687
,,,,
13773,Presentation,,Brian Napack,4393687
,,,,
13774,Presentation,"So how that translates into growth and into profitability remains to be seen. But certainly trends that you've seen elsewhere as we move through digital transition should be consistent here. So yes we're moving faster than we thought, and we think we're locking in the game, but I think that's what really matters here.",Brian Napack,4393687
,,,,
13775,Presentation,"That's certainly helpful. Maybe one more, just in terms of cash generation. The guide, John 175 million to 200 million, just remind us timing, magnitude of any benefit of tax deferrals from CARES Act or if I'm getting that right? How that impacts cash flow this year? And just wondering if the $100 million CapEx is sort of the new norm? Or is that, you're sort of pulling forward some investments?",Daniel Moore,4393687
,,,,
13776,Presentation,"Sure. So with respect to the cash flow projection for the year, again, our expectations around free cash flow are being primarily driven by our earnings improvement year-over-year, and we're showing some good strength there, as indicated by the full year guides that were given. There is some adverse impact that we're anticipating with respect to working capital that's mostly due to, in some cases, elongated payment terms with certain customers, particularly on journal subscriptions. By the way, I should note that we're very pleased with our progress overall around collections. We're seeing minimal risk at this point in terms of bad debt or defaults. And so, we're making really good progress on collections. But there's some elongation that plays into our forecast for the year. The expectation with regard to the CARES Act refund is that we'll receive that refund before the end of the year. So, that will play into our cash results. I would just note though that on a year-on-year basis, our cash taxes paid within that projection will be essentially flat with that refund. So, it?s a neutralizing effect on cash taxes on this year.",John Kritzmacher,4393687
,,,,
13777,Presentation,"Very helpful, and I'm going to sneak one more in. Capital allocation, just given the strength of the balance sheet, results and stickiness of the business and free cash flow trends that we're seeing, clearly better-than-expected, I guess why wait for an economic recovery to be opportunistic from a share buyback perspective? Thanks again.",Daniel Moore,4393687
,,,,
13778,Presentation,"Dan, I would say, at this point in time, we are striking a balance between investment in the business and returning cash to shareholders, and at the same time also navigating what is somewhat of an uncertain period of time. I think we're getting closer to being on the other side of that uncertainty. And so, we continue to closely evaluate the opportunity to begin again share repurchases. But we're going to proceed with some degree of caution there. Again, looking for more economic stability before we go back deeply into our repurchase program.",Brian Napack,4393687

Then secondly on higher ed publishing. I understand you guided for mid-single-digit decline Academic & Professional Learning. But could you guide for any revenue growth you expect to see in Education Publishing. Is it fair to expect a return to sustainable growth going forward in that sub-segment? And lastly, on OPM. Can you please elaborate on what is driving the decrease in student acquisition costs? Are you seeing overall deflation in digital advertising price points for instance, or has it more to do with some company-specific cost actions that you're undertaking?

I believe it was -- well John, can you quote?",Brian Napack,4393687
,,,,
13783,Presentation,"So setting aside if you -- if we normalize for the impact of the transitional agreements that we have underway and get to, if you will, an operational number, we're on the order of 40% growth in open access publishing.",John Kritzmacher,4393687
,,,,
13784,Presentation,"Yes, which is great, right, I think that?s exceptional growth. We're seeing very strong growth in open access, great enthusiasm for our brands. The model as you know that P times Q, price times quantity model is one that we like a lot because it allows us to lock into the endemic growth into marketplace which as you know the article count in the world tends to go up by mid-to-high single-digits every year. And so we were very pleased with the growth we're showing. And it comes from a lot of different places. Certainly we're getting far more submissions than we had. We're up in the high 20s with regards to the volume of submissions. I think it's up 28%. Our article output based upon that is up 22%. And that allows us -- we get these articles, it allows us to cascade them through our system. So yes, we are feeling very good about the strong growth in open access. If that's answering the question on that? ",Brian Napack,4393687

,,,,
13787,Presentation,"Yes. I thought John was trying to break in. Never mind. Yes, with regards to the big deal -- I'm getting some feedback here, so I'm sorry if I'm a little hesitant, there's some noise on the line. But with regard to the big deal, we have seen very consistent high renewals in our base of library, subscription customers. As we discussed, we have some price pressure this year. We're seeing no evidence of an unbundling though because the bundle that we provide to our institutional clients is exceptionally important and plays a very, very important role in the success of their institutions. Research winds up very high on the top of the pile of things that they have to have in order to be successful library, successful institutions, so they have a successful research and discovery program in their universities. And so we're feeling strong and confident about that.",Brian Napack,4393687
,,,,
13788,Presentation,"With regard to higher ed -- and you asked a specific question about the expectations going forward there, higher ed is a business where print declines have gone on for some time. As we said, the digital growth is now outpacing the print decline. We're very pleased to hear that, but we do expect the print decline to continue for some time. We do expect to return that business to profitable growth, as we said. We're not providing a time horizon on it because of the uncertainties in the marketplace. But the strong growth that we're seeing in the adoption of our digital programs and the sell-through of in terms of we get in adoption, there?s a portion of the adoption students that we can monetize is significantly higher when we go digital. So the math basically says we'll do better in the long run with lower price, higher impact products with greater sell-through. So we're confident that we will return to sustainable growth and we?ll keep our eye on it. And you'll keep your eye on that in the months and years to come.",Brian Napack,4393687
,,,,
13789,Presentation,"With regards to OPM, our cost -- customer acquisition cost is -- has gone down because of an express strategy we made to improve the efficiency and the targeting of our advertising. We're much more efficient in the targeting of our advertising and in the spend. And then we are much more efficient in the conversion of the leads that we generate into students. Very important. It's been a bit of a wild ride this year, as you can imagine, because of all the disruption in the marketplace. But what we know is, students continue to be interested in getting education in order to advance their career prospects and our ability to get the right message to the right student is a testament to the efficiency and effectiveness of our marketing colleagues, and then the student journey from once that lead is acquired to once they are -- have applied and are accepted, is increasing significantly. So, we're very pleased about that. There is no evidence of costs -- the endemic market costs going down for a lead. But we're just getting better at finding the right students and converting into -- finding the right -- potential students and converting them into the actual students.",Brian Napack,4393687

A bit more constructive in the sense that if we now have digital growth offsetting print decline, why would it reverse, is print to accelerate, is digital to slow down? Or what is the uncertainty that kind of holds you back from a more affirmative outlook, now that the inflection point seems behind us?",Sami Kassab,4393687

13792,Presentation,"Well, what I would say is -- I wouldn't say the inflection point is behind us, what I would say is what I said earlier, which is that digital is now outpacing print decline. So, the issue here is that, for a number of years, the industry and we are not alone, has been looking for the bottom and print sales continue to be challenged as it continues to become less and less preferred format for the delivery and consumption of content. So, we're just being conservative in what we're saying about when we will see the benefit from it. But what we do know -- and I think it's very important. I share your confidence, but it is for -- and it is important to know that the vast majority of courses around the world are taught with content that is published by Wiley or one of the other leading publishers. And as we move from print to digital, it allows us to repatriate those sales, many of which were going through used channels or rental channels, or other sorts of non-paid channels. So we are feeling good about the business. But calling the exact moment of pivot is another story.",Brian Napack,4393687
,,,,
13793,Presentation,"So, it?s not a view that OER might become more of a competitive pressure going forward. So, your conservativeness has nothing to do with a scenario where open education resources were to gain more share?",Sami Kassab,4393687
,,,,
13794,Presentation,"No. We don't. What we have found is that, as we have -- as prices for our courseware have become more in line with expectations in the marketplace, we're gaining share, not losing share. And there is certainly a very small portion of the market that is OER at this point in time. But we participate in that market with our platforms. And so, no, we don't view that as a threat to the business and the stuff that is moving, an OER tends to be -- OER that comes at a price point. And so -- and by the way, most of the OER stuff is based again upon published content. So, no, we don't view this as a -- my comments have no reflection on the OER phenomenon.",Brian Napack,4393687
,,,,
13795,Presentation,Our next question comes from Greg Pendy with Sidoti. Your line is now open.,Operator,4393687
,,,,
13796,Presentation,Just wanted to understand the free cash flow guidance a little bit more. You mentioned a 3Q charge. Is that a cash charge or a pre-tax charge on that upwards of $15 million?,Greg Pendy,4393687
,,,,
13797,Presentation,"The Q3 charge, it will be a cash charge in the sense that -- in the sense of there are expenses that it will be -- these are facility charges, right? So there'll be cash outlays over time to continue to pay those leases. So it's cash charge in that sense, but it doesn't change the momentum of cash in the short-term. Does that help? Does that answer your question?",John Kritzmacher,4393687
,,,,
13798,Presentation,"I think so. Yes, that helps.",Greg Pendy,4393687
,,,,
13799,Presentation,"Your question is really specific to the restructuring charge, right? And more broadly, I commented earlier that we've got a few moving pieces there are working capital elements at play, given just the timing of collections and some of the impacts that we've seen around COVID on the extended payment terms with certain customers to help get through difficult time. So there's a bit of working capital movement, but the cash flows will be primarily driven by stronger earnings performance for the year, offset a bit by working capital. The restructuring charge really doesn't have a material impact on the timing of cash flows for the year. And as I said, the tax refund that we're anticipating is a neutralizing effect on cash taxes for the year as compared to prior year.",John Kritzmacher,4393687
,,,,
13800,Presentation,,John Kritzmacher,4393687
,,,,
13801,Presentation,"And then just, I guess on that topic, just trying to understand -- I know you mentioned the extended payments for the accounts receivable. Should we be thinking about that, though, as in you've gone through 20% of the renewals. So does that stay elevated for a while as you still have to work through 80% more renewals?",Greg Pendy,4393687
,,,,
13802,Presentation,"No, I would not describe this as being directly tied to the progress of renewals. We're talking about extended payment terms in very limited cases, many of which are related to the timing of government funding in various countries around the globe. But I wouldn't call the timing of our renewals an indicator per se for the broader population. It's really a -- it's a relatively narrow part of the population that is on extended payment terms.",John Kritzmacher,4393687
,,,,
13803,Presentation,"Okay, great. And then just one final one, just on the inflection point, just trying to understand that -- in digital versus print declines, and just trying to understand that how much of that is potentially just being -- I know it's being accelerated given COVID, and you've mentioned that, but how many students are potentially getting courseware bundled with their courses as they are online and may pivot back to print, I guess, if classes sort of return in-person? Is that a potential, maybe step -- slight step back that we might see? Not that the trend doesn't continue towards digital, but just trying to understand given the inflection point.",Greg Pendy,4393687
,,,,
13804,Presentation,"Yes, it's always a good question. The human behavior changes typically slowly. In this case, we've seen a very rapid change. And what we see across our client base is that students and professors are adopting first because they had to because digital -- you just need the digital environment, if you're going to teach virtually. But now, what they're realizing is that it's working, and that they can do so much more with it. We don't view -- but in terms of a bundle, they're not getting -- there are certainly bundles in this business, but the courses are typically -- the content is not typically bundled, with the course. The student typically has to go out and purchase that bundle, purchase that product themselves for the course. So, there's not a bundling unbundling effect, to be clear, Greg. There may be some professors or some students that choose to return to print, but we typically haven't seen that. The trends for satisfaction with digital products, particularly versus print products has been increasing consistently over the years and is well above 50% now. And so, because of that, what we see is that this will be locked in and move forward -- will move forward with the digital units. I can't say, there won't be some -- some come back. But, no, we view the acceleration of trends as an acceleration of trends. It's not a one-time thing to adopt to a -- adapt to an unusual event in the marketplace.",Brian Napack,4393687
,,,,
13805,Presentation,Our next question comes from the Matilda Derezano with Barclays. Your line is now open.,Operator,4393687
,,,,
13806,Presentation,"Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. I?ve got a couple. So, first, I wanted to ask, whether your guidance for low-single-digits in research for the year [indiscernible] after growth of 5% in the first half means that we should expect the journal growth to decline in calendar 2021 versus calendar 2020. And then, I wanted to ask if you could give a bit more color on the pricing pressure that you are seeing in renewals, is that limited to U.S. institutions or more global? And lastly, what changed in enrollment in 2021 versus 2020? Are you budgeting for travelling for the college textbook business? Thank you.",Matilda Derezano,4393687
,,,,
13807,Presentation,"Okay, John, why don't you pick that up, if you can? I did not get the third question. So, we may need to ask that -- we may need to repeat that one.",Brian Napack,4393687
,,,,
13808,Presentation,,Brian Napack,4393687
,,,,
13809,Presentation,"Let me respond, Brian, to the first two, and then we can come back for clarification on the third question. So, thank you. So, your question with regard to research revenue performance on the second half of the year. We are anticipating, in the research segment, modest growth in the second half, as compared to the second half of the prior year. So, you're correct. It's presumed that we will realize a slower rate of growth. Some of that in our forecast is anticipating some pricing pressure, as we've noted, around the subscription renewals for calendar year '21. Again, we continue to expect that pressure to be modest. And so far, the evidence that we've seen is consistent with that. But, we have somewhat limited visibility. So, our presumption at the moment is that we'll see some pressure there that will be pretty much offset, slightly more than offset by our growth in open access. But again, somewhat limited visibly, but those are our expectations. You have pressure on the subscription side, upside on the open access side and that those are going to, relatively speaking, balance them out.",John Kritzmacher,4393687
,,,,
13810,Presentation,"In terms of the geography around pricing pressure, I wouldn't say that it's distinguished in any particular part of the globe. As we see it today, it's largely a function of the health of the university customers that are our subscribers as research universities have a strong need for research. So far, the pricing pressure has been again limited in terms of both its breadth and depth. So, there's no particular geography that I would point to, or no particular customer base, other than the institutions that are going to struggle more here are clearly those that have weaker overall financial position than challenges around getting through a pretty difficult period.",John Kritzmacher,4393687
,,,,
13811,Presentation,Could you then repeat for us your question around 2021 enrollment?,John Kritzmacher,4393687
,,,,
13812,Presentation,"Yes. I was just wondering, basically what your expectations are for 2021 enrollments and how you're planning for that for your college textbook business compared to 2020?",Matilda Derezano,4393687
,,,,
13813,Presentation,"We haven't -- it has been a bit of a moving target since the beginning of the COVID crisis. As we indicated in our comments, enrollment has been significantly better than we expected it to be with undergraduate being down a little bit, and graduate programs and master's programs being up a little bit. Significantly community colleges were hit quite hard. But, we don't have too much exposure in this community college market. Although it is obviously an important part of the education -- the education ecosystem. And so, it's been a bit of a moving target. We haven't projected the following academic year yet. And so, we'll come back to that as we start to do an outlook for fiscal ?21, which as you know for -- excuse me, fiscal ?22, which as you know, doesn't start for us until the middle of calendar year ?21. So, no real comment on forward-looking, although we will continue to underscore that enrollment tends to be countercyclical and we expect the economic effect of COVID to last for quite some time.",Brian Napack,4393687
,,,,
13814,Presentation,Our next question comes from Matthew Walker with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.,Operator,4393687
,,,,
13815,Presentation,"I've got three questions if that?s okay. The first is on open access. You got very strong in open access revenues. My understanding is that deals that you've been done on open access that would be like an upper and lower band of revenues that the university partners would pay. So, no sort of direct linkage or exponential linkage to the volume of articles published. The thing from what you're saying that actually there is a big opportunity to generate revenue from the number of articles published. So, I was wondering if you could explain that.",Matthew Walker,4393687
,,,,
13816,Presentation,"The second question is, you've answered some questions on renewal seasons for journals and books. Have you seen any impact from universities using the unsubed company to help them get rid of unnecessary journals?",Matthew Walker,4393687
,,,,
13817,Presentation,,Matthew Walker,4393687
,,,,
13818,Presentation,"And then, the third question is, you mentioned your market share in higher education. I think, you said, I could be wrong, but it went from four to five, which is a very strong performance. That sort of implies that the market is a bit worse than your performance. So, what would your growth look like, if you hadn't gained any share at all? Thanks.",Matthew Walker,4393687
,,,,
13819,Presentation,"Got it. Hopefully, we'll be able to cover all those questions, or I should say, I'll be able to remember all those questions. We'll start with the OA growth. So first of all, let's remember that our OA growth, which is certainly very strong is made up of two parts. One part is the traditional gold OA article-by-article business, which represents roughly two-thirds of the growth that we -- a little less than two-thirds of the growth that we have talked about this year. The other is the volume that comes from our strategic deals that we've been talking about for quite some time. And so, that proportionality is important, first of all.",Brian Napack,4393687
,,,,
13820,Presentation,"Second of all, every deal is different. Every deal has a different structure and different flavor to it. So, there's no real way to fully answer your question in a single way. But, what I will say is, the model itself is built on price times quantity. And typically, there may be an upper bound, but then there are also ways for those articles to be published anyway, because the articles continue to be delivered. And in each one of our deals, there is a -- this price times quantity mechanism exists. The question is, what happens if you do come to a maximum if there is a maximum. And the answer is, those articles get published anyway. We have to figure out -- and somebody has figured out how to fund those articles.",Brian Napack,4393687
,,,,
13821,Presentation,"So, yes, there is -- every deal is different. The relationship for price to quantity remains, and it plays out in different ways, depending on the specific deals, geographies, budgets, et cetera of the cases. So, hopefully, that addresses that question.",Brian Napack,4393687
,,,,
13822,Presentation,"Brian, if I could just jump in. I would just point out that our open access business is much larger than just the transitional deals, right? They represent a significant element of our open access business. But, the majority of our business in open access is actually outside of those transitional deals. And so, there is lots of opportunity for us to drive growth out of our improvements in OA volume.",John Kritzmacher,4393687
,,,,
13823,Presentation,"Yes, yes, absolutely. And as I was saying, it's sort of a one-third, two-thirds with one-third -- a little more than one-third being the deals that John and I are talking about. If that's what you're referring to, John, I think it was.",Brian Napack,4393687
,,,,
13824,Presentation,Yes. Sorry.,John Kritzmacher,4393687
,,,,
13825,Presentation,"No. It's fine, fine. Great. The second question was on renewals and the ability or desire of the universities or the librarians to use different sorts of services and different sorts of approaches to more -- to figure out how to reduce their paid commitments. And we have not seen this is -- it?s certainly in the marketplace, certainly any smart buyer is always looking for ways to make sure they're only paying for what they really need and really use. And in fact, our relationships over the years have become increasingly focused on the performance, meaning the usage of the subscriptions that people are paying for, meaning the access to the content. We've talked extensively about how significantly higher, how significantly elevated those have become over the last couple of years as our usage of our content increases, certainly accelerating in this past year. So, there is less belief than you might expect that it is not something that they ought to be paying for. And we have not seen a material impact of any third-party services that seek to help libraries tailor their subscriptions. We haven't seen that effect in any material way on our business.",Brian Napack,4393687
,,,,
13826,Presentation,,Brian Napack,4393687
,,,,
13827,Presentation,"Then the last question. Let me see if I can recall it now. Market share. So, yes, our market share has been increasing, and we are very pleased with that. We're seeing it in increased adoptions, and increased sell-through as we succeed with our programs. You will remember, if you've been following the story, which all of you have, that we took an approach of being very active and aggressive in our pricing in order to make sure that students and schools had access to reasonable pricing, which would drive, in theory, unit sales. And happily, what we've learned is as we significantly reduced our price points and simplified our models and increased the models by which people could get access to content for cheaper, that our volume increases significantly offset our -- significantly offset our -- the effect of our price reduction. So, that's really good to hear. Right? So, what we've been talking about for a long time is the normalization of pricing and value, where in the marketplace for higher ed content, there was perception that there wasn't enough volume delivered and the prices were too high. And everyone's familiar with that story. Right? The $250 textbook.",Brian Napack,4393687
,,,,
13828,Presentation,"Well, now, we're seeing price point -- we?ve driven price points down to the -- in many cases $50, $60. And as we do that and in a very simple structure, and as we've done that, what we've seen is we repatriate more units than we're losing in that. And therefore, we're giving these -- these digital products, which has significantly elevated value because of the homework system, that community, the ability to collaborate on these systems for teachers to work with students directly, so with elevated outcomes, elevated value at a significantly lower price. And therefore, the marketplace is kind of happy with it and rewards it. And we've been particularly aggressive in that area.",Brian Napack,4393687
,,,,
13829,Presentation,"So, the market is sold that a lot of noise in the market as print declines and the digital grows. But, what we are clear and confident on is that we are doing very well relative to the market because of the various actions we?ve taken to both increase quality, reduce price and ultimately service the market in a very, very tailored way.",Brian Napack,4393687
,,,,
13830,Presentation,"The other thing to say is, we tend to focus -- we're much more focused than most of -- than most of the larger competitors. We are focused on areas where the content is absolutely necessary for the course -- for the student to be successful in a course in areas like accounting or IT and so forth. And that's why we -- that?s one of the reasons why we can do better because the students can't do without our content. So, hopefully, that gives you some color on the market share facts. And we continue to be pleased with how we're performing there.",Brian Napack,4393687
,,,,
13831,Presentation,"I think what I was trying to say is that all the people who post about being close to the tipping point, it just so happens that they individually have gained a lot of market share, but that suggests that the underlying market is not as healthy if you haven't gained any market share.",Matthew Walker,4393687
,,,,
13832,Presentation,"I would argue that you should study the industry statistics closely, and you'll see that there has materially been share shifts, and there has been consistent increase in the number of units sold in the industry. So, we won't go into discussion of relative performance to competitors. But, what we can say is that we feel in the long run, we will have the units in the unit growth, and we will have -- we will continue to perform well relative to our competitors.",Brian Napack,4393687
,,,,
13833,Presentation,Okay. Thank you very much. Thanks for the help.,Matthew Walker,4393687
,,,,
13834,Presentation,We have a follow-up question from the line of Daniel Moore with CJS Securities. Your line is now open.,Operator,4393687
,,,,
13835,Presentation,"Thank you. And I realize you've covered a lot already. Just ed services, just following up on the decline in marketing costs. Can you just talk briefly about the profitability curve today for a new partner institution, compared to what maybe that was a couple of years ago? How quickly they get to breakeven and ramp to more mature levels of margins? Thank you.",Daniel Moore,4393687
,,,,
13836,Presentation,,Daniel Moore,4393687
,,,,
13837,Presentation,"Yes. So, every partner is different. Every partner requires a different upfront investment and every partner has a different profile to get to maturity. What I can say is that the relationship between marketing costs and that is a significant relationship, and that our ability to be a much more efficient acquirer of student lead is helping us to make sure that not just we get there faster, but that all of our programs are profitable. As you know we're very attentive to the profitability of our portfolio. So, I won't make specific comments on the times of profitability because it's so variable. But, I will say that our efforts to improve the efficiency of marketing and improve the efficiency of the student journey allows us to get there faster. I mean, that's the point. As you know, Dan, as well as anybody, the upfront marketing investment is a big part of what we invest in when we stand up a new partner, and what we do. So, the more efficient we can be there, better the whole portfolio does, but certainly, the faster we are to profitability and in a new partner.",Brian Napack,4393687

13847,Presentation,"During this past quarter, we realized significant sequential improvements in sales trends from our previous quarter. Retailers are figuring out how to manage through this pandemic and consumers are buying to their adjusted lifestyle needs. Our merchants early on were able to identify the meaningful shift in consumer demand towards casual and comfortable clothing as well as Outdoor active attire. As an agile organization, our personnel are empowered to act quickly to redistribute resources and allocate purchasing dollars, enabling us to have the right inventory at the right time for the right price.",Morris Goldfarb,4393678

13848,Presentation,"The distribution and logistics team have also been working tirelessly behind the scenes. They've done an incredible job keeping our warehouses operational throughout this difficult period of time. We're very fortunate to have an experienced and talented global team at G-III. They proactively met the challenges presented by this pandemic and continue to remain focused as we navigate through this unprecedented time. Even as this situation continues to evolve, we've elevated our position as a key supplier to our retailers and our power brands continue to gain market share.",Morris Goldfarb,4393678
,,,,
13849,Presentation,"Now, let's review the financial results for our third fiscal quarter ended October 31. Net sales for the third quarter were $827 million, down 27% compared to last year's $1.13 billion. Net income per diluted share was $1.29 as compared to $1.97 last year. Our third quarter sales were driven by athleisure the newly launched jeans lines for our three power brands, Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, and DKNY, as well as casual footwear and outerwear. We are tightly managing our inventory levels, which ended the third quarter down 29% compared to last year's third quarter. We remain comfortable with our inventory levels and category composition. Looking at this fiscal fourth quarter, we expect sales to be down approximately 30% compared to last year's fourth quarter.",Morris Goldfarb,4393678

We continue to focus and invest our resources to follow the consumer where they are shopping. To capture a larger portion of these digital sales, we're accelerating our global investments in best talents, systems, quick response distribution networks, as well as new and creative marketing. For the quarter, our digital sales penetration for our department store retailers approached approximately 40% up from last year's approximately 23%. As for our own digital sites, we continue to experience increased demand with comparable sales increase in excess of 40%. In China, our digital business, although in its early stages, more than doubled in the quarter. We're really excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for us in our online business.",Morris Goldfarb,4393678
,,,,
13852,Presentation,"Let's spend a few moments discussing the product categories that drove our sales and results for the quarter. As expected, we saw demand for athleisure accelerated across all our brands. Our replenishment programs continue to present to represent an important sales driver of both in stores and online as we are quickly able to restart product as demand takes shape.",Morris Goldfarb,4393678
,,,,
13853,Presentation,"With three of our power brands, Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and DKNY, we are known for providing some of the best fashion and technical design in athleisure and see that category as a very significant opportunity as we move forward. Our Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, and DKNY jeans collections are focused on casual and comfortable fashion and trust [ph] a wide variety of woven and knit tops and relapsed bottoms, leggings and pants. We expect these lines to contribute to our growth and profitability and feel confident that each of these jeans lines can grow to be a $250 million business. Importantly, these lines have enabled us to become an important player in the denim space in a very short period of time. These businesses also allow us to engage and transact with the younger consumer and further align us with today's casual and active lifestyle.",Morris Goldfarb,4393678
,,,,
13854,Presentation,"Speaking of active lifestyles, in anticipation of the colder weather and the outdoor lifestyle of consumers, we saw a better demand for outerwear this quarter. For the fall and holiday season, our outerwear collections featured expanded offerings of transitional mid-weight styles, featuring puffer jackets and layered pieces consisting of various stretch fabrics as well as wafers. We believe our outerwear business is well positioned and consumers maintain an active lifestyle for the foreseeable future.",Morris Goldfarb,4393678
,,,,
13855,Presentation,"As for sportswear, we again focused on casual offerings for the fall and holiday season. As sportswear collections features some great colors and prints, which show well on digital searches and lend themselves perfectly for gifting. Our product lines feature knit and woven tops and sweaters, as well as casual comfortable dresses and bottoms. Similar to the trends we saw during the second quarter, our DKNY footwear business saw great sales and strong sell-throughs at retail, driven by relaxed styles including canvas, footwear and boots. We're also seeing strength in our Calvin Klein and DKNY handbag offerings. Here again, our collection is shifted towards softer styles which complement our consumers' new lifestyle.",Morris Goldfarb,4393678
,,,,
13856,Presentation,"Let me touch upon our growth plans for our Karl Lagerfeld Paris business. Now accelerated by the consumers' current demands, we've developed a collection of today's essential fashions that work well with the brands Parisian chic DNA. This spring, we expect to launch Karl Lagerfeld Paris in approximately 75 new Macy's doors. In our retail segment, the closing of all of our G.H. Bass and Wilsons Leather stores is almost complete. As we discussed in the past, operating losses in our retail segment relating to these stores were approximately $50 million last year. We expect the restructuring to eliminate a substantial portion of these losses.",Morris Goldfarb,4393678

Although the stores are still traffic challenged, we've seen good increases in conversion, our product is resonating with the consumers. Based on higher levels of conversion and cleaner inventories, we've been less promotional, resulting in increased AURs.",Morris Goldfarb,4393678
,,,,
13859,Presentation,"Our store teams have also been incredibly innovative working with customers and partnering with influencers to quickly adapt virtual selling techniques to offset traffic headwinds. We are seeing very strong results on our websites for both DKNY and Karl Lagerfeld Paris. Validation at these brands continue to resonate with consumers; we are on a path to profitability for our ongoing retail segment. In addition to the restructuring of our retail operations that we highlighted on our second quarter call, we streamlined our global wholesale headcount. Additionally, this past quarter, we further rationalized that cost base and are now on track to recognize annual savings of roughly $28 million. We're confident our current staffing is appropriately aligned to support our business needs.",Morris Goldfarb,4393678
,,,,
13860,Presentation,"I'd like to take a moment to talk about our international opportunities. Our DKNY International business was down approximately 15% for the quarter and has held up better in spite of the pandemic. We continue to develop new accounts in Europe and the Middle East, a bright spot in China, where we've just increased our ownership from 49% to 75% in our DKNY joint venture. In the third quarter, we saw a month-over-month recovery in comparable sales trends, which culminated in a positive 30% [ph] comp for the month of October.",Morris Goldfarb,4393678
,,,,
13861,Presentation,"As I mentioned earlier, our digital business in China has increased substantially. We see significant opportunity to grow our DKNY business and engage with the local China market with a well-known global brand. We have a talented and experienced management team and great partners to help us achieve this growth. We are successfully navigating through and continues to remain one of the most challenging and fluid retail environments of our time. We feel good about our product assortments and our ability to work collaboratively with our strong vendor base and retailers to successfully design and provide great product. We are well positioned to complete the year in line with our expectations.",Morris Goldfarb,4393678

13862,Presentation,I will now pass the call to Neal for a detailed discussion of our third quarter financial results.,Morris Goldfarb,4393678
,,,,
13863,Presentation,"Thank you, Morris. The results for our third quarter ended October 31, 2020 were significantly impacted by the ongoing effects of the pandemic.",Neal Nackman,4393678
,,,,
13864,Presentation,"Let us begin with the retail segment. The restructuring of our retail operations, which includes the closing of all 110 Wilsons Leather and 89 G.H. Bass stores is going as planned. In connection with this restructuring, we expect to incur aggregate net cost in charges of approximately $100 million. This $100 million operating loss is inclusive of allocated overhead, some of which will remain in order to support the ongoing retail operations. On a year-to-date basis, we have incurred direct four wall costs and charges of approximately $74 million, which exclude any allocations. We have included some relevant breakout data for the four wall retail operations in our earnings release issued this morning.",Neal Nackman,4393678
,,,,
13865,Presentation,"For our third quarter results. Net sales for the third quarter ended October 31, 2020 decreased approximately 27% to $827 million from $1.13 billion in the same period last year. Net sales of our wholesale operations segment decreased approximately 27% to $783 million from $1.07 billion. Net sales of our retail operations segment for the quarter were $58 million approximately 35% lower compared to last year's sales of $90 million. Retail sales included $38 million and $60 million of sales for Wilsons Leather and G.H. Bass stores in the quarter ended October 31, 2020 and 2019 respectively.",Neal Nackman,4393678

13866,Presentation,,Neal Nackman,4393678
,,,,
13867,Presentation,"Our gross margin percentage was 36% in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 as compared to 35.4% in the prior year's period. This increase in gross margin was primarily driven by the gross margin percentage in our wholesale operation segment, which was 35.5% compared to 33.2% in last year's quarter. Wholesale gross margins were positively impacted by the reversal of previously anticipated markdown accruals, that are no longer necessary due to the reduced wholesale sales. The gross margin percentage in our retail operations segment was 33.9% compared to 49.3% in the prior year's quarter and was primarily impacted by store liquidations for Wilsons Leather and G.H. Bass stores. We continue to watch overall our expenses very carefully.",Neal Nackman,4393678
,,,,
13868,Presentation,"SG&A expenses were down 28% to $178 million in this quarter compared to $247 million in the same period last year. We further streamline the headcount in our global wholesale operations, and as a result, we now expect approximately $28 million of annualized savings.",Neal Nackman,4393678
,,,,
13869,Presentation,"Net income for the third quarter was $63 million or $1.29 per diluted share compared to $95 million or $1.97 per diluted share in last year's third quarter. Net income per share in the quarter included a four wall loss of $0.25 for the Wilsons Leather and G.H. Bass store operations. Last year's earnings per share included an $0.08 loss for the Wilsons Leather and G.H. Bass store operations. Net income also includes a non-cash charge of $6.5 million in this quarter, associated with the write-off of deferred financing costs, primarily related to our prior term loan facility, which was refinanced and replaced with bonds in August 2020. The effect of this charge is equal to $0.09 per diluted share in the quarter.",Neal Nackman,4393678
,,,,
13870,Presentation,"Looking at our balance sheet, accounts receivable were $721 million as compared to $899 million at the end of the prior year's quarter.

We ended the third quarter in a very strong net debt position of $359 million as compared to $620 million in the prior year.",Neal Nackman,4393678
,,,,
13871,Presentation,"Our third quarter ended with cash and availability of approximately $800 million. Our current strong liquidity and financial position will enable us to navigate through the current environment. As for our guidance, we continue to expect the COVID-19 pandemic to negatively impact our results in the fourth quarter of the year. Accordingly, we continue to anticipate a decline in net sales of approximately 30% in the fourth quarter as compared to the same period last year. The impact of the pandemic continues to be fluid, making it difficult for us to provide additional guidance for fiscal 2021.",Neal Nackman,4393678

,,,,
13873,Presentation,"Thank you, Neal, and thank you all for joining us today. This quarter was further validation that G-III's entrepreneurial culture built over almost 50 years can weather any challenge put in front of us.

13875,Presentation,"Operator, we're now ready to take some questions.",Morris Goldfarb,4393678
,,,,
13876,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Edward Yruma with KeyBanc. Your line is now open.,Operator,4393678
,,,,
13877,Question-and-Answer,,Operator,4393678
,,,,
13878,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, first of all, a housekeeping question. Some constructive commentary on athleisure and performance, I know you have at across multiple brands. How big is the business today and kind of how should we think about kind of medium-term growth? And then as a follow-up, Morris, I know you're starting to think about kind of second half of '21 vaccine hopefully by then. How are you positioning your business against what could be much stronger apparel demand? Thank you.",Edward Yruma,4393678
,,,,
13879,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you, Ed. Thanks for the questions. This isn't really a topic of athleisure as a category, it's a lifestyle. And athleisure flows into almost everything that we do. There are elements of casual dressing as I spoke to in our sportswear business that emanate from the new consumer way of dressing or the current consumer way of dressing. So our entire product mix reflects what the consumer is looking for today. It's not simply the athleisure category. That said, our athleisure category is a category of size. It's one of our bigger pieces of business. Calvin Klein is the one of -- is our largest piece, followed by Tommy Hilfiger and DKNY, and positioned in department stores, I would say, they could be classified as the largest piece of the department store athleisure offering. So again, it's not -- it's no longer a startup, it's fairly well developed. What is -- addressing what is likely to grow significantly in its second year of offering is the gene business. This is our first year in the gene business, which also reflects a casual lifestyle look, and we penetrated the business aggressively with CK Jeans again followed by Tommy Hilfiger and DKNY and we're beginning to make our mark in the gene business very, very quickly. You'll see us in all the retail venues that we serve. It's not limited to one retailer, it's fairly well distributed. And as I said earlier, we believe those three businesses can individually be $250 million in size.",Morris Goldfarb,4393678
,,,,
13880,Question-and-Answer,"As far as the second half of the year and our calendar '21, there is lots to learn. What we emphasize is that, we are an agile organization. We kind of proved that out just recently. We believe we know where we're going for Q2 in product mix. We're aggressively designing and creating and building collections of product that are suitable for what the consumer is looking for. We have -- we've been under pressure with our social dresses and our dress business this year. They're highly profitable traditionally for us. We've altered the styling and we believe we've corrected the path and even the dress business will be much more casual for the back end of the year, as well as Q1, Q2. So we're addressing it with styling. We have a resource structure globally that supporting all of our needs, and we are intact, we're an aggressive company that figures it out and we've got a talent pool that is very much aligned with home office and does the unimaginable to accomplish the success. So I hope I answered a little bit of what you've asked.",Morris Goldfarb,4393678
,,,,
13881,Question-and-Answer,"Sure, thank you. And maybe one other quick follow-up I might sneak it in. We heard more retailers talk about why to lean on vendors for drop ship inventory. I know you do a little bit of that, but kind of how comprehensive is your infrastructure to support the dotcoms of your retail partners? Thanks.",Edward Yruma,4393678
,,,,
13882,Question-and-Answer,"It is not comprehensive. We do it on a spot-by-spot basis. We are not structured for drop shipping, but we will be. We've hired talent that we're searching for the appropriate real estate. We're putting systems in place to accommodate drop shipping to the direct consumer and taking some of that responsibility away from our department store partners, and as well as in Amazon to some degree. So given the appropriate time and the appropriate investment that we're making, we should become greater in that aspect of the business. It's an essential need, we recognize it and we're all over it. We've staffed for it, and now we're searching for the appropriate distribution center that can accommodate it. Our distribution is, as you know, we started as a coat company, a lot of what we do is product that is shipped hanging, and it's a far cry from what needs to be done to efficiently handle the cost structure that is -- that entails drop shipping to the consumer. But we're on it. Come back to me in a year, and I'll have an answer for you that is a little different than today.",Morris Goldfarb,4393678

13886,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. Our next question comes from Erinn Murphy with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.,Operator,4393678
,,,,
13887,Question-and-Answer,"Great, thanks. Good morning. Morris, it sounds like in the third quarter trend for outerwear were good. Can you just speak a little bit more about what you're seeing and how did outerwear order books end up for the season?",Erinn Murphy,4393678
,,,,
13888,Question-and-Answer,"So, we are -- as you know, we are predominantly a wholesale company, and thus our orders are written before the weather reacts. So our third quarter was good as far as shipping was concerned. Retail in Q3, for most of Q3 in outerwear was good, the tail end of it slowed down, weather didn't cooperate, and the beginning of Q4 is not what we would like it to be. It's acceptable, but weather cures all those ills. The outerwear that we're producing is again the -- or produced is basically a derivative of the outdoor trends that people are looking for. There is -- there has been outdoor eating, people are spending more time in activities outdoors and our outerwear reflects it. We produced an unimaginable amount of filled and unfilled breathable fabrics for the -- for our puffer jackets. Most of them had stretch in them. We have unique fabrics, unique to G-III that have sold incredibly well. And our fake fur business was quite good. Where we lack is where we were born, which was a leather business and some of the wool business that we were successful with years ago that -- that's not in play right now. So it's mostly puffer and stretch fabrics that are driving our business.",Morris Goldfarb,4393678
,,,,
13889,Question-and-Answer,"Got it. And then, maybe just for Neil in the fourth quarter, would you think about sales down 30%? Is some of that just kind of what Morris was just speaking about a slightly slower start to the sell through season this fourth quarter? Just help us think about kind of the wholesale decline that's embedded in the fourth quarter guide?",Erinn Murphy,4393678
,,,,
13890,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, Erinn. When we look at it, we didn't really see a huge decline from what we were anticipating to tell you the truth.",Neal Nackman,4393678
,,,,
13891,Question-and-Answer,Okay.,Erinn Murphy,4393678
,,,,
13892,Question-and-Answer,"I think it was -- what we experienced was actually a stronger Q3, but really not necessarily a weaker Q4 than what we were expecting. And I think Q3 was boosted by the shortfall of inventory at retails, which really helped in terms of our demand needs.",Neal Nackman,4393678
,,,,
13893,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. And then just last question, just on the SG&A front, you guys have been very disciplined this year, and I know there is another $28 million in cost savings that you're in the process of realizing. But how do you think about, as we go into next year, that kind of key areas of reinvestment for some of the savings that you've been able to ensue this year? Thank you.",Erinn Murphy,4393678
,,,,
13894,Question-and-Answer,"Well, look we will have -- we'll have a more normalized year, and yet it's still won't be completely normalized, right. So the big savings that we had this year we furloughed a significant number of people, we are taking pay cuts, we've now taken all the furloughed people back that started at the last month of the third quarter. So we will have that pressure on us in the fourth quarter and we'll have some of that pressure going into next year. Marketing spends, we will start to do slowly as we see business continue to expand. And overall there'll be certainly still a slower business activity in the first half of the year. We get benefits throughout some of the -- throughout some of the SG&A items as a result of that as well. But I think the big pressure spots, when we normalize, we'll be -- and people will be in marketing, and let's not forget that we did have some pretty good pain points this year. We took a very large charge this year for bad debt expense, as a result of bankruptcies. We've taken some inventory reserve. So there'll be some offsets and natural offsets to some of the savings, but that's where the puts and takes that I see going into next year's SG&A.",Neal Nackman,4393678
,,,,
13895,Question-and-Answer,,Neal Nackman,4393678
,,,,
13896,Question-and-Answer,"Erinn, our headcount reduction is north of 400 people in North America, about a dozen people in Europe ultimately, and over 100 people in Southeast Asia. So, collectively there is a headcount reduction that's in place of over 500 people globally. So that's an area that we probably will expand on as we refine our business and we better understand these solutions to prosperity.",Morris Goldfarb,4393678

13898,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you, Erinn.",Morris Goldfarb,4393678
,,,,
13899,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. Our next question comes from Heather Balsky with Bank of America. Your line is now open.,Operator,4393678
,,,,
13900,Question-and-Answer,"Hi, thank you. First question, I'd be curious to hear your perspective of fourth quarter promotional environment, what you're seeing with regards to holiday, what that might need for the fourth quarter? And then as a separate question, just curious with Donna Karan being your remaining retail business, how you're thinking about that in 2021? And especially with some of the real estate opportunities that are opening up with stores closing, other competitors closing?",Heather Balsky,4393678
,,,,
13901,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you, Heather. It's quite strange one might think that this is a highly promotional period because of the pandemic, but quite honestly, we're seeing less promotions than we would have expected. There are retailers that are achieving success by driving bottom line rather than topline. And then there are others that are heavily in undated with inventory that needs to move, because some of it's seasonal. But all-in-all, it's not incredibly promotional out there. It's -- the retailer is garnering acceptable return on their investment and on the inventory; so it's okay. As far as DKNY and the success, the beginning of success at retail, we are left with two primary brands that will expand over time. This is a good time to expand on real estate because the real estate offerings are abundant and they're much more fair than they have been historically at least that we might be able to sign is -- could be a percentage lease with kick-outs. So we're not coupled with 10-year leases that we would have to buy our way out of that we learned our lesson. We paid dearly for real estate mistakes just recently as we're closing Bass and Wilsons. We're not likely to go down that path again.",Morris Goldfarb,4393678
,,,,
13902,Question-and-Answer,"We're fairly aggressive on some of the opportunities that are affording themselves in Europe. We're considering opening in -- on the High Street areas of the U.K. with DKNY. There is great demand for it there. Our stores in -- our store in the U.K. -- we have an outlet center in the U.K., which is our single best store in the world and we have two other stores in Europe that are performing exceptionally well compared to North America. So we are likely to expand in Europe. We cannot expand Karl Lagerfeld in Europe, but we have a joint venture partner that's domiciled in Europe and their region of expansion is the globe other than North America, ours is North America. So we are pursuing retail very, very cautiously and opportunistically. It's got to be a great offering for us to jump in and grab it. Thank you, Heather. Thanks for your question.",Morris Goldfarb,4393678

13903,Question-and-Answer,Thank you.,Heather Balsky,4393678

13904,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Duffy with Stifel. Your line is now open.,Operator,4393678

13905,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you. Good morning, everyone.",Jim Duffy,4393678
,,,,
13906,Question-and-Answer,"Good morning, Jim.",Morris Goldfarb,4393678
,,,,
13907,Question-and-Answer,I want to dig in some on the SG&A line. Can you isolate the four wall SG&A associated with the Wilsons and Bass stores that you expect to eliminate with 199 store closures?,Jim Duffy,4393678
,,,,
13908,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, Jim. If you look at the -- well actually we give you a summary in the press release. I think if you look at the segment information, you will be able to get that better when we come out with the third quarter queue.",Morris Goldfarb,4393678
,,,,
13909,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. But we don't know what the gross margin on the Wilsons and Bass stores were versus the retail segment. So there is not sufficient disclosure to figure that out, Neal.",Jim Duffy,4393678
,,,,
13910,Question-and-Answer,,Jim Duffy,4393678
,,,,
13911,Question-and-Answer,"Let us look at that and see if we want to expand upon that, Jim.",Neal Nackman,4393678
,,,,
13912,Question-and-Answer,"And then, it looks like the retail profitability disclosures year-to-date suggests it maybe you added back some profitability to the Wilsons and Bass stores in Q1 and Q2, because the previous disclosures along with what you have given for the third quarter don't total?",Jim Duffy,4393678
,,,,
13913,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, Jim, the big difference there is the tax rate. We've got a pretty high tax rate and we use the effective tax rates. So if you focus on the pre-tax numbers, you should see a steady increase to the operating losses over the -- over time. There was no add back.",Neal Nackman,4393678
,,,,
13914,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. I'll take a closer look at that. And then, I'm curious within the retail segment, what's the residual component of retail SG&A that will remain in the model for next year, you know that overhead plus the four wall SG&A of the remaining stores?",Jim Duffy,4393678
,,,,
13915,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, I think in terms of -- let me speak a little bit about the trapped overhead. We're thinking that this year we'll probably ran about $20 million of trapped overhead that we will have to continue to absorb. We're thinking that that from a trend line is probably down to about $15 million today, and then we'll continue to look at that and probably hope to make some more improvements in that as we go into next year?",Neal Nackman,4393678
,,,,
13916,Question-and-Answer,"Okay, that's helpful. And then, I guess, building on Erinn's question with the remaining wholesale business, how much of that SG&A savings do you expect to be able to keep, you're mentioning the $28 million annualized savings from the headcount, the run rate SG&A for this year well below that in terms of savings. Just trying to understand how much of that comes back into the model?",Jim Duffy,4393678
,,,,
13917,Question-and-Answer,"So, keep in mind, the other part of our SG&A that does move is certainly the variable portion of it. And so as we have sales, we will have variable lift. That variable lift comes in the form of really advertising that we refer to as national advertising associated with our licensed businesses, and then, of course, our third-party shipping is in our selling and general expense category as well. So those are the two variable expense components that you'll see go up and down with sales for the most part. And then as I mentioned, we'll have increases back on the payroll side and then advertising will be the two main drivers of increase offset by some of these bad debt expenses that we've had in the periods.",Neal Nackman,4393678
,,,,
13918,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. Thanks for the detailed responses. One more for me and then I will move on. But looking back to the wholesale gross margin in fiscal '20 roughly 33%, would you expect to be able to improve on that based on category mix and brand mix as you look out to next year?",Jim Duffy,4393678
,,,,
13919,Question-and-Answer,"No, I think, Jim, that's a pretty good margin for us. And I think that that this year we've gotten benefits in the wholesale gross margin as a result of these markdown reversals. So I think if you went back to the prior fiscal, that's probably where we will start to anniversary our gross margins. And those gross margins are fairly strong. Keep in mind, we've got licensing partners for about 60% of the business. So we operate at a pretty high gross margin when you add that back in, and I think that that's probably where you should think about our anniversarying us going forward.",Neal Nackman,4393678

13920,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. Thanks for all the help, Neal.",Jim Duffy,4393678

,,,,
13924,Question-and-Answer,"Great. Thank you so much. Just wondering if you could give us a little bit more color, on the 4Q you mentioned the sales picking down 30%, but as far as gross margin and SG&A, any puts and takes that we should be thinking about for those line items look into the fourth quarter?",Jay Sole,4393678
,,,,
13925,Question-and-Answer,,Jay Sole,4393678
,,,,
13926,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, I think in terms of gross margin. Keep in mind, we are going to be at the last part of our Wilsons and Bass liquidation, so that will put a little bit of pressure on us. As you can expect, when the liquidations reach their end, you get lower gross margin achievement to get rid of your final product. I think in terms of the SG&A, the only thing to again keep in mind is that we did start the furloughs -- bringing people back from furlough. So we'll have that full impact for us in the fourth quarter as well. So while we did a very good job of really reducing SG&A almost completely in line with our wholesale sit with our total sales drop, we will have some deleverage pressure going into the fourth quarter on SG&A.",Neal Nackman,4393678

,,,,
13929,Question-and-Answer,"Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I wanted to touch a little bit more on the lifestyle or athleisure product that you've rolled out our increase in penetration. I guess I'm curious just relative to the average sales decline of 26%, how is that performing? Did you see any pockets of positive growth or close to positive growth? And then just on the dress side, it sounds like you've definitely casualized those dresses, but I guess are those dresses also down in penetration as a percent of the mix to for the back half? Thanks.",Susan Anderson,4393678
,,,,
13930,Question-and-Answer,"So, I'll hit the second comment first. Our dress business is down for the second half of the year, being calendar '20. Hopefully, we recover for '21. The common belief is the woman's wardrobe drove is getting old and she's going to go out there and aggressively buy dress as soon as she is able to commute to go out and have dinner and socialize with their family and friends. The common belief is the dress business comes back fast and furious. And so -- and we believe that to be the case. As far as performance in athleisure -- in our athleisure areas, they're performing significantly better than any other category that we have. So there is -- we have our Calvin business that is for the last month is comping almost flat to last year. Had we've been prepared with the level of inventories that we needed, we would have comped up. It wasn't about demand. It was more about supply.",Morris Goldfarb,4393678
,,,,
13931,Question-and-Answer,"And for Q4, we believe that it will track in similar form. We're finding that take all three power brands, DKNY, CK and Tommy and compare the active lifestyle piece to the rest of the company, we're tracking at missing by high-teens for the quarter comp to the 27% as comprehensive category mix.",Morris Goldfarb,4393678

13932,Question-and-Answer,"Great, that's very helpful. And then, I'm curious, just for spring 2021, what you're seeing in terms of orders from your wholesale partners, I guess, particularly department stores, are you seeing any improvement at all from the second half?",Susan Anderson,4393678
,,,,
13933,Question-and-Answer,Yes. We will see improvement. I would tell you that the order book looks like it's down about 20% in the -- for the spring book and we're comfortable if that will show improvements certainly to the -- to this fiscal year and that's the type of sequential improvements that we would hope to continue to see as the year rolls out.,Neal Nackman,4393678
,,,,
13934,Question-and-Answer,"Great, that's helpful. And then lastly, I just curious how you're thinking about the promotional environment for fourth quarter and over holiday, I guess, relative to last year, and then also what you saw on third quarter, which I guess sounded pretty tight, especially given for those products that were in high demand?",Susan Anderson,4393678
,,,,
13935,Question-and-Answer,"I guess it all depends on the effect of the pandemic. Clearly, we are all aware of the spike up that's occurred, which results in store closures. It extends the period of time that tourism is back in our world. So it's a hard one to forecast as far as the promotional level. There is a period of time, there is intense, and then there is reality. The intent is not to be highly promotional, but reality is. If there is no traffic and there is a need to create liquidity, the retailer will become highly promotional. We've seen it before and we'll see it again. So it's a hard one to forecast. It's not based on fashion, it's probably not based so much on weather as it is the consumer desire to go out and shop and her ability to get everything she might want on the digital side of the world. That clearly has had an impact, but it doesn't cure all of it. So again a little complicated of an answer. It's not a cut-and-dried one, but it's best that I can do for the moment.",Morris Goldfarb,4393678
,,,,
13936,Question-and-Answer,,Morris Goldfarb,4393678
,,,,
13937,Question-and-Answer,"Okay, great. Thanks so much for all the details, and good luck this holiday.",Susan Anderson,4393678
,,,,
13938,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you, Susan. Thanks for your questions.",Morris Goldfarb,4393678
,,,,
13939,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Marotta with C.L. King & Associates. Your line is now open.,Operator,4393678
,,,,
13940,Question-and-Answer,"Good morning, Morris and Neal. You mentioned digital penetration within the department store channel in the third quarter was 40%, that's up from 24% last year with the exception of increasing drop ship capabilities. How else can you support that department store digital effort?",Steve Marotta,4393678
,,,,
13941,Question-and-Answer,"We can support it by having replenishment inventory. This was kind of a chase [ph] year, but if it's a go-forward model, our responsibility in the mix will probably be to -- hold on to replenishment inventory, which is not something we would love to do, but it's in necessary evil or for our way of doing business. And marketing, which we're spending a good deal of money on both collaboratively with our retailers and independent of our retailers will help drive that digital business. So those are probably the solutions that I have for a greater penetration on the digital side of our business. And further to that, internationally, we are having success in the Middle East. We're having some successes in -- although early stage for us, we're having good deal of success in China and we believe we can grow those businesses in those areas of the world where they do hit the charts in coming years. So the expansion of the globe would be another element of further success in digital.",Morris Goldfarb,4393678
,,,,
13942,Question-and-Answer,Helpful. Thank you.,Steve Marotta,4393678
,,,,
13943,Question-and-Answer,Thank you.,Morris Goldfarb,4393678
,,,,
13944,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. And our last question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Your line is now open.,Operator,4393678
,,,,
13945,Question-and-Answer,"Good morning, everyone. As you think about shipping and capacity or surcharges and what's happening, where are you on shipping and getting goods when you need it -- for this upcoming holiday season, and going into 2021, any update on manufacturing in China and how you're positioned? Thank you.",Dana Telsey,4393678
,,,,
13946,Question-and-Answer,"Thanks for your question, Dana. Shipping, it depends -- it really depends on the day. If there's a hurricane, we lose a few containers as the container ship topples. If there is a pandemic and the ports are closed, we have backlog. There is high demand for container space and we have been impacted from pretty much every area of the world whether it's Vietnam, Jordan, this week, Bangladesh has got its displacement issues of our freight. So it is a challenge, where we're paying surcharges, we're doing what we need to do or what we -- the best that we can do. We're not in full control, there are times where we're provided with bill of ladings and then we find that the freight was off boarded and is on a 10-day delay. This is a very, very unique year. So shipping is a problem. In spite of it, the third quarter was fairly good. And I believe we can figure out the fourth quarter, but it's not a perfect world. If all the shipping routes and container ships were aligned and we got what we had planned on getting would be a better plan.",Morris Goldfarb,4393678
,,,,
13947,Question-and-Answer,"So -- and as far as our development of product and production in China, we're not really focused on it, quite honestly. It's come down significantly. We're focused on producing in the right countries the appropriate product, we've done a masterful job of bringing down our China production from possibly 85% of this company's production several years ago down to, it's hovering around 30% today. So it's not a test of bringing -- I'm not in politics, quite honestly, unless I have to be. We're in the business of providing products at an appropriate price with appropriate quality, and China has always been a good partner as it relates to that. There are areas that we have figured out that are more competitive than equal in quality and less in duty, and we've gone to those areas, but I'm not on a mission to stay clear of China. I'll stay clear of cotton mills that aren't compliant with what the world expects.",Morris Goldfarb,4393678
,,,,
13948,Question-and-Answer,,Morris Goldfarb,4393678
,,,,
13949,Question-and-Answer,"We are very cautious as to where we produce, how we produce. We've got an office overseas, that's actually based in China, that is clearly focused on making China comply with everything that we asked for. So -- and they do a really good job of it. So again, bottom line, it's not a race to leave China from G-III.",Morris Goldfarb,4393678

,,,,
13959,Presentation,"Thank you, Leanne.",Lawson Whiting,4393663
,,,,
13960,Presentation,"I don't have to tell anyone on this call that 2020 has been a year that no one could have possibly predicted. And when we started fiscal '21 back on May 1st, I did not imagine that I'd be sharing such solid results with you today. Both Brown-Forman and the industry as a whole has been very resilient through what is a very challenging and volatile environment.",Lawson Whiting,4393663
,,,,
13961,Presentation,"First, let me start by thanking our employees. This has been a year of extreme turmoil in all areas of life, no matter who you are or where you live, and we could not deliver these results without your hard work, dedication and agility.",Lawson Whiting,4393663
,,,,
13962,Presentation,"I also want to thank our dedicated long-term shareholders, including all the Brown family members, and our outstanding Board of Directors for your leadership, encouragement, and most of all, your support.",Lawson Whiting,4393663
,,,,
13963,Presentation,"Before Jane and I get into the business discussion, I want to offer a few thoughts as we're less than a month away from closing out Brown-Forman?s 150th anniversary year. I find it interesting that milestones that our Company always seems to come about in turbulent and unforeseen times.",Lawson Whiting,4393663
,,,,
13964,Presentation,"Our 50th anniversary was back in 1920, the year prohibition began in the United States. Back then, we found a way to continue to sell whiskey through medicinal licenses and permits. Our 75th anniversary coincided with the end of World War II. And our 100th anniversary was in 1970, when bourbon began its period of decline and we reinvented ourselves as a consumer goods company and expanded beyond spirits.",Lawson Whiting,4393663
,,,,
13965,Presentation,"And now today, in our 150th year, amidst a global pandemic, we have again found a way to reach more consumers and delivering underlying top-line growth fiscal year-to-date. This year has reaffirmed my long held belief that no matter the circumstances, Brown-Forman will be agile and able to find a way to deliver top tier results. And in this year, full of uncertainties and the unexpected, it's nice to have something that we can rely on. And we do not take that for granted.",Lawson Whiting,4393663
,,,,
13966,Presentation,"So, as I turn to our fiscal '21 results, I want to talk a little bit about some of the surprises in our business. As you can imagine, when we started this fiscal year back in May, the headwinds appeared strong. Bars and restaurants had largely closed worldwide since March, global travel retail had ground to a halt, vacations and travel and hospitality were getting canceled all over the world, and in actuality, most of these headwinds really haven't changed. But I want to share with you a few positive stories of resilience in our business in spite of these headwinds and continued uncertainty.",Lawson Whiting,4393663
,,,,
13967,Presentation,"First is really the overall performance of the spirits industry. I often talk about what a great business premium spirits is with solid growth, nice margins and high returns on capital. And this year is no exception. Since the start of the COVID pandemic, spirits performance, particularly in the United States has accelerated. Overall consumption is up, even with many restaurants and bars closed. And we continue to take share from both, wine and beer. Although that's a trend that has existed in the U.S. for a long time, the gap has gotten wider in spirits? favor.",Lawson Whiting,4393663
,,,,
13968,Presentation,,Lawson Whiting,4393663
,,,,
13969,Presentation,"Another surprise has been the exceptional growth we've experienced in our RTD business. As I mentioned last quarter, we have believed in the ready-to-drink category ever since we launched our first Jack Daniel?s RTD over 25 years ago. But, I'll admit that this year's performance has exceeded our expectations about the format and the category. And this really is not a single brand or single market phenomenon. We've seen strong growth from our Jack Daniel's RTDs and markets like Australia, Germany and the UK. Our recent launch of the Jack Daniel's spirit-based RTDs in the U.S. is off to a terrific start. We've also seen excellent performance from our malt-based Jack Daniel's country cocktails in the U.S. Our tequila-based RTDs called New Mix in Mexico, which is now near a record 8 million cases in the last 12 months. And since our last earnings call, we acquired part time Rangers, a range of low calorie, white spirit-based RTDs as a target investment that we believe will help us grow in this key category.",Lawson Whiting,4393663
,,,,
13970,Presentation,"A little bit on Part Time Rangers. This brand was found by two brothers in New Zealand and offers white spirit-based cocktails in a convenient format. We believe this brand can help diversify our RTD offerings in this region, as well as broaden our reach into the fast-growing white spirit RTD segment. This brand has done very well with a new generation of consumers. And we believe, it?s well-positioned to take advantage of recent consumer trends such as lower calorie, lighter and brighter tasting. Part Time Rangers is also known for its focus on wildlife conservation and sustainability, particularly through its charitable donations supporting conservation and ecosystem preservation. While focused on New Zealand and Australia, over the next 12 months, we believe this brand has the potential to move into more markets in upcoming years.",Lawson Whiting,4393663
,,,,
13971,Presentation,"Although, the shutdown of the on-premise certainly gave a boost to the RTD category, the mega trends of convenience and flavors give us confidence that this category will continue to be a growth driver into the future.",Lawson Whiting,4393663
,,,,
13972,Presentation,"Another pleasant surprise is continued and really accelerated growth of super premium brands. As I shared before, this has been unlike any other recession that we?ve experienced. In the U.S., ultra and super premium spirits are gaining share at faster rates than in the pre-COVID time periods. And thanks to the portfolio reshaping efforts of the past decade, we don?t really have much below the premium price level anymore.",Lawson Whiting,4393663
,,,,
13973,Presentation,"I also want to mention that we believe we are not only playing in the right price segments, we?re also in the right categories really at the right time. I?ve already mentioned RTDs, but our two most important categories are really American whiskey and tequila. In the U.S., both of these categories have seen a significant increase in their pre-COVID growth trends.",Lawson Whiting,4393663
,,,,
13974,Presentation,"And it?s worth highlighting the performance of Woodford Reserve. It has not only sustained its double-digit growth and is growing its market share in the U.S., but also we believe it?s ready for a significant push in the international markets.",Lawson Whiting,4393663
,,,,
13975,Presentation,"On a geographic basis, the strength of the developed markets and sequential improvement in recent months of the emerging markets has been impressive. It?s certainly been a welcome surprise in this dynamic business environment to see such robust growth from our U.S. business. And as we progressed through this pandemic, we?ve seen relatively healthy performance from our large developed markets and much of Western Europe, as well as Australia. I?m also pleased with the improving health in the emerging markets too, which did improve over this past quarter, particularly highlight Poland and Brazil, as Jane is going to talk about in just a couple of minutes.",Lawson Whiting,4393663
,,,,
13976,Presentation,,Lawson Whiting,4393663
,,,,
13977,Presentation,"And lastly, the teams deserve a lot of credit for the delivery of new world-class creative. We signed a deal with our new agency of record, Energy BBDO almost exactly one year ago. And in less than a year, they?ve created beautiful global 360 campaigns for American whiskey brands, Old Forester, Woodford Reserve and Jack Daniel?s, all through a global pandemic and all done remotely. If you haven?t seen these campaigns yet, we?ve included them in our slides today. And you can believe that Brown-Forman employees around the world are planning to Make it Count this holiday season.",Lawson Whiting,4393663
,,,,
13978,Presentation,"So, in summary, while we continue to face uncertainty and disruptions to markets and channels throughout the world, I remain confident that the essentials of our business are strong, and then, as we approach the end of our 150th anniversary, Brown-Forman will enjoy many more milestones to come.",Lawson Whiting,4393663
,,,,
13979,Presentation,"With that I?ll turn the call over to Jane, who will walk us through our second quarter and first half financial results.",Lawson Whiting,4393663
,,,,
13980,Presentation,"Thank you, Lawson, and good morning, everyone.",Jane Morreau,4393663
,,,,
13981,Presentation,"As Lawson said, this year has been full of surprises. Considering all the volatility and uncertainty in the world today, we believe that results we released today are strong. In the first half, both our underlying net sales and operating income are up relative to last year with an acceleration in our top-line growth registered in the quarter. Not surprisingly, many of the items that created noise in our first quarter continue to impact our second quarter, including product innovation launches, notably Jack Daniel?s Tennessee Apple; timing related items, both this year and last year; and of course, COVID-19, resulting impacts that include inventory fluctuations, customer buying pattern changes, and geographic channel size and portfolio mix shifts.",Jane Morreau,4393663
,,,,
13982,Presentation,"Before I discuss our results in more detail, I would like to take you back a year ago. Specifically, as a reminder, in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we launched Jack Daniel?s Tennessee Apple in the United States, and sustained our double-digit underlying net sales growth from our premium bourbon and tequila portfolios. While no one could have envisioned the world as it is today, and of course, COVID-19 has created challenges and uncertainty, but also opportunities. We believe this is evidenced by the continuation of our stronger than expected performance this second quarter.",Jane Morreau,4393663
,,,,
13983,Presentation,"With that as a backdrop, let?s now turn our attention to the second quarter and first half performance where familiar trends continue to produce solid results. Starting with our top-line, compared to the first half of last year, reported net sales were down modestly, as a result of the decrease in distributor inventory levels that were built in the United States in April and the negative effect of a stronger U.S. dollar. Adjusting for these factors, our underlying net sales grew 4%. As we look broadly across our geographic clusters, we saw a wide range of top-line performance with either strong growth or generally double-digit declines.",Jane Morreau,4393663
,,,,
13984,Presentation,"We experienced top-line growth in approximately 85% of our markets through the first half, driven by a number of factors, including our well-positioned portfolio, premiumization trends, our innovation, and externally, the impact that government stimulus packages had in a number of markets on the economy.",Jane Morreau,4393663
,,,,
13985,Presentation,"The markets where we are experiencing significant declines appear to have been impacted by a variety of factors, such as down-trading due to economic conditions, heavy on-premise exposure and for us in markets such as Spain and Czechia, declines in tourism, of course in travel retail, but also in Southeast Asia as an example and then the external factors lacking here was the lack of stimulus from the government in many of these markets.",Jane Morreau,4393663
,,,,
13986,Presentation,,Jane Morreau,4393663
,,,,
13987,Presentation,"Starting with our U.S. business, which represents approximately half our net sales, we sustain our strong first quarter underlying net sales performance in the quarter, despite lapping last year?s launch of Jack Daniel?s Tennessee Apple as our year-to-date underlying net sales grew 9%.This strong growth reflects many of the same things we discussed in the first quarter.",Jane Morreau,4393663
,,,,
13988,Presentation,"First, the strength in the off-premise. The channel shifts since the pandemic began has remained significant with off-premise volumetric growth more than offsetting the on-premise declines. Our portfolio continues to benefit from being well-positioned in growing categories and to meet the needs of our consumers during this environment at-home consumption. Most notably, the consumers? desire for convenience, portability and variety, as well as ease of flexibility is being met by the Jack Daniel?s RTDs, Jack Daniel?s flavors and our portfolio of tequilas.",Jane Morreau,4393663
,,,,
13989,Presentation,"Of note, Jack Daniel?s Country Cocktails again delivered exceptional performance, more than doubling volume, both in the quarter and on a year-to-date basis compared to last year. Separately, the shift to at-home consumption, convenience and the desire for contactless commerce has propelled our portfolio?s explosive growth in the ecommerce channel with continued triple-digit trends compared to pre-COVID levels. And as consumers seek everyday luxury, premiumization continues to favor our super premium portfolio, particularly Woodford Reserve and our craft series expressions of Old Forester is these brand families sustain their double-digit underlying net sales growth.",Jane Morreau,4393663
,,,,
13990,Presentation,"Our developed markets grew underlying net sales in the high-single-digits for the second quarter, and 10% through the first half. Continued growing demand for Jack Daniel?s RTDs, most notably in Australia and Germany, benefiting from the consumers? desire for convenience and the launch of Jack Daniel?s Tennessee Apple drove these gains.",Jane Morreau,4393663
,,,,
13991,Presentation,"We remain pleased with the launch of Jack Daniel?s Tennessee Apple internationally, where we continue to see the rate of sales equal to or greater than the Honey post launch greater [ph] sales. Our emerging markets collectively reversed their first quarter declines, growing underlying net sales low single digits for the second quarter and lifting the underlying net sales to flat year-to-date.",Jane Morreau,4393663
,,,,
13992,Presentation,"Poland and Brazil have been resilient in the first half. And while Mexico declined in the quarter, its underlying net sales have grown year-to-date, driven by the exceptional performance of the New Mix RTD business in the first quarter, benefiting from the temporary interruption experienced in the country?s beer supply chain. While the New Mix business remains healthy, we continue to see evidence of consumer trade down into tequila and whiskey categories in Mexico and several other emerging markets. The rest of our emerging markets collectively remain down year-to-date, most notably Southeast Asia, Russia, India, and Latin America.",Jane Morreau,4393663
,,,,
13993,Presentation,"Finally, our travel retail business continued to be the most significantly affected with international airline travel declining almost 90% and nearly all the cruise industry remained shut down. Well, we saw a slight improvement in the second quarter as our military channel is performing well, our travel retail business excluding this channel continued to experience net sales declines well over 60% for the first half of the fiscal year.",Jane Morreau,4393663
,,,,
13994,Presentation,"Turning to our largest brand for a moment, Jack Daniel?s Tennessee Whiskey, overall, through the first half, the brand?s volumes remained down with essentially flat volumes in both the U.S. and our developed international markets and declines in emerging markets. So, the rate of the declines improved somewhat in the second quarter, and declines in the travel retail channel.",Jane Morreau,4393663
,,,,
13995,Presentation,,Jane Morreau,4393663
,,,,
13996,Presentation,"The shift from on-premise to off-premise consumption in our developed markets continues to drag down Jack Daniel?s Tennessee Whiskey?s underlying net sales year-to-date. However, we believe the brand remains quite healthy and is gaining share in the majority of its top 10 markets.",Jane Morreau,4393663
,,,,
13997,Presentation,"Now, turning to our gross margin. Our gross margin declined 350 basis points through the first half, resulting in our underlying gross profit dropping 1%. Higher input costs related to agave and wood, as well as a reduction in fixed cost absorption due to lower Jack Daniel?s Tennessee Whiskey volumes represented nearly two-thirds of our gross margin decline. Channel and portfolio mix shift essentially drove the remainder of the margin drop.",Jane Morreau,4393663
,,,,
13998,Presentation,"Moving to brand expense. While our advertising spend was down for the quarter, reflecting the reduction in on-premise activations and the cancellation of various events and sponsorships, we did see this current flow compared to the first quarter as our investments, most notably behind our news, Jack Daniel?s Make it Count campaign began in October. We continue to expect our advertising investment to accelerate over the balance of the fiscal year. Our underlying SG&A investments remained down in the quarter, reflecting tight management of discretionary spending, such as travel and hiring freezes.",Jane Morreau,4393663
,,,,
13999,Presentation,"And finally, to our fiscal 2021 outlook. As we look ahead, a high level uncertainty continues to exist, including the impact of the current surge in COVID-19 cases and resulting restrictions, as well as the impact this may have on our consumer demand, notably during the critical holiday season that is upon us, and the tapering off of government financial stimulus in a number of countries, barring no changes between now and the end of the calendar year, and the potential effect on the global economy, employment and overall recovery.",Jane Morreau,4393663
,,,,
14000,Presentation,"As a result of this uncertainty and volatility that we expect to persist over the months to come, ware not providing quantitative guidance for fiscal 2021 at this time. With that being said, and more qualitatively speaking, as we think about our broad geographic clusters, first, our developed markets. While we expect the volatility and uncertainty to remain high for the foreseeable future, as we experienced the second round of lockdowns related to the pandemic and have noted slowdown in our November early results, in Europe, we remain optimistic given the resiliency and strength of performance during COVID to-date.",Jane Morreau,4393663
,,,,
14001,Presentation,"Travel retail, we do not expect our business to recover this year in this channel, and will remain down significantly. We expect many of our emerging markets will remain subdued though we anticipate to benefit from easy comps when we begin to lap the start of the pandemic in our fourth quarter. Our non-branded business dominated by the sales of used barrels is expected to continue to be a drag on our top-line performance this year, as it was in the first half, reflecting the expectation of lower volumes and pricing.",Jane Morreau,4393663
,,,,
14002,Presentation,"Our gross margin will remain under pressure for the year, driven by the expectation of higher input costs and mix shifts. However, where our gross margin ultimately lands will depend not only on the volumes of our business, but the mix of our business geographically by portfolio, channel, and size.",Jane Morreau,4393663
,,,,
14003,Presentation,"Regarding operating investments, we believe we are well positioned to invest effectively. We expect our unusually high operating expense leverage in the first half to significantly reverse in the second half, reflecting a notable increase in broad reach media spend as we are investing more into the important holiday period and the recently launched Jack Daniel?s Make it Count campaign. ",Jane Morreau,4393663
,,,,
14004,Presentation,"As it relates to our effective tax rate for the full year, we still expect our all-in tax rate to be in the range of 17% to 19%. Our balance sheet and cash flows remain strong and our capital allocation strategy is unchanged.",Jane Morreau,4393663
,,,,
14005,Presentation,,Jane Morreau,4393663
,,,,
14006,Presentation,"Now, with that, I?d pause and just mention a few recent actions in this arena. As you know, our first priority is to invest fully behind our business. Our Board recently approved an investment of $125 million in capital to expand our bourbon making capacity in Kentucky to meet the anticipated future consumer demand of our brands. We also announced a couple of weeks ago an increase in our annual regular dividend, marking the 37th consecutive year of increases and the 76-year of paying quarterly dividends in our 150-year history. We continue to actively evaluate our portfolio, selling the Early Times Canadian Mist and Collingwood brands, and as Lawson mentioned, acquiring the ready-to-drink brand, Part Time Rangers.",Jane Morreau,4393663
,,,,
14007,Presentation,"In summary, while there have been a number of challenges and headwinds in the first six months of our year, we believe our results reflect our agility and resilience to adapt and seize the opportunities in this very volatile and uncertain environment. As the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on the global economy continues to evolve, we will continue to manage, as we always have, putting our people first and staying focused on the long term. As Lawson mentioned, in our 150-year history, we have experienced many turbulent and unforeseen events and have emerged from those times stronger and with healthier brands.",Jane Morreau,4393663
,,,,
14008,Presentation,"And with that, this concludes our prepared remarks. Let?s open the lines to questions.",Jane Morreau,4393663
,,,,
14009,Question-and-Answer,[Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.,Operator,4393663
,,,,
14010,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, great. Thanks. Good morning. Hey. So, I guess, maybe we could start on the A&P, if I could. I?m curious as to -- with the lower spending in the first half, just what that implies about your share of voice year-to-date. And then, how you anticipate that share of voice to trend as you ramp the broad reach investments that you called out in second half.",Steve Powers,4393663
,,,,
14011,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. I can start off. With the phasing of the spend, I mean, really what you saw -- and just as a reminder, we were down significantly in the first quarter, and it was really more driven by when the pandemic hit and us taking a pause in our spend, so that we can evaluate and reflect where we wanted to spend the type of spending that we wanted to have to take place. And so, that continued a bit into the second quarter, though, I will say that it?s always more important to step back and go back then and if you will and understand that we were spending and did increase our spending in places where the momentum was going. So, behind U.S. Woodford Reserve and Old Forester, behind our RTDs, behind our flavors, so all the things that you have seen drag on our growth in the quarter, we spent behind and have spent behind year-to-date.",Jane Morreau,4393663
,,,,
14012,Question-and-Answer,"What we did though was pull back a bit, as I said in the first quarter, rightfully so for the COVID environment, because of the restrictions on the on-premise channel, which took activities out of that as well as sponsorship events and things. And we said, let?s take the money there and reallocate it to broad reach media and focus it when the news campaign that Lawson mentioned earlier, came out -- or comes out, and that?s really behind Jack Daniel?s and the Make it Count campaign. And it really just started in the October period, really late October. And so, you didn?t see a lot of that, but you?re going to see a heavy concentration, when we think about the phasing of it, we wanted to be there for the holidays, there are a lot of spendings focused in the holiday period where we think we?ll have nice share of voice. And from then on, when you compare our spend relative to our prior year, in the fourth quarter where we were down because again COVID related.",Jane Morreau,4393663
,,,,
14013,Question-and-Answer,,Jane Morreau,4393663
,,,,
14014,Question-and-Answer,"So, I?ll let Lawson pick up on share of voice or anything you want to touch upon that?",Jane Morreau,4393663
,,,,
14015,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. The only thing to add to that is that share of voice, at least I think in our general opinion, it?s getting to be less and less relevant as a metric to use because the explosion in the spending in the world of digital and social media. So, while I do think our share of voice will be going up markedly over the next few months, I?d just be a little cautious on using that as a real strong metric because of the different ways that people are spending. And it seems that she?s right. We were - I know the teams were very excited to get these new campaigns out there, and there was just a bit of a bias to wait until we had that. And so, for the most part, Jack is ready now, Woodford has been out now for a few months, you?re going to see more from Old Forester and more on our tequilas in the very near future. And so, you?ll be seeing more of our brands on air, starting that.",Lawson Whiting,4393663
,,,,
14016,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. That?s great. And maybe a follow-up on that question A&P, and then a different bucket of investments, I?m curious about. On the A&P, when I look back, it?s hard to guess -- to figure out what the right benchmark is. But, a decade ago, A&P was running about in mid teens as a percentage of sales. Clearly, first half, we?re down below 10%. I guess, when you think about the normal -- what normalization looks like as we emerge, how should investors be thinking about the right level of spending for your business as is currently scaled? And then -- that?s, I guess, the follow-up. And the second bucket is, it didn?t come up in your prepared remarks, but obviously ecommerce has been making great inroads across the market, but in your categories, specifically. I?m just curious as to how you?ve pivoted to step up your investments there, and whether you think you?re keeping pace with the change, you?re effectively ahead? Just what your level of readiness is for the ecommerce channel as it looks in the future?",Steve Powers,4393663
,,,,
14017,Question-and-Answer,"Let me take the first part of the question and Lawson can build on that. But something that we tried to target each year, certainly at this point in time in the world, diverge from that. We try to target our spending in line with our revenue growth. And so, you wouldn?t see -- I think what you?re seeing in the first half is just what I explained earlier in my commentary, which was the timing, the phasing, how COVID hit, how events hit. But again, and that?s why it was so dramatic in the first half relative to our top-line growth just being, but it is something that we long-term want to spend in line with our sales growth.",Jane Morreau,4393663
,,,,
14018,Question-and-Answer,"I hear what you?re saying, you?re looking back a decade ago, there?s a lot to put and takes in there. You got to look at pullout effects, brands that have come and gone and things of that nature. And we also look at the spending that we did, not just in the A&P line item. We?ve talked about this before, I know on calls. We look at all our line items in the P&L. So, our packaging costs will show up in cost of goods -- that shows up in cost of goods, our promotional activity, which are a net reduction to our sales price, and then, of course, our people who build the brands. And so, we look at it holistically like that as opposed to just one line item. But again, I would say, our ambitions are to, again, spend in line with our growth and revenues on an ongoing sustained basis.",Jane Morreau,4393663
,,,,
14019,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. But, 10% number you quoted from the first half, you can kind of throw that out. Because we will be building back up as we?ve said here in the second half of the year, pretty strongly. As far as the ecommerce, I mean, I think, we, like a lot of others, see the opportunity here. I mean, that?s -- everybody is seeing that. But, we have industry estimates that say that in the next three, four, five years, you?re going to see as much as 10% of global sales going through e-commerce. And it?s only a 2% today.",Lawson Whiting,4393663
,,,,
14020,Question-and-Answer,,Lawson Whiting,4393663
,,,,
14021,Question-and-Answer,"So, you?re going to see an explosion there, and we?re obviously going to be a part of that. But, it is small. In the U.S., it?s sort of 1%, right now, 1%, 1.5%. But, we?ve added a lot of investment there and we will be adding more over the next say, six months or so. And so, we?ve got a number of ideas and things that we?re going to do there and we?re reallocating resources pretty much like you would expect we would to make sure that we?re there for that channel. But, it?s not only U.S., in fact, it?s bigger than in many markets outside of the U.S., I mean, China being the most well known, but UK, Germany, France, Australia, Brazil, Mexico, it?s all those markets are seeing exploding ecommerce growth, and we?re making sure that we?re going to be a part of it.",Lawson Whiting,4393663
,,,,
14022,Question-and-Answer,The next question will come from Sean King with UBS. Please go ahead.,Operator,4393663
,,,,
14023,Question-and-Answer,"I guess, I?d like to understand your outlook on tariffs, given the new administration. And within that, in the event that you saw some retaliatory tariff relief, when you pass that on to consumers in the form of pricing or potentially step up investment or even flow through to the bottom-line?",Sean King,4393663
,,,,
14024,Question-and-Answer,"Okay, my favorite question. Look, tariffs, which now 2.5 years into it, none of us 2.5 years ago thought that we would still be in the situation that we?re in now. And we continue to work hard to try to find ways for the entire industry to get out of this mess. There are -- I mean, I think, compared to say last quarter, when we talked about this certainly some encouraging signs, certainly the new administration that seems to be putting people in place and important sort of economic roles or trade related roles that are more centrist and a little more free trade than what we have seen out of the Trump administration. And so, we have to be a little more optimistic there. And we?ll see. I mean, I do think also -- really both the U.S. and the EU together want more stability in these international relations. They don?t like the chaos either. And so, we don?t know what the Biden administration is going to do. But, we?re trying everything that we can do to influence to make sure that these trade disputes get resolved.",Lawson Whiting,4393663
,,,,
14025,Question-and-Answer,"And so, I hate to -- I am more optimistic I guess. I?ve been optimistic now for two and a half years and still haven?t solved this self. So optimism isn?t getting it done. But, there?s so many people that are getting hurt by these things. And I think, the entire industry is looking at this like, we need to solve both sides of the Atlantic. It?s tough to say at the same time, because they?re two different disputes, but both sides are working to eliminate or get rid of it all together.",Lawson Whiting,4393663
,,,,
14026,Question-and-Answer,"And then, there is Brexit, which is only, what, three weeks away or something like that. And so, I do think the U.S. and UK have been making progress there on trying to find free trade agreements. And so, that one may pop up sooner than that resolution with EU, but net-net getting more positive on the topic.",Lawson Whiting,4393663
,,,,
14027,Question-and-Answer,"And answer to your second part -- just to build on what Lawson said, second part of your question. We don?t have a crystal ball, as he said. We are optimistic -- cautiously optimistic. But, if the tariffs would go away, you?re asking what would we do? Would we drop it to the bottom line? Would we spend? Would we take pricing? We?re evaluating all those things. I think, our bias would be certainly to take some and reinvest it back into the business, look at pricing and all the different variables. So, this is something we hope we can actually implement here if the tariffs go away soon.",Jane Morreau,4393663
,,,,
14028,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. Pricing decisions are largely separate from tariffs. It?s more of the how much are we going to reinvest in the business, and how much is going to drop to the bottom line. And I think, a lot of it depends on when this actually happens, how do you do the UK versus the EU, a lot of things like that. But, it?ll be a balance between the two.",Lawson Whiting,4393663
,,,,
14029,Question-and-Answer,,Lawson Whiting,4393663
,,,,
14030,Question-and-Answer,"Great, it was a very tough question. And I appreciate the answer. Thank you.",Sean King,4393663
,,,,
14031,Question-and-Answer,The next question will come from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please go ahead.,Operator,4393663
,,,,
14032,Question-and-Answer,"Great, thanks. Good morning. You both spoke a lot about marketing and the new Jack Daniel?s campaign and TV. But, I was also curious about building brand equity sort of in the New World, assuming there?s a timeframe for on-premise to completely come back, even post vaccine. And that?s been such a core part of the spirits model, and especially for establishing some of your newer, more premium brands in new markets and new geographies. So, just curious how you?re thinking about that, the demand, brand awareness, creation model and what it looks like, again, with a more limited on-premise footprint, even post-pandemic.",Lauren Lieberman,4393663
,,,,
14033,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. I mean, look, that?s a tough question. Going forward, I do think, first of all, the restaurant business, while slow to come back, it will come back. And we will continue to use that as a nice channel to promote, particularly the smaller brands. And that?s what was working very, very well, pre-COVID, was the brands like Fords and the brands like Fords, and even our GlenDronach and our single malt scotches. So, that model really, really was working well. We?re having to pivot to spend a little bit more time and attention with those folks in the specialty on-premise channel, which is huge -- specialty off-premise channel, sorry, which is still very, very big. And it?s just a matter of focus that seems to be working. You can do that focus in the on-premise, you can do it in the off-premise, but you just need to put time and attention against these smaller brands. And that separating those people?s responsibilities from building a Jack Daniel?s or building a Woodford has worked very, very well in the U.S., and it?s something we?re going to do outside of the U.S. now too. We?re -- it would certainly -- it works better when the on-premise is more vibrant. But, these folks are able to do both channels at the same time and really build these brands. And I think we?ve got enough confidence that that model can work that we are going to continue to focus on it.",Lawson Whiting,4393663
,,,,
14034,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. Just to build on what Lawson said. I think, our model part, as we said, has been in the on-premise. I think, we are also saying and saying is that we know that how brands grow is by awareness. And so, whether the traditional media, which has been going away for some time, in terms of the spend with cutters and so forth like that, and more towards streaming, video streaming online, social and things of that nature, these brands can get awareness through those mechanisms, food, or through those channels. And so, again, we want to be -- reach, we?re trying to reach more consumers regardless of what it is, which brands, whether they?re small or large. So, our brand building model is really focused on reach and being top of mind, if it?s small, and however we might do it. And like I said, I think these smaller brands can play well in the digital space.",Jane Morreau,4393663
,,,,
14035,Question-and-Answer,The next question is from Peter Grom with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.,Operator,4393663
,,,,
14036,Question-and-Answer,"Hey. Good morning, everyone. So, I was hoping to get a little bit more color on the gross margin performance. And I fully understand how the Company is thinking about that line item moving forward. Jane, I know you mentioned that the pressure is expected to continue and visibility on channel and country mix is limited. But, could you maybe help us understand how we should think about raw material inflation in the back half where I would imagine you have a higher degree of visibility? And then, building on that specifically, there seems to be a view from some of your competitors that gather prices have stabilized? Is that something you were also seeing or is the expectation that relief there still doesn?t come until the end of calendar ?21? Thanks.",Peter Grom,4393663
,,,,
14037,Question-and-Answer,,Peter Grom,4393663
,,,,
14038,Question-and-Answer,"Sure. Great question. I think maybe I?ll start off with just what -- where we are year-to-date, and then what we?re forecasting for the rest of the year or are expecting for the rest of the year, and then just pull ourselves back and say what does this look like over the longer term.",Jane Morreau,4393663
,,,,
14039,Question-and-Answer,"So, as you heard me, and you saw in our earnings release this morning, we talked about the 350 basis points of margin erosion. About a third of that is really due to this channel size, portfolio shift mix, and the other two-thirds of it is really due to input costs and fixed costs absorption being less, because of volumes.",Jane Morreau,4393663
,,,,
14040,Question-and-Answer,"Now, the input cost is driven by two components, agave and wood or the cost of making wood. It?s something that we haven?t spent a lot of time talking about in the past, as we?re managing all of us here that our wood costs were laid down four years ago when we were coming through today. And so, the reason why I?m mentioning that is because of some of the things we?re working on today, which will help improve our margins longer term. So, I?ll come back to that in just a moment. So, that?s where we are on a year-to-date basis. Hopefully that first makes sense.",Jane Morreau,4393663
,,,,
14041,Question-and-Answer,"As you said, yes, we said we do still expect margins to be down for the year. We?re forecasting by the end of the year that we won?t -- we will improve from the 350 basis points drag of where we are today. It will improve from there. So, I think we?ve hit our peak, if you will. And so, we expect that to improve where we land, as you often pointed out, Peter, depends upon the mix, the channel mix, the portfolio mix and so forth. But, we do expect some improvement in the back half of the year.",Jane Morreau,4393663
,,,,
14042,Question-and-Answer,"Now, thinking of our future expectations of margin, I think medium to long-term. I started off explaining the wood situation, because, again, what we?re seeing come through the P&L this year is wood that was laid down four, five, six years ago. And so, we?ve got a number of initiatives that we?ve been working on and continue to work on, and will continue to work on that will help improve our cost situation in these type of areas like wood, things that are going into the aging of the barrel. They will not show up this year, they will show up down the road.",Jane Morreau,4393663
,,,,
14043,Question-and-Answer,"Agave, you mentioned agave. We really haven?t changed our outlook on agave from what we explained in the first quarter. Again, just as a reminder, it?s really -- based upon the CRT, plants from 15 and 16, we expected things to -- the situation, the supply-demand imbalance to improve by the end of next -- about a year from now, which is our calendar ?22, so this time next year. We have though, because overall tequila on a worldwide basis, by doing great in the U.S. and growing quite rapidly, it is actually forecasted to be down for the year, actually close down, other parts of the world where it?s really not that big anyhow, but it stands. So, I think, yes, it came out with the forecast of tequilas being down about 4% for the calendar year.",Jane Morreau,4393663
,,,,
14044,Question-and-Answer,"I only mentioned that because we have seen some stabilization in pricing, no change really from our first quarter conversation, which is about 26 to 28 pesos, so still in that range. But, perhaps the pressure on the prices will come down a bit faster we?re hoping than maybe this time next year. But, we?re not seeing a rapid change. We don?t expect it to be all of a sudden drop down to the bottom. But, we do expect to start seeing some benefits starting later next fiscal year for sure.",Jane Morreau,4393663
,,,,
14045,Question-and-Answer,"And then, finally, as one of the previous callers asked was about tariff. And we?re cautiously optimistic that they will resolve successfully and that will also take pressure off of our margins. And so, over the long term, if I?m -- medium to long-term, I?m looking at our margins to improve, not only where it is today, but even from there. We have one final variable that we?ve been working on, which is our pricing, talk about this before, which -- this group, I believe, which is our revenue growth management capabilities.",Jane Morreau,4393663
,,,,
14046,Question-and-Answer,,Jane Morreau,4393663
,,,,
14047,Question-and-Answer,"We?ve invested a lot in tools. We?ve gotten quite sophisticated in our U.S. organization and just recently rolled it out to the rest of our major markets around the road. But, we?re building those capabilities, and what that capabilities allow us to do is to look at optimizing our pricing by channel, by customer, whether our promotions are effective or not effective, where are those opportunities to take pricing and more actively doing that and have actually seen nice benefits from it already in the U.S. and that will help as we go down the road too.",Jane Morreau,4393663
,,,,
14048,Question-and-Answer,"Just a follow-on comment on the tequila category, just because it?s been fascinating to watch. We?ve said and even read a lot of different CPG categories, whatever trends were happening pre-COVID, just accelerated over the last eight or nine months. I don?t think there?s any category where that may be more apparent than Tequila, Cognac seeing a bit of it too, but -- in the U.S. Yes, in the U.S. And the super-premium and ultra-premium brands are on fire. I mean, they?re just growing at rates that are through the roof. And we all say, it?s people like to make a margarita at home. But, I don?t think that many people are buying $60 and $70 bottle of tequila and making margaritas with. I mean, that?s over ice with the lime, drinking it as a cocktail. And if you look at the Nielsen trends or NABCA trends or anything else, I mean vodka, which is a much larger category, for every dollar that tequila is growing, vodka is losing. And the two of them almost offset each other. But, it?s just been a dramatic change in the U.S. spirits business in terms of categories between those two. And as I say, it?s been interesting to watch and obviously is a good thing for us, because we?re very small on the vodka world and much bigger in tequila world, costs aside.",Lawson Whiting,4393663
,,,,
14049,Question-and-Answer,"Peter, if you?re interested in a recipe, our CEO here, Lawson, he just won yesterday for margaritas. We?re trying tonight as this earnings period is over.",Jane Morreau,4393663
,,,,
14050,Question-and-Answer,"I appreciate that. If I just have -- I do have one quick follow-up, Jane, just based on some of those wood initiatives you mentioned. I guess, when can we expect those to begin to show up in the P&L? And I guess, you?d have a lot -- given the aging process here, I mean, when -- for how much longer do you expect wood to be inflationary, given what you laid down four years ago?",Peter Grom,4393663
,,,,
14051,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. So, I think, what we?ve laid down in the barrel is already in the barrel. So, I think, you?re talking about four years down the road, before we start seeing some real benefits. We?re doing some things today that could come through a bit -- it can come through a [Indiscernible] don?t get too technical here, but we?ll get a little bit of that come through in current - in next year, let?s say. ",Jane Morreau,4393663
,,,,
14052,Question-and-Answer,The next question will come from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. ,Operator,4393663
,,,,
14053,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to touch on the divergence that you?re seeing between your volumes and price mix. Definitely understand there are several major drivers here both from a product mix and a channel mix standpoint. But, I guess, it would be helpful if you could provide a little bit more color on the drivers of this. And then, second, can you give us a sense as to when we might expect this divergence to narrow? I guess, I?m wondering, how big of a risk do you guys see that pricing ultimately reverts to lower levels over the long term? Thanks.",Bonnie Herzog,4393663
,,,,
14054,Question-and-Answer,"I assume what you?re referring to is that our volumes were up 15% year-to-date, and that?s really driven by our TV business where we?ve seen explosive growth on our Jack Daniel?s RTD sort of 36%. And our -- and our New Mix business, which is 100% Mexico is up quite nicely as well, benefiting from a first quarter beer disruption in that market. And so, something that we?d like to do is to equalize this on an equivalent basis, and so when you equalize drinks on a volumetric basis, full strength whiskies and full strength tequilas, you?re about at a 1% volumetric growth. Our mix -- and again is really again driven by the portfolio shift, meaning the acceleration in the RTD and the New Mix. We talked about this in our first quarter earnings call that something we?ve read about from time to time is this margin erosion from RTDs, but quite frankly, it?s pretty small in the grand scheme of the margin erosion that we?ve seen, and we want to be there for the consumer, which we are as you can tell by these volumetric trends. We?re meeting the convenience needs, the basic flavorful cocktails, and so forth with it. So, we have and will continue to believe that the small amount of margin erosion resulting from the RTD business is a good thing in this environment, particularly.",Jane Morreau,4393663
,,,,
14055,Question-and-Answer,,Jane Morreau,4393663
,,,,
14056,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. We?ve been having an internal debate quite honestly on how sustainable these growth rates in the RTD world, and are they just COVID driven? Because so many people are home, are they are they something bigger than that? And I do think we call megatrends. But I mean, convenience and flavor fits very well on those. And so, I don?t -- you?re not going to be seeing the triple digit growth rates that we?ve seen in some places, but we feel pretty good that it?s going to stay. The other big one that Jane mentioned in her prepared remarks, but as we all are saying, I mean, that?s obviously very big too, probably bigger than most folks realize as that leader size in the U.S. would be the example versus 175 is just much more profitable. And so, that?ll reverse and be a benefit to the gross margin at some point too.",Lawson Whiting,4393663
,,,,
14057,Question-and-Answer,"So, there?s just a lot going on in terms of mix that all add up, but there are lots and lots of small things. Did we answer your question?",Lawson Whiting,4393663
,,,,
14058,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. That was helpful. But, I mean, if I may just circle back on the pricing lever. And I don?t know how comfortable you guys are talking about that, but I?d love to hear your views over the long term.",Bonnie Herzog,4393663
,,,,
14059,Question-and-Answer,"I mean, I think, we talked about tequila pricing, and that is inching up. It?s not growing by leaps and bounds. But, there?s certainly momentum to take the price up in that. Even our own brands, if you go SKU for SKU as the comparison or apples to apples, there is some small amount of pricing going up now, largely from reduced discounting and the off premise. But, I don?t sense in the industry or even in our own sentiments that when this is over, we?re going to get more aggressive on pricing, or anybody really wants that. And so, I would expect similar to what -- we haven?t had much pricing, it?s been very, very low single digit, but that?s a fair assumption, I think going forward to your long-term.",Lawson Whiting,4393663
,,,,
14060,Question-and-Answer,The next question is from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Please go ahead.,Operator,4393663
,,,,
14061,Question-and-Answer,"Great. Good morning, everyone. Happy holidays. And congrats on the continued progress in the quarter. A couple questions for me, if I may, one on the outlook and then just a follow-up for Jane on cash and capital deployment. So the first one probably for Lawson. Just sort of understanding that we have to get through some volatility here in the winter months, but the broad question, how has your planning changed internally, if at all, as you think about a post vaccine environment over the next 12 months? And then, maybe more immediate term with respect to the guidance, talk about the factors you?d like to see before reinstituting guidance. So, you mentioned some of the challenges in November, we understand there?s going to be some volatility. The flip side is you?re also seeing growth in 85% of your markets. I think collectively, you know the industry across total beverage alcohol has a little bit better sense of what changes in mobility may mean with respect to channel implications and in demand. So, maybe just comment on that. And then, I?ll follow-up on the cash and capital points? Thanks.",Kevin Grundy,4393663
,,,,
14062,Question-and-Answer,"So, look, in terms of how we think about planning for the future and things like that, I wouldn?t -- I mean, I know the brand expense variation between the first half and the second half seems very, very COVID-driven, and it certainly was in Q1, but we?re not really changing our mentality here over the medium or long-term. As Jane said, having brand expense grow in line with sales is a pretty fair way to think about it. And so, even though we -- as I say, the first half hasn?t been that way, that is the sort of the near-term, medium and long-term direction that we look at.",Lawson Whiting,4393663
,,,,
14063,Question-and-Answer,"As far as different, the one thing in the planning world that we?ll see how the next 12 months go is what does the recession look like? I feel, I think we feel pretty good about the United States and sort of the bigger markets in Europe. But, boy, some of the emerging markets of the world, I think are still -- they?re going to be slower coming out of this. And so, how do we reallocate resources to make sure we?re keeping U.S. vibrant, the UK, Germanys of the world without walking away from the emerging markets. But, we?re certainly not going to be investing at the same levels in some of those that continue to struggle in a recessionary environment. And I -- not that I?m an economist, but if you -- certainly the economists that are out there are predicting a pretty rough return for places like India and Africa and pieces of South America, places like that, global travel retails and other one that is likely to be in a pretty subdued trends now for years.",Lawson Whiting,4393663

,,,,
14065,Question-and-Answer,"Got it. That?s all fair. Jane, did you want to make a comment as well?",Kevin Grundy,4393663
,,,,
14066,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. I mean, I could add just a couple of things on to what Lawson said. I guess, reallocation of them has been something we?ve been focusing on for a while in terms of -- to be more effective in our spend. And so, the COVID environment has really accelerated that. So, I don?t know that we?ll go back to pile on a bunch of more expensive spend in on-premise. Yes, we?ll have people there. So, I don?t know -- because you said post-COVID -- and again, it?s a crystal ball, I wish I had but consumer behaviors and what they may look like after that. But I think, our focus will still continue to be on reaching as many consumers we can, and our messaging, and continue with new creative and this new advertising agency.",Jane Morreau,4393663
,,,,
14067,Question-and-Answer,"But, I kind of my take one point that I want to make sure. I haven?t really talked about this, a step and I alluded to it in the script but with the shutdowns in Europe and lockdowns in the Europe happened in late October. So, it really didn?t affect our results. I mentioned in my script that we did see a slowdown in November. Q3 is going to be our toughest quarter, and it was going to be anyhow, it was going to be our toughest quarter, the top-line and then the deleveraging, because we are spending during this ending period. And then, we just swing back with the fourth quarter as we go against easy comps, it?s a top-line and less spending there. So that?s under a little tactical, but I wanted to make sure that I explained that somewhere in this conversation.",Jane Morreau,4393663
,,,,
14068,Question-and-Answer,"We appreciate the color. Quick follow-up and then I?ll pass it on. Cash is growing on the balance sheet. You don?t have any debt coming due. How are you thinking about return of capital above and beyond the normal dividend? The stock is still near all time-highs. The Company does have a history of paying special dividends periodically. Is the thinking you?re going to sort of remain prudent here as long as the guidance is off the table, or do you return to share buybacks and potentially consider a special dividend, given where the balance sheet is and then when cash bounces? I?ll pass it on. Thanks.",Kevin Grundy,4393663
,,,,
14069,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. So, I mean, what we were doing in the net cash position, it is a bit -- this year versus last year, it?s really all the uncertainty, and we did it purposefully. We do have the proceeds from the sale of Canadian, it?s early times in there. We are not planning -- as we always do, as I mentioned earlier, we want to fund our business. First and foremost, nothing?s changed. And we mentioned today $125 million investment we?re going to -- that just was approved by our Board of Directors to spend to expand our bourbon making capacity in Kentucky. So that is something that we?re doing.",Jane Morreau,4393663
,,,,
14070,Question-and-Answer,"Our dividend just went up. But, we do not have any plans for this fiscal year, since there?s too much uncertainty and volatility. We got lots of things coming up. Who knows? While we?re cautiously optimistic the tariffs go away. If tariffs go the other way in June, we haven?t the cash on hand is pretty important to us. And we just really don?t know what?s happening. And so, again, that was purposeful what you?re seeing on our balance sheet, and really the mix of how we?re doing this between our short-term debt and cash. And so, that?s plan for this fiscal year.",Jane Morreau,4393663

14071,Question-and-Answer,"Ladies and gentlemen, we?ve reached the end of the allotted time for the Q&A session. Are there any closing comments from management?",Operator,4393663

14072,Question-and-Answer,"We would just like to thank you, and thank you, Lawson, Jane, and all of you for joining us today for Brown-Forman?s second quarter and first half fiscal of 2021 earnings call.

14075,Presentation,"Good morning. And welcome to the Toll Brothers Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year End Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today?s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.",Operator,4393662

14076,Presentation,"I would now like to turn the conference over to Douglas Yearley, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.",Operator,4393662
,,,,
14077,Presentation,"Thank you, Gary. Welcome. And thank you for joining us. I hope you, your families and colleagues are staying well. With me today are Marty Connor, Chief Financial Officer; Fred Cooper, Senior VP of Finance and Investor Relations; Wendy Marlett, Chief Marketing Officer; and Gregg Ziegler, Senior VP and Treasurer.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14078,Presentation,"Before I start, I ask you to read the statement on forward-looking information on our earnings release and on our website. I caution you that many statements on this call are forward-looking based on assumptions about the economy, world events, housing and financial markets, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and many other factors beyond our control that could significantly affect future results.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14079,Presentation,"Now, let?s begin. I will focus primarily on the current sales environment, and then turn it over to Marty and Greg to address our financial results and our guidance. In these challenging times, our team delivered on all fronts in our fourth quarter, exceeding our expectations for sales, revenues, margins and earnings. I am tremendously proud of how we have adapted to a rapidly changing environment.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14080,Presentation,"We are currently experiencing the strongest housing market I've seen in my 30 years at Toll Brothers, and we continue to increase prices in nearly all of our communities, as we focus on driving profitability and managing growth. The strong demand began for us in mid May and has continued through today.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14081,Presentation,"In our fourth quarter, which ended October 31st, net signed contracts of 3,407 homes and $2.74 billion were the highest totals for any quarter in our history, up 68% in homes and 63% in dollars compared to 1 year ago.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14082,Presentation,"In the first 6 weeks of our quarter through December 6th, our non-binding reservation deposits, which are a precursor to contracts, are up approximately 48% compared to 1 year ago.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14083,Presentation,"Demand has continued to be very strong in the first quarter. In fact, this Saturday, we will raise prices nationwide for the 5th time this calendar year. Layered on top of these national increases are many more frequent community specific price increases.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14084,Presentation,"As we previously announced, midway through our fourth quarter, net signed contracts were up 110%. We strategically moderated the sales pace in the second half of the quarter by increasing prices in nearly all of our communities and limiting lot releases in about 15% to 20% of our communities.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14085,Presentation,"What this means is that, for these communities, we put in place a monthly allocation of homes to sell. We employ this strategy in some of our hottest selling communities, where there is a limited finished lot supply, or extended delivery times due to prior strong sales. Of course, in these communities, we have some of the best pricing power around the country. We've continued this strategy into our first quarter of fiscal 2021.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14086,Presentation,,Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14087,Presentation,"Our 10.8 contracts per community were our highest fourth quarter ever and the highest for any quarter in 15 years. Our cancellation rate for the fourth quarter, fourth quarter cancellations divided by fourth quarter contracts, dropped to 5.4% from 8.9% in last year?s fourth quarter.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14088,Presentation,"Our buyers typically provide a non-refundable down payment of between 7% and 10% of the purchase price, which results in the lowest cancellation rate among the major builders.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14089,Presentation,"In fiscal year 2020s fourth quarter, our traffic to deposit ratio of 9.9%, and our traffic to agreement ratio of 6.7% were our second highest conversion ratios ever. Customers who visited our communities, whether in person or online were intent on buying.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14090,Presentation,"We see strength in every region. Even our city living urban high-rise division, which is focused on Metro New York City, is showing some signs of improvement. We attribute the strength in demand to a number of factors, some of which apply to the homebuilding industry in general and some of which are specific to Toll Brothers and our customers.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14091,Presentation,"We believe the market is on a solid foundation and has significant room to run. Historically, low interest rates are driving the new home market at all price points. We expect low rates to continue for some time.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14092,Presentation,"Additionally, a very tight resale market is leading more people to the new home market. Currently, there is only 2.5 month supply of resale homes on the market, the lowest on record. Resale homes are moving quickly. According to Redfin, in October, a record high 35% of all re-sales nationwide sold above asking price.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14093,Presentation,"Also, there remains significant pent-up demand, due in part to the under production of new homes over the past decade, as well as the impact of many millennials delaying homeownership decisions. We are finally seeing the millennial generation start to transition from renters to homeowners.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14094,Presentation,"Based on the annual average rate of new home production over the past 50 years and the growth in US households, we estimate the industry has under produced nearly 6 million single-family homes since the start of the housing recovery in 2008, that 6 million fewer people that bought a home in the last decade, who would have in prior decades. Even now, production is just reaching historic norms.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14095,Presentation,"In addition to these positive industry trends, there are tailwinds supporting Toll Brothers upscale market segment and build-to-order strategy. Since most of our customers have a home to sell, the tight resale market gives them confidence they can sell their home quickly and at an appreciated value that can then be reinvested in their new home. The job picture for our customer base is solid and improving.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14096,Presentation,"The work-from-home phenomenon is driving demand, as it allows more buyers to live where they want, rather than where their job previously required. Due to this phenomenon, we are seeing an increase in relocation traffic. We also believe our more affluent customer will have greater flexibility to work remotely and is therefore, out in the market looking for their ideal home.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14097,Presentation,"Our build-to-order model is particularly well-suited to this moment, as Americans place more importance on their homes. Our expansive, flexible floor plans provide buyers with more space for living, learning, working and entertaining. Whether it's home offices, fitness rooms, multigenerational living suites or stunning indoor, outdoor living areas, we offer the features that customers desire as they personalize their homes to reflect their lifestyles.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14098,Presentation,"This quarter, our buyers added, on average 22% of the delivered price or $183,000 in upgrades to their homes. So as we look to fiscal year 2021, we believe we are well positioned for growth. With our highest year end backlog in 15 years and continued strong demand, we expect to deliver the most homes in our history in fiscal year '21.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14099,Presentation,,Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14100,Presentation,"In addition, our longer land position is helping fuel growth. We ended fiscal year 2020 with 317 selling communities, and we expect to grow this by approximately 10% by the end of fiscal year 2021.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14101,Presentation,"We also expect our gross margin to improve over the course of the year, as the price increases and strong sales since May are reflected in homes we deliver in the last 3 quarters of the fiscal year and we are very focused on improving ROE. Greg will speak more to this in a moment. In short, we are very pleased with our performance in 2020 and look forward to continued growth in fiscal 2021.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14102,Presentation,Now let me turn it over to Marty.,Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14103,Presentation,"Thanks, Doug. In fiscal year 2020?s fourth quarter, we delivered 2,940 homes and generated revenues of $2.5 billion, which were up 10% in homes and 8.9% in dollars from 1 year ago. The average price of homes delivered was $849,000.",Marty Connor,4393662
,,,,
14104,Presentation,"Delivery total exceeded our guidance, thanks in large part to great execution by our team. In addition, our backlog cancellation rate was lower than anticipated. We delivered many more spec homes than projected, and buyers were more eager than ever to close as soon as possible and move into their new homes.",Marty Connor,4393662
,,,,
14105,Presentation,Fourth quarter net income was $199.3 million or $1.55 per share diluted compared to $202.3 million and $1.41 per share diluted 1 year ago. Our fourth quarter adjusted gross margin was 24% compared to 23.9% in both the fiscal 2020 third quarter and 1 year ago.,Marty Connor,4393662
,,,,
14106,Presentation,"Please note that both current and prior period gross margins and SG&A expense are higher due to a reclassification in sales commissions paid to third party programs, which were previously included in homebuilding cost of sales and are now in SG&A. All historical periods and future projections presented reflect this reclassification. This new treatment is consistent with the way we treat sales commissions paid to our internal sales force and conforms our presentation to that of the majority of our homebuilder peers.",Marty Connor,4393662
,,,,
14107,Presentation,"We have filed an 8-K with the SEC to detail the amount of the classification, but at a high level, it was approximately 2 percentage points of revenue in each of the last 8 quarters.",Marty Connor,4393662
,,,,
14108,Presentation,"SG&A as a percentage of revenues was 9.9% in the quarter compared to 11.1% in the same quarter 1 year ago. Again, both of these amounts reflect the third party broker fee reclassification I just discussed, and are therefore about 2 percentage points higher than they otherwise would have been.",Marty Connor,4393662
,,,,
14109,Presentation,The year-over-year reduction in SG&A is due to our efforts to streamline operations and become more efficient in ways we believe will result in permanent cost savings. We continue to focus on additional steps to further reduce SG&A.,Marty Connor,4393662
,,,,
14110,Presentation,"Joint venture, land sales, and other income was $11.2 million during the fourth quarter compared to $48.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019. Impairments and write-offs totaled $33.9 million in the quarter, $6.8 million of these impairments were from predevelopment costs on proposed projects we control through options that we chose not to purchase, and $18 million was associated with our strategic decision to exit 2 markets.",Marty Connor,4393662
,,,,
14111,Presentation,"Looking forward, we are projecting first quarter fiscal year 2021 deliveries of approximately 1,675 homes, with an average price of between $780,000 and $800, 000. First quarter 2021 delivery guidance reflects our team?s delivery of about 450 more homes than projected in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020.",Marty Connor,4393662
,,,,
14112,Presentation,"In addition, with our build-to-order models, buyers contract for their customized homes, and we deliver those homes 9 to 12 months later. Therefore, deliveries in Q1 2021 will reflect the slow sales environment we experienced in March through mid-May of 2020.",Marty Connor,4393662
,,,,
14113,Presentation,We expect adjusted home sales gross margin in fiscal year 2021s first quarter with deliveries from this slow sales period to be approximately 22.4%. This first quarter adjusted gross margin is expected to be the low point of the year.,Marty Connor,4393662
,,,,
14114,Presentation,,Marty Connor,4393662
,,,,
14115,Presentation,We expect interest and cost of sales to be approximately 2.5%. We expect price increases from contracts signed in our third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2020 positively impact margins over the course of fiscal year 2021. And we expect adjusted home sales gross margin in fiscal year 2021 to grow steadily after the first quarter and be approximately 24.1% for the full fiscal year.,Marty Connor,4393662
,,,,
14116,Presentation,We expect interest in cost of sales for the full year to be approximately 2.5%. We project first quarter SG&A as a percentage of home sales revenues to be approximately 15.8% versus 16.8% 1 year ago.,Marty Connor,4393662
,,,,
14117,Presentation,"Included in first quarter SG&A is about $11 million or 80 basis points of accelerated stock compensation expense that is not expected to recur in the remainder of the year. Again, all of these amounts reflect the reclassification of third-party broker fees from cost of sales to SG&A.",Marty Connor,4393662
,,,,
14118,Presentation,"First quarter other income, income from unconsolidated entities, and land sales gross profit is expected to be approximately $25 million. We project the first quarter tax rate of approximately 26%. Our first quarter weighted average share count is expected to be approximately 129.5 million shares.",Marty Connor,4393662
,,,,
14119,Presentation,"For the full fiscal year 2021, we are projecting new home deliveries of between 9,600 and 10,200 homes with an average price of between $790,000 and $810,000. We expect approximately 60% of our deliveries to occur in our second half of the year, and we expect average delivered price to dip in the second and third quarters due to mix.",Marty Connor,4393662
,,,,
14120,Presentation,"We project fiscal year 2021 SG&A, as a percentage of home sales revenues to be approximately 12.2%. We believe there is significant unrealized profit embedded in our stabilized department projects. We are choosing to defer sales of these assets until markets improve. As a result, fiscal year 2021 other income, income from unconsolidated entities and land sales gross profit is expected to be approximately $65 million versus $51 million in fiscal year 2020, with this concentrated in the first and fourth quarters. We project the full year fiscal ?21 tax rate of approximately 26%. Our weighted average share count for the full year is expected to be approximately 129.5 million shares.",Marty Connor,4393662
,,,,
14121,Presentation,Now let me turn it over to Gregg.,Marty Connor,4393662
,,,,
14122,Presentation,"Thanks, Marty. ROE is improving and should continue to improve over time. We expect to improve our return on beginning equity in fiscal 2021 by approximately 350 basis points compared to fiscal 2020.",Gregg Ziegler,4393662
,,,,
14123,Presentation,"As we seek to drive improvement in our financial metrics, we continue to apply more rigorous underwriting thresholds to new land deals to achieve both a higher gross margin and a higher ROE.",Gregg Ziegler,4393662
,,,,
14124,Presentation,"We are focused on controlling more land through options, land bank arrangements, joint ventures and other strategies. We grew our owned and controlled lots to approximately 63,200 lots at fiscal year end 2020 compared to approximately 59,200 at fiscal year end 2019.",Gregg Ziegler,4393662
,,,,
14125,Presentation,"We spent $603 million in fiscal 2020 on land acquisitions compared to $1.1 billion in fiscal 2019. So in other words, with our more capital efficient land buying strategy, we were able to acquire control of essentially the same number of high quality lots in fiscal 2020, as we did in fiscal 2019, for about half the cash outlay.",Gregg Ziegler,4393662
,,,,
14126,Presentation,We executed land banking transactions in fiscal 2020 that deferred approximately $190 million in land spend. We improved our option to owned land ratio at fourth quarter end to 43% optioned compared to 38% options at fiscal year end 2019.,Gregg Ziegler,4393662
,,,,
14127,Presentation,"We ended our fourth quarter with a very strong balance sheet. We had $3.16 billion of liquidity, including $1.37 billion of cash and $1.79 billion available under our $1.9 billion revolving bank credit facility, which we recently extended out until November 2025.",Gregg Ziegler,4393662
,,,,
14128,Presentation,"We have no significant debt maturities until fiscal year 2022. At fourth quarter end, our net debt-to-capital ratio was 33.3% compared to 32.9% 1 year ago. This relatively flat net debt-to-capital ratio was achieved even while we repurchased approximately $634 million of stock in fiscal 2020.",Gregg Ziegler,4393662
,,,,
14129,Presentation,,Gregg Ziegler,4393662
,,,,
14130,Presentation,"We generated approximately $1 billion in cash flow from operations in fiscal 2020. This was a record. With our strong balance sheet and focus on capital efficiency, we believe we are well positioned to continue growing our business, while also improving borrowing.",Gregg Ziegler,4393662
,,,,
14131,Presentation,"Now, let me turn it back to Doug.",Gregg Ziegler,4393662
,,,,
14132,Presentation,"Thank you, Greg. Before I open it up to questions, I want to thank the entire Toll Brothers team and our trade partners for the results we produced together this quarter and in fiscal 2020. This was a year like no other. To require that we think and operate in new ways, we had to adjust to dramatically changing conditions while maintaining an unwavering focus on providing our customers with a superb quality, value and service they expect and demand from Toll Brothers.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14133,Presentation,"To all of you, you went the extra mile, worked harder than ever before and truly extended yourselves to prove once again why our company is so special. I?d say thank you. And especially to those of you on the front lines who are responsible for selling and building our homes and communities, your resilience and commitment are inspiring.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14134,Presentation,"As we look forward to fiscal year 2021, with our record fourth quarter backlog, continued strong demand, community count growth, improving gross margins and our focus on improving ROE, we are well positioned for growth in fiscal year 2021 and beyond.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14135,Presentation,"Now Gary, let?s open it up for questions.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14136,Question-and-Answer,We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.,Operator,4393662
,,,,
14137,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. Thanks very much, guys. Exciting times. Doug, I was wondering if you could talk about the difference between Toll?s gross margin structure generally today versus let?s say, 15 to 20 years ago, totally ignoring this reclassification issue. It seems to me that there is generally, what, 3 main drivers, right, prevailing home prices, construction efficiency and the value add from the land acquisition.",Stephen Kim,4393662
,,,,
14138,Question-and-Answer,"Let?s take home prices and put them to the side, because everybody can make their own assumptions as what that's going to do. And so, I really want to look at the construction efficiency and land acquisition. I would assume you're building your homes more efficiently than you did in the past, particularly relative to the private guys you compete against.",Stephen Kim,4393662
,,,,
14139,Question-and-Answer,"But on the land acquisition side, I imagine you probably have a little bit more, a little less value add because of the move to affordable luxury and quicker turn land and all that.",Stephen Kim,4393662
,,,,
14140,Question-and-Answer,"So can you help me understand how big of a drag is this move to quicker turning land, net of your better efficiency? I mean, would it be reasonable to think that the net of those two factors is like a drag of maybe a couple of 100 basis points relative to the 10, 15 years ago?",Stephen Kim,4393662
,,,,
14141,Question-and-Answer,"Sure. I?ll do my best, Steve, and it?s a big question. It?s taken me back in time, which I enjoy doing. It?s hard to keep price out of it. I know you asked we keep price out of it because, as you know, back in the early 2000s, there was tremendous pricing power, and we were, obviously, able to drive margins very, very high.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14142,Question-and-Answer,"But on your two points, which are construction efficiency and land act, yes, we are better builders today than we were 15 years ago. This company has matured. There is no question that we bring efficiencies. And I think you are going to see more of them as we are optimizing and rationalizing our home designs to make them much more efficient.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14143,Question-and-Answer,"We?re trying to curate the upgrades that our clients can have, so less is more. It?s less the contract. It allows us to buy trades better when they have 10 or 15 structural changes to a home as opposed to 30 or 40. So we?re spending a lot of time on home design and a rationalization process that is pretty deep into it right now, and we?re starting to see the results of that.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14144,Question-and-Answer,,Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14145,Question-and-Answer,"On the land acquisition side, we are certainly not tying up as many farms in the suburbs of Philadelphia or the suburbs of Washington, D.C., where you pick the market and going through a 3, 4, 5 year approval process and coming out on the back end after the market has appreciated over that time with land that is significantly under market.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14146,Question-and-Answer,"We still do that. That?s part of our mix. But as we have grown geographically into many markets that have land developers that [indiscernible] lots to us and/or maybe the entitlement process isn't as tedious so that you don't have quite the level of gold when you come out the back end as you have in the places that we started this company and we?re bigger, like the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic. I?m sure that has had a bit of a negative effect on the margin because we don?t have as much land development profit that is flowing through.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14147,Question-and-Answer,"With respect to affordable luxury, quite the contrary, the gross margin coming out of affordable luxury the last few quarters is right there with our luxury business. That market has done well. We?re extremely efficient on the construction side for the reasons I gave with rationalizing plans on the affordable luxury. We actually offer less upgrades. I think we?re buying trades even better.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14148,Question-and-Answer,"That market has been strong. We?ve seen significant pricing power. And while we underwrote some of that to a little bit lower gross margin, as we?ve discussed, because it was driving a higher ROE because, in a lot of cases, the affordable luxury land could be purchased just in time. Quite the contrary, the gross margin has outperformed our underwriting and is right there with our luxury business.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14149,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. That's really encouraging. So it doesn?t seem like the headwind or the offset on land is all that great. Great. So given that, I?d like to delve a little bit into your comment about the strongest housing market in 30 years. You and I both go back a ways and certainly that would seem to encompass the period of what we all think of as the housing bubble when times were very good.",Stephen Kim,4393662
,,,,
14150,Question-and-Answer,"I was just - you invoked Redfin [ph] and I was just looking at it, their data which is up 17% in the most recent week, home price is up 17%. And in the last 3 months, that absolutely matches the Apex to the highest level of price appreciation that we saw in the housing bubble.",Stephen Kim,4393662
,,,,
14151,Question-and-Answer,"So when you say that it's a strong, the environment today is stronger than it was, I would assume back then, could you give some commentary that would give us some context or perspective, things that you?re seeing in the marketplace that would lead you to say that even relative to that period of time things are stronger now?",Stephen Kim,4393662
,,,,
14152,Question-and-Answer,"Sure. While Toll Brothers is very different today than we were back then, we have many more markets to look at. We have places like Boise, Idaho, and Jacksonville, Florida, and we?re now in Atlanta doing incredibly well. I?m not going to go waste your time go around the country, you know our business.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14153,Question-and-Answer,"So, I have a much wider lens than I had in ?05. And what I see nationwide, it feels stronger and it feels better, and let?s focus on the better part because by no means was my comment all on the top. I think we have a long runway. This does not resemble the market of 15 years ago.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14154,Question-and-Answer,"Mortgage money is tight. What blew up ?05 and ?06 was very, very loose underwriting. And I?ve told the story of meeting the blackjack dealer in Vegas who owns 3 houses in ?06. And that just can?t happen today. We don?t see investors in the market. And we, obviously, had lots of investors back then.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14155,Question-and-Answer,"There is very low supply of both used and new homes. There is huge pent-up demand, as I mentioned, with 6 million less people buying home in the last 12 years than it appears would have bought in the prior decades going back 15 years. And we have this millennial generation that is now becoming homeowners, that is driving a lot of this activity and low interest rates that we think will be around for a long time.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14156,Question-and-Answer,,Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14157,Question-and-Answer,"So, when I say it?s the best market I?ve seen, it?s because I feel so good about the sustained strength. I am not talking about one moment in time. And you want to compare last week with Redfin?s data with some week in 2005, I am sure they are comparable, Stephen. But I am talking about what I am feeling over the last 6 months. And for all of these reasons, what I think is the sustainability of this market for a longer period of time.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14158,Question-and-Answer,"I do not expect 110% order growth. I do not expect raising price in every other week, but I think we?re entering a period with sustained significant order growth and solid pricing power that has a long runway in front.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14159,Question-and-Answer,"All right. Yeah, I agree. Thanks very much Doug. Appreciate it.",Stephen Kim,4393662
,,,,
14160,Question-and-Answer,Thank you.,Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14161,Question-and-Answer,The next question is from Truman Patterson with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.,Operator,4393662
,,,,
14162,Question-and-Answer,"Hi, good morning, guys. A little bit of feedback on the call. So, first, Doug, I wanted to touch on your orders decelerated from up 110% in the first half of the quarter to up 40. And said you intentionally cap that growth rate in your pricing, limited lot releases, et cetera. I am hoping you can help us triangulate a little bit.",Truman Patterson,4393662
,,,,
14163,Question-and-Answer,"One, what was pricing? What did you push pricing from the beginning of the quarter through the end of the quarter? And you said you limited lot release in about 15% to 20% of the community, what I am trying to understand is how much did your intentional actions create that deceleration versus we?re starting to see a little bit of on demand or not even - but a bit of an organic deceleration. Could you help us triangulate into that?",Truman Patterson,4393662
,,,,
14164,Question-and-Answer,"Sure. The move from 110% that we mentioned mid quarter to the balance of the year was primarily strategic and self-induced by us. We raised prices more significantly as the quarter progressed. And I talked about in 15% to 20% of our communities, we limited the lots that are available.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14165,Question-and-Answer,"And the typical way it works is we?ll give a community, let?s say, 3 lots a month to sell. And when the month begins, we raise the price. And when the month begins, they already have - people they?re working with, because we certainly don't close the sales office by any means. We'll sell those 3 in the first weekend, and then they are shut back down until the next month. And then we do it again at a higher price, and that has helped moderate sales only in that 15% - 15% to 20% of the communities, which tend to be our hot communities, and they may have the biggest backlogs where the next home sold is going to be a very extended delivery. And they may also have less finished lots available where we have to get land development caught up to get more asphalt on the ground. So there is a lot of different reasons why it happens, but that?s the basic premise behind it.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14166,Question-and-Answer,"What I am encouraged by is that I look at these 6 weeks of December where we?ve continued the same strategy, and we mentioned 48% up in deposits. The last couple of weeks - or the last couple of weeks are stronger than the prior couple of weeks.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14167,Question-and-Answer,"So overall, can I tell you, it?s 100% self-induced? Of course, not. We headed into Thanksgiving, and now we?re into December. There has been some sticker shock out there from some clients as we?ve been raising prices. There is no question. But I think it is primarily self-induced. On your question about incentives, we?re up?",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14168,Question-and-Answer,On price increases.,Truman Patterson,4393662
,,,,
14169,Question-and-Answer,"I'm sorry, my apologies, the reverse of incentives look, less incentives, but the price increases?",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14170,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. Truman, we?ve been fortunate so far this year, we've been able to raise prices the calendar year or 1% [ph] price increase that already just announced another one. And so in this most recent quarter, you asked about, yes, we are showing good strength as we look across, if we try to sell approximately the same house, the same house.",Marty Connor,4393662
,,,,
14171,Question-and-Answer,,Marty Connor,4393662
,,,,
14172,Question-and-Answer,"We are showing somewhere in that ballpark of even if we said $20,000. It's not the perfect science because, again, we're looking for ? I?d say the exact houses sold. But if you're looking for a rough ballpark, hopefully, that will give you enough context on how strong the market is.",Marty Connor,4393662
,,,,
14173,Question-and-Answer,Okay.,Truman Patterson,4393662
,,,,
14174,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, go ahead.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14175,Question-and-Answer,"No, no, go ahead, Doug.",Truman Patterson,4393662
,,,,
14176,Question-and-Answer,"I was just going to say that - and it's important to understand that in addition to these nationwide price increases, we are also in most cases, and most of the price increases you see are community-specific, based on local demand, that is the driver of most of the increases. But we are in the market where we have felt comfortable and confident that nationwide, we can take the company up, and we?ll have our fifth one this Saturday.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14177,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. Okay. So 20,000 on generally an $800,000 ASP, so kind of 2% to 3%.",Truman Patterson,4393662
,,,,
14178,Question-and-Answer,That was - that's for the quarter.,Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14179,Question-and-Answer,"Right, right. That's helpful. And your absorptions are up massively, I think, over 70%, right? And you are still reiterating that 350 community count target are up 10% ending 2021. But you are also discussing you know, limiting your lot releases.",Truman Patterson,4393662
,,,,
14180,Question-and-Answer,"As we think about your finished lot constraints, maybe even throw in labor, but also assuming that demand remains extremely robust through 2021. What do you think would be the theoretical upper limit to your order growth, assuming that you could kind of fill everybody that comes in?",Truman Patterson,4393662
,,,,
14181,Question-and-Answer,"We have capacity. Right now, we're selling the low 30 sales per community. Go back to Steve and Kim's time 15 years ago, we were in the mid to high 30s. We?re more efficient. I talked about our plans becoming optimized and easier to build. We?ve come down in price with affordable luxury. We've expanded to geographies that have more trade base.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14182,Question-and-Answer,"So there is absolutely capacity based on the sales environment that is put in front of us. We opened 110 new communities in 2020. Obviously, there was more sell-outs than we expected due to the market. We are projecting - we are projecting to open between 150 and 160 new communities in 2021.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14183,Question-and-Answer,"So I am not worried about improved lots. I am not worried about capacity in the field in most divisions. I think our ability to continue to manage and balance price increases with controlled or manageable growth is our focus right now, and I am proud of how we're dealing with it.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14184,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. That is extremely helpful. And just for clarity, in 2020, I think the average absorption was right around 30% or just a touch over. You think there is no reason, there is no constraints that you couldn't maybe hit mid to high 30s in an absorption rate over the next year or so?",Truman Patterson,4393662
,,,,
14185,Question-and-Answer,That's correct. We've done it before.,Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14186,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you. Appreciate it, guys.",Truman Patterson,4393662
,,,,
14187,Question-and-Answer,"You're very welcome, Truman. Thanks.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14188,Question-and-Answer,The next question is from Alan Ratner with Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.,Operator,4393662
,,,,
14189,Question-and-Answer,"Hey. Guys, good morning. Congrats on the really strong results in this interesting environment we're in today. My first question, I was hoping to dig in on a little bit. Just thinking about that [Technical Difficulty] activity. Curious if you could rank order maybe some of the bottlenecks you're seeing that are leading you to take those actions? Is it more on the land side? And kind of obviously, you're expecting big community count growth through the year. But you don't want to gap out earlier in the year ahead of the spring or is it more on the construction side and making sure that you have some accurate, not only pricing on your cost inputs, but also telling your consumers a realistic delivery date. So I am just curious if you could rank order those bottlenecks for us?",Alan Ratner,4393662
,,,,
14190,Question-and-Answer,,Alan Ratner,4393662
,,,,
14191,Question-and-Answer,"Alan, if you could repeat the first half of your question, it list out there.",Marty Connor,4393662
,,,,
14192,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. Sure. So Marty, what I was asking about was when you think about those 15% to 20% of communities where you're intentionally slowing things down.",Alan Ratner,4393662
,,,,
14193,Question-and-Answer,Okay ,Marty Connor,4393662
,,,,
14194,Question-and-Answer,"I was hoping you could kind of rank order what the bottlenecks are that's causing you to take those actions? Is it land? Is it construction, both?",Alan Ratner,4393662
,,,,
14195,Question-and-Answer,"It is, I would say, number one is the length, the size of the backlog that is leading to the delivery date on the next home sold being so far out that we need to bring it back. So if we are been so hot in a community to have a backlog that is so big, where the next home sold is getting a quoted delivery date of 12, 13, 14 months, even if it's a big complicated house, we would rather get that down at that community to 10, 11 months. And that means raising the price, slowing the sales until we get a little bit caught up where we can open things back up. That's number one.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14196,Question-and-Answer,"Number two would be the sales have led us to get out ahead of land development. And while we may have plenty of lots remaining in a community, we need to get the roads in so that we have enough inventory of roads to build houses.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14197,Question-and-Answer,"We don't like selling a home if there is not a street in front of that lot, because that adds one more wrinkle, where, not only you just have to build the house for the client, but you have to get their road in for them before you can start building the house.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14198,Question-and-Answer,And there is weather delays and permitting issues or whatever else can be thrown at land development where that adds a layer of risk as to when we can really deliver that home if it's being sold without a road.,Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14199,Question-and-Answer,"So we - and that's in limited cases. Remember, the entire extent of this concept of lot allocation is 15% to 20%, most of that is driven by long backlogs, a lesser amount of that is being driven by land development needing to catch up because of faster sales.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14200,Question-and-Answer,"Got it. Okay. That's helpful, Doug. And I guess, kind of transitioning a little bit, but somewhat related. One of the pillars or one of the legs that you were kind of highlighting in the past as an opportunity to improve your returns is, obviously, inventory turnover and improving cycle times. And I think the move to affordable luxury. The idea there was that, that over time could bring your company-wide cycle times lower. Obviously, the environment from a labor perspective probably is a headwind near term.",Alan Ratner,4393662
,,,,
14201,Question-and-Answer,"So how are you thinking about ROE you mentioned improving a 300 plus basis points. But are buybacks back on the table, are there other things you could do, recognizing that, perhaps, cycle times is moving in the wrong direction. Are there other things you could do to maybe accelerate that return even more so in the near term?",Alan Ratner,4393662
,,,,
14202,Question-and-Answer,"Sure. So even in this tough market with trades being stressed and the issues that we all hear about with some materials like washing machines or windows, we're down one week in delivery in cycle time to build a home in Q3 to Q4. And affordable luxury is a bit more than 30 days faster construction cycle than our traditional luxury.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14203,Question-and-Answer,"And I am not only committed, of course, I am committed, it's my job, but I am seeing through our operations teams, and we proved some of this, this last quarter with our tremendous results, real strength in production. And part of it is the affordable luxury line. We brought in some new builders that come from that background, that come from more production builders. Part of it is, is rationalization and optimization and curating of our plans, where less is more and the houses are simpler with less upgrades.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14204,Question-and-Answer,"So we are headed in the right direction. Now there will be some headwinds with the labor issues that are going to come to the industry. But I am really pleased with not only how affordable luxury is proving to be significantly shorter, but how our core business in itself is coming down also.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14205,Question-and-Answer,,Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14206,Question-and-Answer,"Other initiatives along that line, Alan, include putting more land under option, so we can buy it just when we need it, getting some seller financing doing some land banking. Again, that gets us to land just when we need it. And in a few instances, doing some joint ventures to develop the land often with other fellow partners.",Marty Connor,4393662
,,,,
14207,Question-and-Answer,"And, Marty, I am just curious buybacks, if you want to make a comment on that since that has been a pretty big driver in the past.",Alan Ratner,4393662
,,,,
14208,Question-and-Answer,"We're very pleased with our liquidity position right now. It gives us significant flexibility. Certainly, buybacks, debt pay downs and dividends are all the table or dividend increases all along the table. But our primary objective is to grow the company through land acquisitions, just in time if we can, and build our acquisitions.",Marty Connor,4393662
,,,,
14209,Question-and-Answer,"Understood. Thanks a lot, guys. Good luck.",Alan Ratner,4393662
,,,,
14210,Question-and-Answer,The next question is from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.,Operator,4393662
,,,,
14211,Question-and-Answer,"Thanks. Good morning, everyone. And congrats on the results.",Michael Rehaut,4393662
,,,,
14212,Question-and-Answer,"Thanks, Michael.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14213,Question-and-Answer,First question I had was just kind of circling back to your comments around pricing and gross margins and obviously very encouraging around the price increases that you're able to execute right now.,Michael Rehaut,4393662
,,,,
14214,Question-and-Answer,"I just wanted to make sure I understood properly some of the comments you made there. You talked about basically [Technical Difficulty] of $800,000, that would ? you're talking about little over $30,000, as well as many on a community level as well. At the same time, you're talking about $20,000 higher for the quarter.",Michael Rehaut,4393662
,,,,
14215,Question-and-Answer,"Am I to think about it right that, perhaps, one or two of those occurred outside of fiscal fourth quarter? And those are the price increases that should show up in back half ?21 margins, which here kind of back into ? we see like maybe up about 150 year-over-year. Is that the right way to think about the required permits?",Michael Rehaut,4393662
,,,,
14216,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. Several of those five, there have been 5 price increases this calendar year. In fact, all of them, no, there was one in the fourth quarter. Now there is one in the first quarter, and the other ones occurred, one occurred in January when the market was hot. So the other ones have occurred before either the fourth quarter or the one we're just mentioning.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14217,Question-and-Answer,"But again, I ? those national increases, first of all, they're off a base price and they're not ? they generally run, let's call it, 1%, as a way of just continuing to move the company and sort of make that corporate decision. But the bigger part of this is the weekly discussions we have and decisions we make community-by-community to raise price. I can't emphasize enough that, that's really been the driver of where we've seen most of our price increases.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14218,Question-and-Answer,"And we came out of the early stages of the pandemic were not good to us. We didn't have $300,000 spec inventory for the renter to trade a similar monthly payment for running into ownership with rates. And so in March and April through mid-May, we were not seeing the results that the other big builders we're speaking of for the reason I just gave.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14219,Question-and-Answer,"And then, mid-May, or did we see it coming, but we were careful in the beginning because this was new, we didn't know how long it would last. And so our - for May and June, we treaded. We took the sale. And then in July, we started taking price. August, we took more price. September, we took more, and it has accelerated into the second half of the fourth quarter and now these first 6 weeks of Q1.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14220,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. Thank you for that, Doug. Appreciate it. I guess, secondly, I just want to circle back to cash flow generation and uses of that cash flow. How we should be thinking about 2021? If you could just kind of review what your operating cash flow generation was this year and how you would expect ?21 to compare to that?",Michael Rehaut,4393662
,,,,
14221,Question-and-Answer,,Michael Rehaut,4393662
,,,,
14222,Question-and-Answer,"And again - because obviously, you're going to be doing still a lot of investment in land and rolling out - growing your community count. And how - with your balance sheet where it is right now, from a leverage standpoint, the share count guidance looks to be roughly flat.",Michael Rehaut,4393662
,,,,
14223,Question-and-Answer,"How any share repurchase may or may not play into your thoughts in the next 12 months, particularly as you had some accelerated share count repurchase or share repurchase prior to the pandemic?",Michael Rehaut,4393662
,,,,
14224,Question-and-Answer,"So Michael, we think 2021 will be another positive cash flow year, significantly positive cash flow year because of uncertainty in the world and the growth we're seeing, any buybacks are likely to be back ended, rather than if we were to do it similar to the prior year, where we did it in the front half. ",Marty Connor,4393662
,,,,
14225,Question-and-Answer,"But as I mentioned previously, our first objective is to grow the company through land opportunities and builder opportunities. We have a bit elevated debt-to-cap compared to other builders. We have $420 million due next February that's in the back of our mind. And so we want to maintain flexibility to address leverage, address buybacks, but mostly to buy land and builders.",Marty Connor,4393662
,,,,
14226,Question-and-Answer,Next February is '22.,Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14227,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. '22, excuse me.",Marty Connor,4393662
,,,,
14228,Question-and-Answer,All right. Thank you.,Michael Rehaut,4393662
,,,,
14229,Question-and-Answer,You?re welcome.,Marty Connor,4393662
,,,,
14230,Question-and-Answer,The next question is from Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead.,Operator,4393662
,,,,
14231,Question-and-Answer,"Good morning. When you look at buyer urgency, are you seeing any meaningful difference in how consumers in your different regional markets are behaving or responding to COVID?",Anthony Pettinari,4393662
,,,,
14232,Question-and-Answer,"I think earlier in the year, you talked about community count maybe being 60-40 more insulated versus more impacted by COVID? Just given cases are sort of surging nationwide. I'm wondering if you're seeing any regional differences that are noteworthy?",Anthony Pettinari,4393662
,,,,
14233,Question-and-Answer,"Early on, as we talked about the Northeast was certainly hit harder. There was even construction shutdowns, which affected production. But on the sales side, we were almost 100% remote for a long time. And the sales centers were by appointment only or in some cases completely closed.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14234,Question-and-Answer,"Right now, construction is, thankfully, open everywhere and we anticipate that will be the case. We have gone to by-appointment only in certain sales offices around the country, but it is not affecting activity. This is the second time for us, so we're better at virtual selling.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14235,Question-and-Answer,"The website is - has more videos, more photography. The sales teams are better. We're all better at Zoom and other ways of managing online. So, I'm very confident that notwithstanding some tightening of COVID restrictions and some stricter stay at home orders that we're going to continue to see good activity.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14236,Question-and-Answer,"I can't point to anywhere right now, including California, which I know is very tight. And Pennsylvania and New Jersey, where the governors have been extremely conservative, and the rules are very tight. We're still seeing really, really good activity. So I think that certainly makes us feel good.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14237,Question-and-Answer,"The active adult buyer, which has come back nicely, they could certainly be more cautious and maybe not venture out or certainly not get on an airplane to go to a destination active adult community for a couple of months. So I think that's a fair assumption. We haven't seen that dip at the moment, but I would not be surprised if that side of the business was to slow down a little bit.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14238,Question-and-Answer,"But overall, the other thing that's very interesting with this, because people didn't travel as much for Thanksgiving, and it doesn't feel like they're going to travel as much for winter holiday vacations, and because they're home working, the traffic during the week is higher. We don't - we're not just selling homes on Saturdays and Sundays when they're off of work. And we're selling - we sold a whole bunch of homes on Thanksgiving weekend.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14239,Question-and-Answer,,Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14240,Question-and-Answer,"I mean, many years ago, we were closed on Black Friday. Now Black Friday is a big selling day. People are around. I think it's really changed. I mean, there's still going to be a spring season. I think mid-January to mid-April is still alive and well as a new home season. But I think, the highs and lows have been changed because people are staying in place a bit more. So I hope that answered it for you.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14241,Question-and-Answer,"That's very helpful. And apologies if I missed this in the remarks, but what level of land and development spend is implied in the outlook for '21? Or what degree of spending is necessary to hit your 10% community count growth goal?",Anthony Pettinari,4393662
,,,,
14242,Question-and-Answer,"Anthony, we have all of that land owned or controlled right now. So it is not a significant expenditure to get that. I don't - off the top of my head, know how many of those planned openings are controlled and require a bit of spend, but we have that land in our land bank.",Marty Connor,4393662
,,,,
14243,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, they're currently their own or in control for fiscal '21 openings.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14244,Question-and-Answer,Okay. That?s helpful. I?ll turn it over.,Anthony Pettinari,4393662
,,,,
14245,Question-and-Answer,Thanks.,Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14246,Question-and-Answer,The next question is from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.,Operator,4393662
,,,,
14247,Question-and-Answer,"Thanks for taking my questions. First one, I wanted to follow-up on the - again, on kind of the pricing dynamics and just thinking about tracking kind of the all-in pricing when you consider kind of the cumulative effect, including local level and potentially even incentives or lot premiums.",Mike Dahl,4393662
,,,,
14248,Question-and-Answer,"I think we've been tracking more in kind of like the mid maybe even high single digits, cumulatively over the past 5, 6months compared to - I'm not sure if the like-for-like number is really comparable to that, those numbers you were talking about earlier. But is that the ballpark that seems kind of fair to you when you think all in that like-for-like pricing?",Mike Dahl,4393662
,,,,
14249,Question-and-Answer,"First, Mike, can I just ask, is the - are we still distorted? Or are things better, with the sound?",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14250,Question-and-Answer,"Right now better, but it's just a little tough, the last couple of questions.",Mike Dahl,4393662
,,,,
14251,Question-and-Answer,"Apologies. I don't know if it's our end or if it's the conference call service, but we'll - sincere apologies on that. Our IT people are at least looking into our end. I'm not sure what happened.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14252,Question-and-Answer,"On your question, you are in the right ballpark. We have certain divisions that have had a bit of runaway price increases that is significantly into double-digit. And we've had other divisions that are lower, 1%, 2%, 3%, 4% range. But high, what I'll call, mid to high single digit price increases is, right in right ballpark.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14253,Question-and-Answer,Okay. Thanks very clear. That helps. And my second question?,Mike Dahl,4393662
,,,,
14254,Question-and-Answer,You're welcome.,Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14255,Question-and-Answer,"And my second question is going back to kind of the absorption comment and maybe this is kind of a clarification. When we think about the potential capacity to do mid-30s or high-30s on absorption, as you've seen in prior cycles.",Mike Dahl,4393662
,,,,
14256,Question-and-Answer,"I guess, when I marry that with your comments about pushing price, limiting lot releases, is that actually the level of absorption that you view as optimal for today's positioning? Or is that simply just kind of a more theoretical capacity to sell that? I'm trying to understand, where you'd really look to run the business versus what the theoretical would be?",Mike Dahl,4393662
,,,,
14257,Question-and-Answer,"Sure. Yes. I answered the question in the context of whether we can do better and sell more homes and actually deliver them. I am comfortable getting this company on average to the mid-30s. And every division is different. The size of the homes dictates that. There is certain communities selling $2 million homes, where, that would be difficult. There is other, affordable luxury communities where we could do 40s. But I am comfortable that we have the infrastructure, to get up to the mid-30s, and we're managing the business accordingly.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14258,Question-and-Answer,,Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14259,Question-and-Answer,Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.,Mike Dahl,4393662
,,,,
14260,Question-and-Answer,Welcome.,Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14261,Question-and-Answer,The next question is from John Lovallo with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.,Operator,4393662
,,,,
14262,Question-and-Answer,"Hi, guys. And thank you for taking my question as well. Starting with the base of 120 communities opened in 2020 and moving to 150 to 160 targeted this year. Is there a rule of thumb that we can think about with incremental SG&A dollars that are typically associated with each of the new communities as they come on?",John Lovallo,4393662
,,,,
14263,Question-and-Answer,"Well, I think the first rule of thumb is many of those dollars happen 9 to 15 months before you see deliveries. As you hire a construction team, and you hire a sales team that are site-specific, project manager, et cetera. I think the cost probably run in the $75,000 - $50,000 to $75,000 a month range.",Marty Connor,4393662
,,,,
14264,Question-and-Answer,"Got you. That's helpful. And then maybe changing gears and thinking about capital allocation, one of the things that you mentioned a couple of times, Marty, was the potential for strategic M&A.",John Lovallo,4393662
,,,,
14265,Question-and-Answer,"Curious when you do think about that strategy, are you considering potentially moving - using this as a method of moving downstream in price point, perhaps buying a builder with a lower price point focus?",John Lovallo,4393662
,,,,
14266,Question-and-Answer,"We've evaluated those opportunities. That is certainly something that we would consider if it was the right builder in the right location, and it added value to us. I think we've learned a lot about how to build affordable luxury. I mentioned bringing in construction teams and purchasing teams, which I didn't mention, but purchasing teams from bigger production homebuilders that are really good at counting every nail and every scrap of lumber that sits in a dumpster.",Marty Connor,4393662
,,,,
14267,Question-and-Answer,"And so I don't think we need to buy a builder to learn the business and take their expertise from their local market to our national platform. I think we are now mature enough and have learned enough that, that is not - we don't need to pay a premium to do that. But if there is an opportunity to expand our business locally or regionally through an acquisition, as you described, then we would certainly take a hard look.",Marty Connor,4393662
,,,,
14268,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you very much, guys.",John Lovallo,4393662
,,,,
14269,Question-and-Answer,You?re welcome.,Marty Connor,4393662
,,,,
14270,Question-and-Answer,The next question is from Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. ,Operator,4393662
,,,,
14271,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. ",Susan Maklari,4393662
,,,,
14272,Question-and-Answer,"Hi, Susan.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14273,Question-and-Answer,My first question is thinking about the growth in the community count that you're expecting next year. Is there any color that you can give us in terms of the cadence of expecting those 150 or so communities to come online? And anything we should be thinking about in terms of the geographic mix in there?,Susan Maklari,4393662
,,,,
14274,Question-and-Answer,Sure. Hold on one second. We will get that for you. I love when your questions get into the weeds [ph]. I mean that genuinely.,Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14275,Question-and-Answer,We're getting to that point in the call.,Susan Maklari,4393662
,,,,
14276,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. So the cadence looks good. It's a few less in Q1 and then Q2, Q3 and Q4 are pretty even, call it, sort of, 35 to 45 range of openings per community. The locations are spread throughout the country, with strategically as you would think, South and West, having more as more and more people chase the sun and chase the jobs and the lifestyle.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14277,Question-and-Answer,"So there is less coming out of the Northeast. There is less coming out of the Mid-Atlantic, although, we're now in Atlanta, which will contribute a bit down there. And then there is quite a bit coming out of the South and the Mountain states and the West. So I am - as I look this over, I am not only pleased with cadence. It's not all jammed into the fourth quarter, and I am very pleased with the geographic dispersion.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14278,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then my next question is around, there's obviously been a lot of inflation over the last couple of quarters, especially in terms of lumber pricing. Can you just maybe talk a little bit to how you are factoring that into the margin outlook? And how we should be thinking about inflation generally as we look to the next year?",Susan Maklari,4393662
,,,,
14279,Question-and-Answer,,Susan Maklari,4393662
,,,,
14280,Question-and-Answer,"So our costs are up $17,000 this quarter, and it's all lumber. And as big a number of that is, I am happy because it's for a short window, it was close to double that, maybe not quite double that, but it was a lot more and has come down nicely.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14281,Question-and-Answer,"So we've been very smart. We buy lumber as far out as we can. We have panel plants that are on rail lines, where we're buying the lumber right out of the mill, Pacific Northwest and the South, brings it right in on a railcar and drops it at our yard. We went to very short term contracts on lumber nationwide when the prices spiked.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14282,Question-and-Answer,"And so I'm pleased with how well we've managed these price increases. And obviously, I'm pleased that it feels like it's beginning to come down, and we hope continue to come down.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14283,Question-and-Answer,"Our gross margin guidance reflects price increases to date, less budgeted increases in lumber and labor. It does not have a factor for inflation of price or inflation of labor. And it also impacts the negative impact of mix driven by the Pacific region becoming a smaller percentage of our total.",Marty Connor,4393662
,,,,
14284,Question-and-Answer,Okay. Got you. Thank you guys and good luck.,Susan Maklari,4393662
,,,,
14285,Question-and-Answer,Thank you.,Marty Connor,4393662
,,,,
14286,Question-and-Answer,The next question is from Ken Zener with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.,Operator,4393662
,,,,
14287,Question-and-Answer,"Afternoon. Afternoon, everybody. My question is going to be focused on your rising cash flow, which is you know, it's tied basically to your lower land intensity and gets offset by vertical investments. So my first question is units under construction, first backlog.",Ken Zener,4393662
,,,,
14288,Question-and-Answer,"Many builders report unit center construction, which gives us a sense of how New Year backlog is. So I don't know if you could - I don't think you've done it before, but if you could comment on how many units you have under construction? That's going to be the first question.",Ken Zener,4393662
,,,,
14289,Question-and-Answer,"And then for Marty, land efficiency. If you look at it, owned land it's down about 5% year-over-year, if you do it on a trailing supply - your supply basis. Is that a reasonable number to think about? Or I mean, is there some - something that could drive that more? Or was there something unique, which led to your 5% improvement this year? Thank you.",Ken Zener,4393662
,,,,
14290,Question-and-Answer,"I don't have a specific number for the number of our 7,800 homes in backlog that are under construction. I do know that our backlog is almost a month younger than normal based on when the sales happened this year versus the 10/31 year-end.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14291,Question-and-Answer,"In terms of the owned land coming down, that is part of our return on equity strategy to get a bit more efficient. I think we don't necessarily want to see the owned land go below 3 years of supply. And so as we put more under option and don't buy quite as much, and as our volume goes up, we are making progress in our land holding efficiency.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14292,Question-and-Answer,Thank you.,Ken Zener,4393662
,,,,
14293,Question-and-Answer,The next question is from Jade Rahmani with KBW. Please go ahead. ,Operator,4393662
,,,,
14294,Question-and-Answer,Thank you very much. Question I usually ask. Just wanted to see if you could give an update as to how much capital is invested in each of the multifamily and city living businesses. There is been quite a few announcements on the joint venture side. And just wanted to see if you could provide an update for that?,Jade Rahmani,4393662
,,,,
14295,Question-and-Answer,"Gregg, do you have that?",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14296,Question-and-Answer,"I do. So it looks like here at year-end 2020, for the apartment living business, this is for our rental platform, our investment in that business is approximating, let's call it, $770 million. And the good thing about that number is that we're actively spending a lot of time forming joint ventures to recoup our investment in those assets and bring them to market. So we're looking out over the next 12 to maybe 24 months, we'll probably bring $400 million back in via JV formations.",Gregg Ziegler,4393662
,,,,
14297,Question-and-Answer,"And then if we move on to our city living platform, it looks like we have, at year-end 2020, somewhere around just north of $400 million, let?s call it, $410 million invested in that platform. And so we usually like to break that out into three categories for you to see how a sense of what that number means.",Gregg Ziegler,4393662
,,,,
14298,Question-and-Answer,,Gregg Ziegler,4393662
,,,,
14299,Question-and-Answer,"And so our development assets are about $170 million. And then our land for future projects is about $200 million, and then our joint ventures are about $40 million. Hopefully, that helps.",Gregg Ziegler,4393662
,,,,
14300,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah, that does. And just to clarify, the numbers you gave, $770 million and $410 million, both of those are equity capital, not gross capital inclusive of debt financing?",Jade Rahmani,4393662
,,,,
14301,Question-and-Answer,"Not inclusive of debt financing, right.",Gregg Ziegler,4393662
,,,,
14302,Question-and-Answer,That is our capital.,Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14303,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. And then just secondly, you said that spec sales came in higher than expected. I think last quarter it was 18% quick delivery homes. What was the percentage of this quarter?",Jade Rahmani,4393662
,,,,
14304,Question-and-Answer,"For Q4 settlements, 13% with spec zones, 20% of total settlements was spec units.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14305,Question-and-Answer,It was around 225 more spec units than in the third quarter.,Marty Connor,4393662
,,,,
14306,Question-and-Answer,Okay. Thank you very much for taking the questions.,Jade Rahmani,4393662
,,,,
14307,Question-and-Answer,You?re welcome.,Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14308,Question-and-Answer,The next question is from Jack Micenko with SIG. Please go ahead.,Operator,4393662
,,,,
14309,Question-and-Answer,"Hi. Kind of a follow-on to Jade's question. On the spec, I think you said 450 units well pulled forward. Are you saying that 225 of those were spec? And then I guess my question would be, when we look forward to the ?21 guidance, are you contemplating a higher mix of, I guess, quick delivery or respect or however we would refer to them, next year versus what we saw in fiscal ?20?",Jack Micenko,4393662
,,,,
14310,Question-and-Answer,"No. We have less spec homes now because of how rapidly they have sold. So I think part of ?21 story is, as we mentioned, the backlog is younger, about almost a month younger than normal because it was sold in the second half of the year after the market picked up for us in mid-May. And so that makes the homes in backlog just shy of 30 days younger than a typical year.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14311,Question-and-Answer,"So of course, that - by younger, I mean, they're not as far along in construction on average as prior years because they were sold a bit later through the lumpiness of the year. And we also have - anticipate having less spec deliveries, we will have many, but we will not have - we do not expect to have that 20% we just mentioned, because we - of the very strong sales we've seen over the summer and the fall.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14312,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. That's helpful. I actually want to - maybe the volatility in terms of the delivery guide as much as we did this quarter. Doug, a bigger question for you, very bullish commentary in the press release, and we've messaged we want to improve ROE by, I think, 350 basis points.",Jack Micenko,4393662
,,,,
14313,Question-and-Answer,"Has capital allocation around the build versus the rental or city living development changed? I mean, it's hard to - you got to plan these things through cycles given the construction timing. But is Toll pivoting more towards traditional and maybe less on the rental side, are we hearing that or is it just maybe the way you fund that business is going to change more - on a more pronounced basis?",Jack Micenko,4393662
,,,,
14314,Question-and-Answer,"No, you're hearing that. We have no intention right now of buying a city living property that there will come a time when that changes. But right now, we're on the sidelines. We have, Gregg mentioned, $200 million of the city living investment is in land, and none of that land has started.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14315,Question-and-Answer,"So we have what are really good high-rise sites, one in Manhattan, one in Philadelphia, one in Seattle and one in Los Angeles that are not starting right now. We need to get through this winter. We need to see what things look like in the spring. I am very encouraged by the last 6 weeks of activity in Manhattan.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14316,Question-and-Answer,"I am not telling you it's back, but it is improving. We're hearing that buyers with the talk of vaccines are now thinking about living in New York. We're hearing a few stories of some that render the suburbs, that are coming back to take a look. But that doesn't mean I am ready to start a high-rise in New York, because it's very different from the farm fields.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14317,Question-and-Answer,,Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14318,Question-and-Answer,"In the farm fields, when the market rolls, you can just stop building the next house down the road. In the high-rise business, once you start, you're going and you're going to the top. So we are being very cautious, both in starting those four buildings I mentioned, and on the sidelines for new opportunities.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14319,Question-and-Answer,"On the apartment side, our business is good. Our locations are good. New apartments are holding up. Our rental rates, while they're down a little bit, are hanging in there. Our occupancy rates are up, our delinquency rates have not moved. So overall, while the business is good, we're being cautious. They're not frozen out the way I'd call city living at the moment being frozen out, but we're being highly, highly selective on new opportunities under our apartment living platform until we have some more prospective and visibility on where the multifamily business is added.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14320,Question-and-Answer,Yeah. We are asking the apartment team to produce/digest what they have as quickly as they can before we pay - before we look to many more future opportunities.,Marty Connor,4393662
,,,,
14321,Question-and-Answer,And Marty commented in the prepared script on our other income and joint venture income is guided down a bit in 2021 from what we talked about in prior years. And we have that income. It's in some really good stabilized apartment buildings. But we don't think right now is the time to sell those.,Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14322,Question-and-Answer,"If that time comes in the spring or the summer, we may surprise ourselves and all of you with to more other income for the year, but that's not what we're strategically planning right now. But we don't have to go out and find that other income. It's there. It will be monetized. It's just a question of when the best time to do that is and we don't think it's right now.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14323,Question-and-Answer,Great. Appreciate the color.,Jack Micenko,4393662
,,,,
14324,Question-and-Answer,You?re very welcome. Thank you.,Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14325,Question-and-Answer,The next question is from Matt Bouley with Barclays. Please go ahead.,Operator,4393662
,,,,
14326,Question-and-Answer,"Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I have another one on the ROE. 2020, obviously, major disruption in the spring, and you halted share repurchase, but the market did accelerate, closings grew. I imagine you mixed further to affordable luxury, or I think I heard you say earlier that the return profile is accretive to ROE. But ROE for the full year was still down.",Matt Bouley,4393662
,,,,
14327,Question-and-Answer,"So my question is, what were the biggest challenges to ROE in 2020? And as you look forward, I heard you discuss a lot of levers you're pulling, which of these levers do you think are going to be kind of the incremental changes to ROE in 2021 relative to what was a challenge in 2020? Thank you.",Matt Bouley,4393662
,,,,
14328,Question-and-Answer,"I think the challenge in 2020 was our gross margin, which came down from 2019 and was reflective of the sales environment that we saw 12 months prior, and mix shift out of some of our really high margin California product. So that was the biggest challenge on return on equity in 2020.",Marty Connor,4393662
,,,,
14329,Question-and-Answer,"As we move forward, the pricing power we have is allowing us to drive volume and drive gross margin expansion that is improving our operating margin and improving our return, while at the same time, we are carefully managing our equity through land acquisitions, changing product mix changing and capital allocation.",Marty Connor,4393662
,,,,
14330,Question-and-Answer,"And on the land buying, which I think, longer term, will be the number one driver. I mean, there will certainly be stock buybacks. There will certainly be dividends issued. We will certainly have strong markets where the ROE is outsized because of pricing power and great sales.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14331,Question-and-Answer,"But longer term, the primary driver is an obsessive focus on underwriting land deals at a high ROE, we call it ROI internally, return on investment is how operations works around here, a high threshold, and I am unwavering on it.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14332,Question-and-Answer,"We are committed. It takes a while to turn a cruise ship. Some of these deals that we approve now that have to get some entitlements or have to get some roads in, and then open a sales center and sell a home and deliver a home. That can take some time.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14333,Question-and-Answer,,Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14334,Question-and-Answer,"But it's common. And that, I think, from my perspective, is will be the number one long-term driver is the discipline and the focus we now have on driving ROI through the underwriting of the next piece of land bought.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14335,Question-and-Answer,"Got it. Okay. That's very color. Second one, I had was just on the closings guide. I think I heard you say earlier that 60% of deliveries will be in the second half of the year. And I think that number is maybe a little elevated, but it's not particularly unusual relative to prior years for Toll.",Matt Bouley,4393662
,,,,
14336,Question-and-Answer,"So I'm just curious, given what we're seeing in labor and cycle times, is the expectation that even within that, I don't know if you can get this detailed, but should it be even more Q4 weighted than usual? Or is that kind of typical cadence of closing still the right way to think about it? Thank you.",Matt Bouley,4393662
,,,,
14337,Question-and-Answer,"I think, Q4 weighted is the right way to think about it, particularly based on the rapid increase in sales we just had in the existing Q4.",Marty Connor,4393662
,,,,
14338,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. Thank you, Marty. Thanks, Doug.",Matt Bouley,4393662
,,,,
14339,Question-and-Answer,You?re welcome.,Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14340,Question-and-Answer,And the last question comes from Alex Barron with Housing Research Center. Please go ahead.,Operator,4393662
,,,,
14341,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. Good job. I wanted to - sorry if I missed this, but the margin guidance in the first quarter, was that just related to the market conditions when you took those orders back in the spring?",Alex Barron,4393662
,,,,
14342,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. March, April, half of May.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14343,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. Got it. And then, my second question was, as you've been shifting the product mix to the more affordable luxury, have you guys been able to shorten, I guess, the delivery cycle because on the guidance, it wouldn't appear so, but maybe I'm just missing something?",Alex Barron,4393662
,,,,
14344,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. We had said earlier, Alex, that it's taking 30 days left to build the more affordable luxury homes. I hope that even gets better, but that's what the number is right now.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14345,Question-and-Answer,Have there been any other offsetting factors like taking longer to get a permit or something else?,Alex Barron,4393662
,,,,
14346,Question-and-Answer,"No. Actually, it's shorter because our clients don't go spend 30 days in a design studio and figure out, how they can spend a couple of $100,000 on Portuguese tiles.",Douglas Yearley,4393662
,,,,
14347,Question-and-Answer,"Got it. Okay. Well, best of luck for '21. Thanks.",Alex Barron,4393662

14354,Presentation,"Thank you, Darryl. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Alico's fourth quarter and full year 2020 conference call. On the call today, are John Kiernan, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rich Rallo, Chief Financial Officer.",John Mills,4393652
,,,,
14355,Presentation,"Earlier this morning, the Company issued a press release announcing its results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. If you've not had a chance to view the release, it is available on the Investor Relations portion of the Company's website at alicoinc.com.

14358,Presentation,"With that, I'd like to turn the call over to the Company's President and CEO, Mr. John Kiernan.",John Mills,4393652
,,,,
14359,Presentation,"Thank you, John. And thank you, everyone, for joining us for Alico's inaugural earnings call this morning.",John Kiernan,4393652
,,,,
14360,Presentation,"Since this is our first earnings call together, I'd like to start with a bit of context. Alico has rebounded well from a tough year. I joined more than five years ago to help transform Alico into a more competitive company. In early 2017, we implemented a comprehensive modernization program called Alico 2.0, to improve our operational efficiencies and optimize our asset returns.",John Kiernan,4393652
,,,,
14361,Presentation,"This initiative scrutinized every key aspect of our citrus and land operations, including our corporate and operational cost structures, crop costs, purchasing and procurement programs, professional fees, and human resources efficiency. We also identified non-performing and underperforming assets. The result was to combine our three legacy businesses into one efficient enterprise - Alico Citrus.",John Kiernan,4393652
,,,,
14362,Presentation,"We eliminated certain costs that we believed would not negatively affect our citrus production, divested assets, and lines of business that generated low rates of return, and outsourced parts of our operation that were not profitable. We decreased operating costs by more than $16 million, which represented a 19% reduction, and two years after executing on this initiative, we continue to maintain this reduced operating cost levels.",John Kiernan,4393652
,,,,
14363,Presentation,"At the end of 2018, we had substantially completed these changes and began to concentrate our focus on improving our competitive position as a leader in the global citrus industry. Today, as a result of these initiatives, we are the leading high-quality, low-cost producer of citrus in Florida, and one of the largest citrus growers in the United States.",John Kiernan,4393652
,,,,
14364,Presentation,,John Kiernan,4393652
,,,,
14365,Presentation,"While we have completed our work under our Alico 2.0 Modernization program, we have continued to focus on controlling and managing costs and unlocking additional value for our shareholders to ensure that the legacy of Alico thrives for decades to come. Over the course of fiscal year 2020, we did just that.",John Kiernan,4393652
,,,,
14366,Presentation,"Our Board of Directors has consistently utilized our cash flow to enhance shareholder value. This strategy has been reinforced by Alico's history of paying quarterly dividends, as we have done for the past five decades uninterrupted.",John Kiernan,4393652
,,,,
14367,Presentation,"Last year, the Company increased Alico's dividend by 50% to $0.09 per common share. And today, we announced that the Board of Directors is raising Alico's dividend by another 100% to $0.18 per common share, effective for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. We believe these successive dividend increases reflect our Board of Directors' continued confidence that the business strategy we have developed will support higher level of return of capital to our shareholders over the long-term.",John Kiernan,4393652
,,,,
14368,Presentation,"We repaid approximately $4.5 million of debt, above and beyond our required mandatory principal payments of $10.7 million, and improved our debt-to-equity ratio to 0.68:1 from 0.82:1 a year ago. Over the past five years, we have reduced our debt by 28%, making net principal payments of over $57 million.",John Kiernan,4393652
,,,,
14369,Presentation,"We continue to evaluate our non-citrus assets, and opportunistically sold off ranch land at premium prices to generate cash flow, which returns rates of return for our investors. The Alico Ranch is no longer strategic to our business, and over the past fiscal year, we have sold off acres of this pristine land and reinvested in our primary business, as well as returned some proceeds to our shareholders.",John Kiernan,4393652
,,,,
14370,Presentation,"Most recently, in September, we sold approximately 10,700 acres for $28.5 million to the State of Florida under the Florida Forever program, marking the second sale we have completed with them under this program, for an aggregate of approximately 16,000 acres.",John Kiernan,4393652
,,,,
14371,Presentation,"Because as those acres sold in September would have been critical for our dispersed water management project, we suspended those permit approval activities and renamed that business unit, Land Management and Other Operations. We continue to evaluate real estate opportunities and anticipate additional sales of smaller parcels of the Alico Ranch in the near future.",John Kiernan,4393652
,,,,
14372,Presentation,"We continue to assess opportunities to acquire citrus acres at attractive prices, and announced two land acquisitions this fiscal year. In May 2020, we purchased 334 grove citrus acres, which are adjacent to one of our own citrus groves. More significantly, in October 2020, we acquired approximately 3,280 grove citrus acres for a purchase price of $16.45 million.",John Kiernan,4393652
,,,,
14373,Presentation,"And by using proceeds from the sale of ranch land to the state, we're able to defer almost $4 million of gain from that sale. These acquired citrus acres were well-maintained and are close to other existing Alico groves, and we believe that this new investment will allow us to further leverage the economies of scale for our grove operations and back office.",John Kiernan,4393652
,,,,
14374,Presentation,"Additional acquisitions remain an option within our excess cash deployment strategy. However, we will continue to be highly selective and disciplined and we'll seek to only act on well-sized, well-maintained, and strategically-located properties, so that we can operate as a low-cost, high-producing citrus leader, and deliver competitive returns for shareholders.",John Kiernan,4393652
,,,,
14375,Presentation,"In May 2020, we announced two new four-year citrus fruit supply agreements with our largest customer, Tropicana. As a result of our leadership position within the Florida citrus industry, and the respectful professional relationship developed with Tropicana in recent years, we struck an arrangement, which has mutually beneficial terms for both parties.",John Kiernan,4393652
,,,,
14376,Presentation,,John Kiernan,4393652
,,,,
14377,Presentation,"These contracts, which replaced Alico Citrus supply agreement that expired in September of this year, provides certain protections against significant market price dips, such as the one the citrus industry experienced in this last fiscal year. And there are also certain provisions which protect Tropicana through market pricing increase substantially, which was last seen after Hurricane Irma, in 2017.",John Kiernan,4393652
,,,,
14378,Presentation,"These long-term contracts, which when combined with our existing continuing agreements, commit substantially all of Alico's fruit to Tropicana for the next several years, and will enable the Company to realize competitive margins for at least the next four years.",John Kiernan,4393652
,,,,
14379,Presentation,"In August 2020, we announced a new long-term agreement to provide citrus grove management services, including harvest and haul responsibilities for approximately 7,000 acres owned by Barron Collier Companies, another top-10 Florida citrus grower. This business was a natural extension for us because we have been conducting third-party caretaking services for many years, albeit, on a smaller scale within our largest grove for many smaller customers.",John Kiernan,4393652
,,,,
14380,Presentation,"This is a business that allows us to monetize decades of operational knowledge, especially the efficiencies we have refined for Alico 2.0 Modernization program. We will manage these 7,000 acres just as we manage our own 35,000 net citrus acres, including fruit sales, and are paid a management fee on top of all out-of-pocket cost and expenses. We look to expand this new business segment over the next fiscal year by focusing on companies with significant size groves near our existing groves, who have good operations, but where we can add economic value.",John Kiernan,4393652
,,,,
14381,Presentation,"In addition to those inorganic growth initiatives executed this year, we've also continued to invest heavily in our business for organic growth. Because of our strategic decision to replace trees lost in Hurricane Irma, and increase the density of our citrus groves, Alico has planted more than 1.3 million new trees over the past four years. This level of planting has been substantially higher than the normal level of tree attrition.",John Kiernan,4393652
,,,,
14382,Presentation,"We will continue to evaluate the density throughout our groves and determine the appropriate tree plantings, moving forward. Typically, citrus trees become fruit-bearing approximately four years after planting, and begin to peak around seven to eight years after planting. We anticipate seeing the positive impact of those recent tree plantings in the next couple of years.",John Kiernan,4393652
,,,,
14383,Presentation,"Now, briefly, to discuss our fiscal year results. As expected, and previously announced, our fiscal year results were negatively impacted by citrus pricing pressure, with market prices at their lowest level in the past 10 years. We saw our average blended price per pounds solid fall by 23%, from $2.42 last fiscal year to $1.86 this fiscal year.",John Kiernan,4393652
,,,,
14384,Presentation,"We, along with the rest of the Florida citrus industry, also experienced a decrease in production. However, due to our rigorous cost controls and the pricing protections provided by our long-term supply contracts, we are more fortunate - we were more fortunate than many of our competitors. The downward pressure on citrus pricing is not expected to persist in the next fiscal year.",John Kiernan,4393652
,,,,
14385,Presentation,"Consumption for NFC, Not-from-Concentrate orange juice has remained strong in 2020. We suspect that the reasons for that are because consumers have increased their focus on health and wellness, as well as spending more time at home enjoying breakfast. This surge in demand for NFC orange juice since March 2020 has not abated. We do not believe that this has been a case of panic buying, but rather a sustained level of increased consumption.",John Kiernan,4393652
,,,,
14386,Presentation,"Nielsen data, reports - reflect NFC orange juice consumption increasing 14% for the 52-week period ended September 26, compared with the prior year, and an increase of approximately 19% in the latest four-week period ended October 31, 2020. How does this impact Alico?",John Kiernan,4393652
,,,,
14387,Presentation,,John Kiernan,4393652
,,,,
14388,Presentation,"Well, indirectly. The increase in demand has driven down inventory levels at Florida citrus processors, which we suspect will bode well for market pricing in the next year. Additionally, the harvest season for both Brazil and Mexico, the top exporters of citrus fruit into Florida, are forecasted to be substantially down from the previous year.",John Kiernan,4393652
,,,,
14389,Presentation,"Brazil's fruit crop, which is currently being harvested is forecasted to be down anywhere from 25% to 30% from the prior year. And Mexico's crop, which is just beginning to be harvested is expected to be down in the 50% range from the prior year.",John Kiernan,4393652
,,,,
14390,Presentation,"Alico is well-positioned to benefit significantly from these shifting dynamics as prices rise, because we have one of the lowest cost structures in the citrus industry and very strong long-term supply contracts in place. With higher marketing pricing for citrus, we anticipate that Alico will realize improved margins for our Company during the next - this fiscal year, and be positioned to utilize our strong cash flow to increase the long-term value of our Company.",John Kiernan,4393652
,,,,
14391,Presentation,"With that, I'll turn the call over to Rich to discuss our more detailed financial results.",John Kiernan,4393652
,,,,
14392,Presentation,"Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone.",Rich Rallo,4393652
,,,,
14393,Presentation,"As this is our first earnings call in many years, I would like to remind everyone of the seasonality of our business. The majority of our citrus crop is harvested in the second and third quarters of our fiscal year, and the majority of our profit and cash flows are typically recognized in the second and third quarters as well. Based on this aspect, today, we will focus primarily on full-year results of our business.",Rich Rallo,4393652
,,,,
14394,Presentation,"For the fiscal year 2020, total operating revenues was $92.5 million compared to $122.3 million for the previous fiscal year. Citrus revenues were $89.4 million compared to $190 million for the previous fiscal year.",Rich Rallo,4393652
,,,,
14395,Presentation,"For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, we harvested approximately 7.6 million boxes of fruit, a decrease of 6.6% from the prior fiscal year. The decrease in processed box production was the result of greater fruit drop and smaller fruit size in the current harvest season as compared to the prior harvest season.",Rich Rallo,4393652
,,,,
14396,Presentation,"As mentioned previously by John, the average blended price per pound solids decreased from $2.42 in the prior fiscal year to $1.86 in the current fiscal year. The decrease was primarily due to Florida citrus crop being greater than expected in the 2018-2019 harvest season, leading to high inventory levels at Florida citrus juice processors at the beginning of the 2019-2020 harvest season. The price was also impacted by the continued inflow of imported orange juice, though at lower levels than the prior year.",Rich Rallo,4393652
,,,,
14397,Presentation,"As we look ahead into fiscal year 2021, we do expect an improvement in pricing due to increased consumption of not-from-concentrate orange juice by retail consumers, which in turn is resulting in lower inventory levels. This inventory trend has us well-positioned for the upcoming harvest season, which recently commenced.",Rich Rallo,4393652
,,,,
14398,Presentation,"The increase in operating expenses for the fiscal year 2020 as compared to the fiscal year 2019, primarily relates to the Company receiving less federal relief proceeds, which are recorded as a reduction of operating expenses through the Florida Citrus Recovery Block Grant, relating to Hurricane Irma, during fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019. The Company received federal relief proceeds of approximately $4.6 million and $15.6 million during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 respectively.",Rich Rallo,4393652
,,,,
14399,Presentation,"The Company also recorded additional Grove Management Services expense of approximately $3 million. Partially offsetting this decrease in operating expenses was a reduction in harvest and hauling costs being recorded by the Company as a result of fewer processed boxes being harvested during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, as compared to the same period in the prior year.",Rich Rallo,4393652
,,,,
14400,Presentation,,Rich Rallo,4393652
,,,,
14401,Presentation,"Regarding Grove Management Services expense, in July 2020, the Company executed an agreement with Barron Collier Companies to provide citrus grove caretaking and harvest and haul management services for approximately 7,000 acres. Under the terms of this agreement, Alico is to be reimbursed by Barron Collier for all costs incurred related to providing these services, and is also to receive a management fee based on acres covered under this agreement.",Rich Rallo,4393652
,,,,
14402,Presentation,"As we provide these citrus grove caretaking management services, we will be recording both an increase in revenues and expenses. For the fourth quarter ended September 30, 2020, the Company recorded approximately $3.3 million of operating revenue, including the management fee, and approximately $3 million of operating expenses relating to this arrangement.",Rich Rallo,4393652
,,,,
14403,Presentation,"With regard to the current COVID-19 pandemic, we believe it is important to point out that our harvesting activities were not materially impacted by the pandemic, and there were no disruptions in delivering fruit to the processors this past year. Additionally, to-date, the Company has not experienced any material challenges to its operations from COVID-19.",Rich Rallo,4393652
,,,,
14404,Presentation,"Our Land Management and Other Operations, which was previously called Water Resources and Other Operations, comprised a small percentage of our operating revenue and expenses. This segment includes leasing income from grazing rights leases, hunting leases, a farm lease, a lease to a third party of an aggregate mine, leases of oil extraction rights, and other miscellaneous income.",Rich Rallo,4393652
,,,,
14405,Presentation,"As a result of the decision to no longer pursue permit approval activities for the water dispersed storage project, the Company renamed this segment Land Management and Other Operations to better reflect the components of this segment.",Rich Rallo,4393652
,,,,
14406,Presentation,"Revenues for Land Management and Other Operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 decreased slightly this year as compared to the prior year, primarily due to a reduction in leased acreage relating to a cattle grazing lease. The reduction in leased acreage was due to a certain acres, which were included under this lease agreement, being sold in September 2019.",Rich Rallo,4393652
,,,,
14407,Presentation,"General and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 decreased 27% to $11 million compared to $15.1 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to professional fees relating to a corporate litigation matter of approximately $2.3 million being incurred in fiscal year 2019. This litigation was settled, and no further expenses were incurred relating to this matter during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020.",Rich Rallo,4393652
,,,,
14408,Presentation,"Additionally, as part of this settlement, the Company recorded consulting and separation fees of approximately $800,000 during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019. The Company also recognized reductions from a one-time pension expense related to its deferred retirement benefit plan of approximately $1 million in fiscal year 2019, a reduction in payroll expenses for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 of approximately $300,000 relating to one of the senior managers resigning in December 2019, and a reduction in bonuses granted to senior management, a decrease in stock compensation expense of approximately $200,000 as a result of certain stock option expense being accelerated in fiscal year September 30, 2019, and other smaller decreases in rent, consulting, and Board of Director fees aggregating approximately $400,000.",Rich Rallo,4393652
,,,,
14409,Presentation,"Partially offsetting these decreases were reductions in stock compensation expense of approximately $800,000 recognized in fiscal year September 30, 2019 as a result of a former senior executive forfeiting his stock options as part of the settled litigation and an increase in Directors and Officers insurance of approximately $200,000.",Rich Rallo,4393652
,,,,
14410,Presentation,,Rich Rallo,4393652
,,,,
14411,Presentation,"Other income for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 was approximately $24.5 million and approximately $5 million, respectively. The increase in other income was primarily due to the Company recording a higher gain on sale of real estate, property and equipment, and assets held for sale in the fiscal year 2020, as compared to fiscal year 2019.",Rich Rallo,4393652
,,,,
14412,Presentation,"In fiscal year 2020, we recorded a gain of approximately $30.4 million, which was generated primarily from the sale of land on our West Ranch in September 2020 to the State of Florida. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, the Company recorded a gain of approximately $13.2 million.",Rich Rallo,4393652
,,,,
14413,Presentation,"Additionally, the Company recognized a reduction of approximately $1.2 million in interest expense as a result of the reduction of its long-term debt attributable to making its mandatory principal payments, prepaying approximately $4.5 million on its debt obligations and a reduction in interest rates.",Rich Rallo,4393652
,,,,
14414,Presentation,"As mentioned, during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, we received approximately $4.6 million of additional proceeds under the Florida Citrus Recovery Block Grant program relating to Hurricane Irma damage sustained in September 2017.",Rich Rallo,4393652
,,,,
14415,Presentation,"To date, the Company has received approximately $20.2 million of proceeds under this program, which represented reimbursements on the Part 1 and Part 2 of the program. The timing and the amount to be received under Part 3 of this program is yet to be finalized.",Rich Rallo,4393652
,,,,
14416,Presentation,"For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, the Company reported net income attributable to Alico common stockholders of approximately $23.7 million compared to net income attributable to Alico common stockholders of approximately $37.8 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019. The net income for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 was in line with the Company's most recent net income guidance of $22 million to $24 million.",Rich Rallo,4393652
,,,,
14417,Presentation,"Additionally, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, the Company's EBITDA of $51.8 million was in line with the Company's EBTIDA guidance of $49.5 million to $52.5 million. We continue to show strength in our balance sheet and expect stronger cash flows in fiscal year 2021. Our working capital at September 30, 2020 was $30.7 million, representing a 2.5:1 ratio. In addition, we have experienced a steady improvement in our debt-to-equity ratio for the past three years. In 2020, 2019, and 2018 the ratios were 0.68:1, 0.82:1, and 1:1 respectively.",Rich Rallo,4393652
,,,,
14418,Presentation,"As part of our acquisition in October 2020 of the 3,280 gross acres, previously mentioned, we utilized a portion of the proceeds from the sale of approximately 10,700 acres to the State of Florida in September 2020 to fund the purchase, which was structured to allow us to defer approximately $4 million of taxes related to the gain on sale.",Rich Rallo,4393652
,,,,
14419,Presentation,We also announced today a doubling of our dividend to $0.18 per share compared to $0.09 per share. The $0.18 per share dividend will be paid to our stockholders of record as of December 24 2020.,Rich Rallo,4393652

Additionally, we have expanded into fee-generating lines of related businesses, as you saw this past fiscal year with the growth of our third-party management service.",John Kiernan,4393652
,,,,
14427,Presentation,"The increased confidence we have in the rebound of market pricing in the next fiscal year, along with our control of our cost structure will allow us to provide some guidance as to net income, adjusted net income, EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA for the upcoming fiscal year. We are projecting net income of $7.5 million to $10 million; adjusted net income of $4.5 million to $6.9 million; EBITDA between $29 million and $33 million; and adjusted EBITDA between $25 million and $28.8 million.",John Kiernan,4393652

,,,,
14433,Presentation,"Thank you, John. Hello, and welcome to our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020 financial results conference call. Joining us today are Bill Angrick, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jorge Celaya, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks. ",Julie Davis,4393645
,,,,
14434,Presentation,"The following discussion or responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, December 8, 2020, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. ",Julie Davis,4393645
,,,,
14435,Presentation,"As you listen to today's call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. ",Julie Davis,4393645
,,,,
14436,Presentation,"During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.",Julie Davis,4393645
,,,,
14437,Presentation,"We also use certain supplemental operating data as a measure of certain components of operating performance, which we also believe is useful for management and investors. The supplemental operating data includes gross merchandise volume and should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results. ",Julie Davis,4393645
,,,,
14438,Presentation,"At this time, I'd like to turn the presentation over to our CEO, Bill Angrick.",Julie Davis,4393645
,,,,
14439,Presentation,"Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to our Q4 earnings call. I'll review our Q4 performance and provide an update on key strategic initiatives. Next, Jorge Celaya will provide more details on the quarter. Liquidity Services reported strong Q4 results due to increasing customer adoption of our safe and effective e-commerce solutions. Across all business segments, as businesses and governments seek proven digital solutions to stay competitive, driven by our multiyear transformational investments and marketplace economies of scale, we recorded significant year-over-year growth in both our top and bottom line financial results. ",William Angrick,4393645
,,,,
14440,Presentation,"We're very proud of our team's efforts during the quarter to maintain a safe work environment for our associates while helping our customers, many of whom are small businesses, efficiently conduct commerce globally in over 500 B2B product categories. ",William Angrick,4393645
,,,,
14441,Presentation,"Liquidity Services continues to play an essential role in how businesses and government agencies operate within the $100 billion plus reverse supply chain market. Our marketplace platform, buyer base, software and services are best-in-class and deliver a competitive advantage for our customers. Our continued growth and success reflects several macro trends, including the secular growth of online retail, which drives the need for comprehensive Returns Management solutions; the need for organizations of all sizes to embrace technology to drive overall supply chain efficiencies and to monetize assets; and finally, the increasing focus by business and government customers on sustainability. ",William Angrick,4393645
,,,,
14442,Presentation,,William Angrick,4393645
,,,,
14443,Presentation,"Our solutions uniquely address all of these customer needs and the investments we have made the past few years in our My Marketplace platform, marketing stack and technology infrastructure have positioned Liquidity Services extremely well to meet customer needs, both today and in the future. These needs are not unique to the climate of the pandemic, Liquidity Services is a constant cyclical business which helps clients create value both in periods of economic expansion as well as contraction. We are distinctly well positioned to benefit from anticipated growth in the reverse supply chain market. ",William Angrick,4393645
,,,,
14444,Presentation,"Overall, our strategy and recent platform investments have been rewarded by strong financial results during the second half of our fiscal year 2020, allowing us to finish the year as a stronger, more efficient business. Our e-commerce marketplace capabilities continue to drive strong recovery for our sellers and have enabled us to scale our services quickly as more customers seek efficient self-service solutions to manage surplus and return goods in the supply chain. In turn, our higher recovery rates have driven increasing adoption of our consignment pricing model, positively impacting gross profit margins. ",William Angrick,4393645
,,,,
14445,Presentation,"GMV in our GovDeals segment grew a record 35% year-over-year as more government agencies utilized our digital platform to transact higher volumes, and a growing buyer base and automated asset promotion tools drove higher realized values through our marketplace. This performance has sparked growing interest in our platform by sellers of higher ticket items in the transportation and heavy equipment categories. GMV in our Retail Supply Chain Group segment grew 33% year-over-year as more large and SMB retail sellers adopted our platform and existing customers increased their transaction volumes on our marketplace. Of note, GMV for our self-service retail solutions more than doubled year-over-year as more customers embrace the flexibility and convenience of selling items directly on our platform. ",William Angrick,4393645
,,,,
14446,Presentation,"GMV in our Capital Assets Group segment declined 8% year-over-year due to the wind-down of the DoD scrap contract. Excluding the expired scrap contract, CAG segment GMV grew 3% year-over-year during the quarter. Our CAG heavy equipment category grew strongly during the quarter as sellers took advantage of our self-service solutions, and our marketplace continued to deliver strong results. The extensibility of our e-commerce platform to third-party sellers on a global scale is another important growth vector for Liquidity Services. For example, we launched our new all-surplus platform in South Africa recently and have quickly become a destination in that region for both consumer goods and heavy equipment with over 1,000 online completed transactions to date. ",William Angrick,4393645
,,,,
14447,Presentation,"Lastly, our Machinio segment grew revenue by 5% during the quarter as equipment owners and dealers began to prepare for a broader reopening of the economy by embracing Machinio's digital marketing solutions to connect with buyers at lower costs when compared to traditional marketing channels. We are excited to end fiscal year '20 with strong non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA results and improved margins as we leverage our new marketplace platform and technology improvements to the benefit of our sellers, our buyers and our shareholders. ",William Angrick,4393645
,,,,
14448,Presentation,"Looking forward, we are focused on becoming a $1 billion GMV annualized business. We are seeing the benefits of increasing scale, driven by strong tailwinds, which allows us to leverage our fixed cost and marketplace business model. Because of our strong and growing buyer base, coupled with intelligent machine-driven asset promotion tools, more clients are adopting our consignment pricing model to share in the upside created through stronger price realization in our marketplace. Thus, we believe growth in our GMV and gross profit, which is a proxy for net revenue, are the best measurements of our progress. Because GAAP revenue was impacted by the changing mix in our pricing models, the efficiency of our business is best measured by adjusted EBITDA margins as a percentage of gross profit, which have steadily improved. Together, these metrics provide shareholders a good measurement of both the sustainability and efficiency of our business. ",William Angrick,4393645
,,,,
14449,Presentation,,William Angrick,4393645
,,,,
14450,Presentation,"In closing, we'd like to thank our employees for their dedication to our mission, and we believe we are well positioned to help our customers navigate the global impacts of the pandemic and beyond using the strength of our online platform and the ingenuity of our team. We're excited to continue our role as a global market leader to create value for our customers and shareholders in the years ahead. ",William Angrick,4393645
,,,,
14451,Presentation,I'll now turn it over to Jorge for more details on the quarter.,William Angrick,4393645
,,,,
14452,Presentation,"Good morning. As Bill mentioned, we finished our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 with a strong showing in GMV, GAAP net income, GAAP EPS and adjusted EBITDA. These results during an unprecedented global pandemic reflect the value of our services for sellers and buyers and the benefits of our multiyear transformation and platform investments, combined with the realignment, rationalization and streamlining of our operating expenses. ",Jorge Celaya,4393645
,,,,
14453,Presentation,"We are pleased with the positive reception for and increasing customer adoption of our services. A key purpose of transforming our technology and business offerings has been to enable us to leverage our platform in order to scale our business that combines with a mix of services for better margins and more profitable results. Our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 results demonstrate how this can come to fruition. Comparing to the fourth quarter of 2019, we generated positive results that include GMV of $196.9 million, up 25%; GAAP net income of $5.4 million, up $10.7 million; GAAP earnings per share of $0.16, up $0.32; and adjusted EBITDA of $9 million, up $9.7 million. ",Jorge Celaya,4393645
,,,,
14454,Presentation,"Fourth quarter revenue of $55.9 million was down $2.9 million, reflecting a stronger mix of full-service and self-service consignment model transactions as compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, where the mix of our purchase model transactions last year were a greater proportion of total GMV. ",Jorge Celaya,4393645
,,,,
14455,Presentation,"These fourth quarter results reflected, one, increasing activity in our GovDeals segment with government agencies able to utilize our digital platform. Our growing buyer base in GovDeals and use of automated asset promotion tools helped with higher recovery values within our marketplace, especially in the vehicles category, where, in combination with overall market trends, our recovery rates increased year-over-year. ",Jorge Celaya,4393645
,,,,
14456,Presentation,"Two, solid growth in our Retail Supply Chain Group as more large than SMB retailers adopted our platform and support services and existing customers increased their transaction volumes. Three, growth in our Machinio segment as equipment owners and dealers leveraged our digital marketing solution to connect buyers at a lower cost than traditional methods. ",Jorge Celaya,4393645
,,,,
14457,Presentation,"Four, solid growth related to our new focus on the heavy equipment vertical in our CAG segment, which offset the wind-down of the DoD scrap contract. CAG continues experiencing having a more episodic nature in its activities and international COVID travel constraints. And five, improved gross profit margins, driven by increasing mix and adoption of our consignment model over our purchase model in certain segments, and an increase in recovery rates across several verticals. ",Jorge Celaya,4393645
,,,,
14458,Presentation,"More specifically, comparing the fourth quarter results to the same quarter last year, our GovDeals segment was up 35% on GMV and 32% on revenue. Our retail RSCG segment was up 33% on GMV and up 7% on revenue. And our CAG segment GMV was down 8% and down 50% on the revenue, yet excluding the surplus contract, the CAG segment GMV was up 3% and revenue down 34%. Machinio's revenue was up 5%. ",Jorge Celaya,4393645
,,,,
14459,Presentation,"We have a debt-free balance sheet and ended the quarter with $76 million in cash, up $9.5 million compared to the fourth quarter ending September 30, 2019, and up sequentially from this past quarter and which also included $4 million in stock repurchases. ",Jorge Celaya,4393645
,,,,
14460,Presentation,,Jorge Celaya,4393645
,,,,
14461,Presentation,"Turning to our full fiscal year 2020 results. A year marked by the economics and behavioral shifts from the global pandemic, our RSCG segment GMV was up 16.3% and revenue increased 7.2%. Our GovDeals segment was down about 0.5 percentage point for both revenue and GMV. And our CAG segment GMV declined 27.9% and revenue declined 51.1%, inclusive of the transition out of the DoD scrap contract. Our Machinio segment revenue increased 28.8%. ",Jorge Celaya,4393645
,,,,
14462,Presentation,"Looking ahead to fiscal year 2021, we will continue to focus on growing and expanding our self-service offerings and our all-surplus aggregated marketplace. We remain focused on executing our RISE strategy, which we believe will continue to better position us through flexible seller service offerings and an enhanced buyer experience. ",Jorge Celaya,4393645
,,,,
14463,Presentation,"We are closely monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our economy, our sellers, our buyers and on our own operations, while we continue to deliver our services reliably to existing and new customers. ",Jorge Celaya,4393645
,,,,
14464,Presentation,"At this time, as we report our year-end results, we are comfortable providing guidance for Q1 of fiscal year 2021, despite the continued uncertainty created by the global pandemic and its impact on the global economy. We will evaluate providing guidance on a quarter-by-quarter basis during fiscal year 2021. ",Jorge Celaya,4393645
,,,,
14465,Presentation,"For our first quarter fiscal year 2021, our outlook reflects continued year-over-year growth in our GovDeals and RSCG segments, as our e-commerce solution provides safe and efficient ways to transact, potentially slightly higher results in our CAG segment even as the pandemic continues to impact the global economy and benefits of our cost control and cost-reduction measures. ",Jorge Celaya,4393645
,,,,
14466,Presentation,"We also anticipate our service mix between consignment and purchase models will vary quarter-to-quarter. And that we will continue to launch incremental functionality across our marketplaces to enhance the seller and buyer experiences, which may increase our sequential marketing and IT spend. ",Jorge Celaya,4393645
,,,,
14467,Presentation,Management's guidance for the next fiscal quarter is as follows. We expect GMV for fiscal year Q1 of 2021 to range from $175 million to $195 million; the GAAP net income is expected for fiscal year first quarter of 2021 in the range of $2 million to $3 million; with a corresponding GAAP earnings per share for Q1 of 2021 ranging from $0.06 to $0.09 per share. We estimate non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for Q1 of 2021 to range from $5 million to $6.5 million. Non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share is estimated for Q1 of 2021 in the range of $0.08 to $0.12 per share. This guidance assumes that we have diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the quarter of approximately 34.6 million shares. We will now take your questions.,Jorge Celaya,4393645
,,,,
14468,Question-and-Answer,[Operator Instructions]. And our first question is from Gary Prestopino from Barrington.,Operator,4393645
,,,,
14469,Question-and-Answer,"A couple of questions here. First of all, Bill, given that we're seeing more and more online shopping, are the online retailers at this point starting to see a greater percentage of returns coming back to them that's coming back to you? At one time, I think something like the retail returns on e-commerce were about 10%. Is that about right of all shopping? And has that really increased at all?",Gary Prestopino,4393645
,,,,
14470,Question-and-Answer,"Gary, number one, we've witnessed an earlier sharper increase in the proportion of retail moving online. The volume of online sales growing as it has will increase the volume of returned goods into our channel. The return rates are higher than 10% in many categories. ",William Angrick,4393645
,,,,
14471,Question-and-Answer,"I don't think any of these online or omnichannel players want to risk losing any sales. They're encouraging clients, customers to spend freely. There's some promotional elements to that. They encourage multiple SKUs of different sizes, if needed, to get to the right product. ",William Angrick,4393645
,,,,
14472,Question-and-Answer,,William Angrick,4393645
,,,,
14473,Question-and-Answer,"So we know that return rates are well above 10% in many categories, as high as 30% in some categories. You have a lot of higher value consumer electronics items, where you see sometimes the -- either technical glitches or buyer's remorse and those items going back. Apparel is a huge category of returns. Housewares, even housewares is a big area of returns. ",William Angrick,4393645
,,,,
14474,Question-and-Answer,"And now we have lots of bulk items being sold digitally, appliances, furniture and we are uniquely positioned to help in those areas, too, because we have a natural distribution footprint which helps these online retailers reduce costs by allowing those consumers to return to our facilities. ",William Angrick,4393645
,,,,
14475,Question-and-Answer,"So without question, we're seeing just this massive secular growth in online retail. Probably various analysts have said, we've gone from roughly mid-teens penetration of total retail in online to about 30% penetration of total retail online now in a matter of about 9 months.",William Angrick,4393645
,,,,
14476,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. That's going to benefit you, certainly. And then can you just talk a little bit about some of these automated asset promotion tools that you're using that help to drive growth in GMV and GovDeals? What does that entail?",Gary Prestopino,4393645
,,,,
14477,Question-and-Answer,"Sure. And I think that's a broader theme, Gary, certainly not limited to our business and our industry, but we know our marketplace business model benefits from scale, and we drove organically 25% more volume in our e-commerce platform. So that's always going to help a marketplace business model generate operating leverage. ",William Angrick,4393645
,,,,
14478,Question-and-Answer,"When you overlay additionally a more efficient business, driven by technology investment, that's what really becomes compelling. For example, with the investments we've made in our marketing technology stack, we're now understanding what every individual buyer reviews, bids on and purchases. And so we have artificial intelligence and machine-driven automation to then present available assets to those buyers dynamically to increase the propensity of them bidding and buying in our marketplace. ",William Angrick,4393645
,,,,
14479,Question-and-Answer,"So we know Gary Prestopino, he browsed and bid on pickup trucks, and that's an area that he likes. So the next time you log in, you're going to see recommendation engine featuring those assets for you as opposed to the other buyers. And so that learning and that algorithm strengthens over time and allows us to make better matching available between the supply of assets and the buyers who come to our marketplace.",William Angrick,4393645
,,,,
14480,Question-and-Answer,"Do you also have -- I'm sorry, do you also have a mechanism where a specific piece of equipment, category, comes up for sale that you can send e-mails to buyers that had...",Gary Prestopino,4393645
,,,,
14481,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, absolutely. We have saved search agent that will automatically send the selected filter or desired assets to individual buyers. We'd also point out that over 50% of our bidding is occurring on mobile devices. And we've invested over the last few years a much stronger mobile responsive design, which is allowing these buyers to have a better experience and encourage more robust activity, including bidding on mobile devices. ",William Angrick,4393645
,,,,
14482,Question-and-Answer,"So all of those things come together to help drive broadly a more efficient business model and higher buyer participation which, as you know, drives higher recovery rates, which allows us to satisfy sellers and do more business.",William Angrick,4393645
,,,,
14483,Question-and-Answer,Our next question is from Dalton Kern from Baird.,Operator,4393645
,,,,
14484,Question-and-Answer,"This is Dalton on for Colin. Congrats on the quarter. Just a couple here. First off, looking at guidance for next quarter, with the bulk of the holiday shopping season behind you and given a lot of the commentary we've heard, then a lot of shopping, and you said a lot of the returns have really been pulled earlier into the quarter than typical. I guess my question is, what are really the biggest unknowns as we look through the rest of December? And what really has to change dramatically for things to move one way or another versus where you're looking at them right now a week into December?",Dalton Kern,4393645
,,,,
14485,Question-and-Answer,,Dalton Kern,4393645
,,,,
14486,Question-and-Answer,"Well, Dalton, you realize -- you rightly point out that this, for us, for most companies, is a call that's occurring later in the quarter than typically is the case, and that's why we are in a position to provide guidance. ",William Angrick,4393645
,,,,
14487,Question-and-Answer,"That being said, the unknowns would be policy decisions affecting availability of facilities principally in our government business and in our industrial capital assets group segment. Those are segments where decisions to do full closures have adversely impacted the ability to conduct sort of routine pickup of assets upon the completion of the sale, which prevents us from booking completed GMV and revenue. ",William Angrick,4393645
,,,,
14488,Question-and-Answer,"Now those policies have been unevenly applied, and I think they've improved significantly in the U.S. over the course of the last 6 months. Having said that, Europe still has many significant closure policies and restrictions on travel, that has been a headwind for the Capital Assets Group business in the short term. In the U.S., you have certain jurisdictions. California is an example, where it's still very harsh in some areas to operate even within the government arena. So those are things that are out there. ",William Angrick,4393645
,,,,
14489,Question-and-Answer,"Our guidance, as we sit here, reflects the trends that we're seeing, if something would take a really sharp correction, you could still have some interruption in the government business. And we don't get in the business of prognosticating the government policies. We're very enthusiastic about the macro trends and the macro trends suggest, beyond any short-term response to a pandemic, that these clients they want to have more flexibility. They want to work more efficiently. ",William Angrick,4393645
,,,,
14490,Question-and-Answer,"Specifically in the government business, you have 10% to 20% hits to revenue in those county and city jurisdictions. They're looking to be more productive. They're looking to monetize idle equipment and also to continue to fly the flag of sustainability. I mean our business model is so unique in that no one has to drive to an event, none of these assets need to be shipped from a seller location to an auction yard. ",William Angrick,4393645
,,,,
14491,Question-and-Answer,"We allow these government entities, and for that matter corporate entities, equipment dealers to sell the items in place. The asset doesn't move. We connect with the buyer. The buyer efficiently picks up. So that's reducing the carbon footprint for all of our clients and our buyers, and it's something that we believe is getting more and more attention. ",William Angrick,4393645
,,,,
14492,Question-and-Answer,"We've been doing it for 20 years, by the way, but we think it's getting more attention from our customers, we think it's getting more attention from institutional shareholders who are very focused on ESG investing. So I think those are the macro trends that we pay attention to.",William Angrick,4393645
,,,,
14493,Question-and-Answer,"If I could add, this is Jorge. In addition to what Bill has just said, we also, as you saw in my comments, CAG, Capital Assets Group, continues to have an episodic business where you have large deals that come and go from time to time with different customers, and they could be a consignment deal or a purchase deal depending on how the transaction evolves or it could get delayed by a month, which would put it in the next quarter. ",Jorge Celaya,4393645
,,,,
14494,Question-and-Answer,"So we're comfortable with our guidance, but you have to have a range because you can't have things that slips, for example. And that would be another factor as to why this late in the quarter, we still have some, obviously, some range in our business in addition to what Bill has just said.",Jorge Celaya,4393645
,,,,
14495,Question-and-Answer,Great. That helps a lot. And then maybe turning to registered buyer growth. Trends have been looking pretty promising there. I'm pretty clear that you've been able to drive a bit of an increase in bringing more buyers to the platform. ,Dalton Kern,4393645
,,,,
14496,Question-and-Answer,"But to the extent to which that translates into growth in auction participants and transaction volume, just wondering, is that kind of a mix shift impact there that's driving that delta? Or is that something that you're consciously trying to drive conversion of registered buyers to drive more participants in transaction growth? Or is that just something that's kind of a secondary function of all the other user and interface improvements that you've already been mentioning?",Dalton Kern,4393645
,,,,
14497,Question-and-Answer,,Dalton Kern,4393645
,,,,
14498,Question-and-Answer,"Well, those are two metrics that we've reported for a long time, Dalton. And let me just make sure that we have some clarity on the difference. So our business is always focused on increasing the number of unique participants for every item sold. We've had robust participation, very strong recovery rates and the quality of the buyers that we're attracting, quality of the buyers, isn't increasing. ",William Angrick,4393645
,,,,
14499,Question-and-Answer,These are buyers who are buying larger ticket items. We're seeing a lot of participation in the transportation and vehicle categories and the construction and heavy equipment categories. And so the average value per transaction is trending up. And I think that's just a function of the things we talked about. ,William Angrick,4393645
,,,,
14500,Question-and-Answer,"When you look at being an efficient seller and capturing more value for the items sold, you want to remove a lot of these make-ready costs and transportation costs and really get to the highest net recovery possible. And so we've been focused on bringing the right buyers to bear for those higher ticket items. ",William Angrick,4393645
,,,,
14501,Question-and-Answer,"The other thing I would point out is that we've added functionality to benefit the seller so that the sellers can do hybrid sales of items, which include the traditional competitive online auction where the highest bidder wins, coupled with a make-offer alternative.",William Angrick,4393645
,,,,
14502,Question-and-Answer,"So the buyer comes in and wants to preempt the auction and hit the bid and buy it now, they can do that. And so when you have a buy it now transaction, there's only one bidder in theory, one bidder for that item recorded in the auction participant number, so that's why that number might be lower than traditionally has been the case.",William Angrick,4393645
,,,,
14503,Question-and-Answer,"Right. That makes sense. And then just one more quick one, and then I'll hop back in the queue if I have anything else. But you mentioned the goal of driving $1 billion in GMV. Obviously, that's a long-term plan here. But just kind of wondering as you look at the opportunity ahead of you, how much of that do you think lies within your existing footprint and existing verticals and is just driven by increased buyer growth and penetration there? Or do you think you need to expand into new marketplaces, new verticals and just expand the total TAM there in order to reach that sort of scale?",Dalton Kern,4393645
,,,,
14504,Question-and-Answer,"Well, Dalton, I think the market is there for us in our current verticals to achieve the $1 billion annualized GMV milestone. We're roughly $200 million of GMV per quarter coming out of the September quarter. And our business does have various puts and takes and seasonality. But the macro trend for us -- just consider that the growth in online retail recently is in the 30% to 50% year-over-year growth through the Black Friday, Cyber Monday. 30% to 50% year-over-year growth. ",William Angrick,4393645
,,,,
14505,Question-and-Answer,"We're highly leveraged to benefit from that trend in the retail supply chain, just organically, as you look at the mix shift occurring there. We've got the best distribution center footprint. We've got the thickest buyer base. We have the merchandising and sales channels in place to deliver outstanding results and throughput and velocity for e-commerce retailers, omnichannel retailers and the vendors who supply them. ",William Angrick,4393645
,,,,
14506,Question-and-Answer,"We know that there's a secular trend to embrace digitization and supply chain, and how you manage and value and monetize assets. We're a proven leader in that category. So as industrial supply chain embraces sustainability, looking to reuse and redeploy high-value equipment around the world, we're very well positioned to be a champion of that cause, of that best practice. ",William Angrick,4393645
,,,,
14507,Question-and-Answer,"And in the government arena, it's a $3 billion TAM in the U.S. Our business is, call it, 15% to 20% penetrated with a very strong network effect. We believe we can be that best practice, that proven data-driven solution provider for these governments who are looking to be more efficient, who are looking to be more environmentally responsible. So there's a terrific opportunity in our current core business. ",William Angrick,4393645

14509,Question-and-Answer,"And what we're finding is that people are getting religion probably a little sooner because they've been forced to rethink how they do business. And that's probably the biggest takeaway for all industries in the pandemic environment is people have been open-minded to looking at the digital alternative to the legacy solution. And when we get the opportunity to present our digital marketplace and self-service solutions, people don't go back, and that's the real opportunity here.",William Angrick,4393645
,,,,
14510,Question-and-Answer,And we have another question from Gary from Barrington.,Operator,4393645
,,,,
14511,Question-and-Answer,"Sure. Where do you think -- I mean, the contingent business is about 82% of your total business, where do you think that goes? Do you think that continues to creep higher, Bill? And then the second question would be -- or the second question would be what leads to the decision to go contingent versus purchase, self-service versus full-service on the sellers' end?",Gary Prestopino,4393645
,,,,
14512,Question-and-Answer,"Sure. Well, we were born as a 100% consignment business 20 years ago. And we always suggested to our clients, it's in their interest to pay us on a revenue share basis because they share in the upside created as we drive higher participation and higher competition. And so we've always had that philosophy. ",William Angrick,4393645
,,,,
14513,Question-and-Answer,"However, we've always provided a menu of options. We don't want to dictate to our clients what they must use. We want to give them the flexibility to migrate between those as they see fit. So the pricing model, consignment versus purchase, has always been available to our clients. We've just noticed that as clients have experienced the marketplace, they have elected to use more of the consignment pricing model recently. ",William Angrick,4393645
,,,,
14514,Question-and-Answer,"And we don't necessarily predict or forecast in the future where that's going to be, we just think there's a broader trend as we have a transparent marketplace as sellers can see the results they've elected to drive more to the consignment model. They get the upside created when we increase the pricing for these assets. ",William Angrick,4393645
,,,,
14515,Question-and-Answer,"We're still happy to do purchase model if the clients so choose, and we have people that participate in that market. And there are reasons that they might do that related to inventory controls or SOX controls. But I think the broader opportunity is to create an incentive aligned structure with our sellers to share the upside with them as our marketplace becomes more and more competitive, more robust. ",William Angrick,4393645
,,,,
14516,Question-and-Answer,"In terms of self-service versus full service, again, there's a continuum. Clients that need the assistance to catalog and manage sales, we will provide that assistance. Now there is a cost to do that, and that increases the overall fees that they would pay. We've taught -- well, first, we developed outstanding tools to allow sellers to manage the transaction process on their own after an initial orientation, and many of them see the benefits of that. ",William Angrick,4393645
,,,,
14517,Question-and-Answer,"They like to have the control, the ability to set the terms of their sale, load their own equipment. And with the data that we can provide through their client portal, they feel very comfortable doing that. And so we see, not just in our industry but across the landscape of B2B solutions, that many corporate and government clients very much like that self-service alternative. And we're providing it, and we think that's a trend that will strengthen over time.",William Angrick,4393645
,,,,
14518,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. So if I read it right, you're saying that the self-service is becoming more prevalent overall versus full service. I mean can you kind of break down, if you'd make it public, the percentage of the consignment that is full versus self? Or is that something you don't give out?",Gary Prestopino,4393645
,,,,
14519,Question-and-Answer,"Well, it's not a metric that we give out, but we would say it's the majority of our business. And it's one that has natural attraction for corporate and government clients because they're capturing more of the value created in the transaction because they pay a lower fee when it's self-service versus full service. ",William Angrick,4393645
,,,,
14520,Question-and-Answer,,William Angrick,4393645
,,,,
14521,Question-and-Answer,"Now again, certain clients are in extremis, that they don't have certain resources or they need certain assistance with logistics or valuation. But we're marshaling our data, we're marshaling our automated marketing tools to deliver that in a self-service package, where sellers can efficiently have a smarter and faster way to list and sell assets, get great execution on the buyer side. ",William Angrick,4393645
,,,,
14522,Question-and-Answer,"We're there to help them on anything else that would arise during the course of that transaction. So psychologically, I think it's important for all of these customers to know we're there for them if they need the additional help.",William Angrick,4393645
,,,,
14523,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. Good. And then just a couple more, if I may. It looks like -- because you didn't give us Q4 numbers broken out, but kind of back of the envelope, it looks like your operating expenses were running at about $28 million versus $33 million last year. In terms of what we're expecting for next -- for this fiscal year, obviously, there's going to be some increase. But is there any kind of big increase that we're looking at? Or is it just kind of move in proportion to what the top line and the GMV growth will be?",Gary Prestopino,4393645
,,,,
14524,Question-and-Answer,"Well, there have been operating efficiencies captured as we've completed some of our integration work. So we're not going to see step function growth in things like technology or ERP integration type work. That's behind us. Where we are spending more money, Gary, is in the sales and marketing organizations to take advantage of this window of opportunity in fiscal '21. ",William Angrick,4393645
,,,,
14525,Question-and-Answer,"We just continue to see all of these macro trends where there is a need in the marketplace for reliable digital solutions to manage and sell equipment and inventory. And that's in any major industry you look at. For example, biopharma and health care. That business grew extremely strongly in the last quarter. There's a global surge in research and development, partly sponsored by Operation Warp Speed to develop vaccines and other cures. And all of that test and measurement equipment, that major R&D expense is a leading indicator to what ultimately flows into our marketplace. ",William Angrick,4393645
,,,,
14526,Question-and-Answer,"And so we want to be -- other examples, in the energy supply chain, continually it's rebalancing this opportunity there. The continued technology innovation in the automotive and transportation supply chain is resulting in a lot of equipment becoming available in those markets that need to be sold. And we just think that the sales and marketing investment is appropriate as we have such a huge opportunity in the future to grow in line with these macro trends.",William Angrick,4393645
,,,,
14527,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. I guess what I'm getting at is just the -- maybe I could ask the question another way. I mean the Q4 numbers reflect people taken back on furlough and et cetera, things like that. It looks like last year, at this time, your first 2 quarters, you spent about $19 million, almost $20 million on sales and marketing. So given that -- those numbers, I mean, you're still looking at an increment above those numbers for fiscal '21. Just trying to get a guide as to how we should look at some of these expenses going forward.",Gary Prestopino,4393645
,,,,
14528,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, I think there'll be some incremental growth in sales and marketing spend.",William Angrick,4393645
,,,,
14529,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. Okay. That's fine. That's all I wanted. Then lastly, can you tell us maybe how -- in terms of how the different businesses have evolved and changed, as we look at the quarters, it used to be that your Q1 or your -- Q1 was your second strongest, your Q2 was your first strongest and then Q3, Q4. Has that really changed that much in terms of your anticipation of how the year would be -- would put out in terms of GMV generation?",Gary Prestopino,4393645
,,,,
14530,Question-and-Answer,"Well, I'll just give a broad set of observations and Jorge can respond to any specific questions on the guide. We're giving guidance this quarter because we have the benefit of a lot of that baked into the 3 months ended December 31. It's hard to say in 2021 and whether these historical patterns will repeat themselves because there's just so many exogenous factors. You have -- what is the people's willingness to take a vaccine, a newly developed vaccine, and policymakers to line up behind that and go back to sort of the traditional economic activity, remove restrictions around travel, remove restrictions around sort of the access to manufacturing facilities and government facilities. That's sort of the biggest contingency that's out there. ",William Angrick,4393645
,,,,
14531,Question-and-Answer,,William Angrick,4393645
,,,,
14532,Question-and-Answer,"Normally, we would see a strong post-holiday seasonal return period. January is obviously slow, but things pick up as you move essentially from January through the July time frame. In a traditional year, Gary, those are strong periods, and then a little slowdown in August. So I think what our goal is, I'm talking about the things that we can do, our goal is to have a very robust sales and marketing apparatus that's continually looking to pick up share that will override seasonality in the business. That's our goal.",William Angrick,4393645
,,,,
14533,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. Okay. And then lastly and then I'll jump off. When you talk about this $1 billion of GMV goal, is it reasonable to assume that you could get there in 5 years?",Gary Prestopino,4393645
,,,,
14534,Question-and-Answer,"I would hope so. I would hope so. I think you look at the TAMs and you look at our penetration and the glide path that we're on to have relevant solutions, to be able to make a compelling case for those prospects to come to a digital solution, we feel very good about the value that we're creating for our customers and that being a very solid target for us, Gary.",William Angrick,4393645

14536,Presentation,Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to your Cantel First Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for your questions and comments following the presentation. [Operator Instructions],Operator,4393632

14537,Presentation,"At this time, it is my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host Matt Micowski, Vice President of FP&A and Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours.",Operator,4393632
,,,,
14538,Presentation,"Good morning, everyone. On today's call we have Chuck Diker, Chairman of the Board; George Fotiades, Chief Executive Officer; Peter Clifford, President and Chief Operating Officer; Seth Yellin, Executive Vice President and Chief Growth Officer; Shaun Blakeman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Capone, Senior Vice President, Corporate Controller and Chief Accounting Officer.",Matt Micowski,4393632
,,,,
14539,Presentation,"Earlier this morning the company issued a press release announcing the financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. In addition, we have posted a supplemental presentation to complement today?s call. This presentation along with reconciliations of non-GAAP references can be found on Cantel?s website in the Investor Relations section under Presentations.",Matt Micowski,4393632

Reconciliations of these financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measurements are provided in today?s earnings press release.",Matt Micowski,4393632
,,,,
14541,Presentation,"With that said, I?ll now turn the call over to George.",Matt Micowski,4393632
,,,,
14542,Presentation,"Thank you, Matt. Our performance in the first quarter demonstrated the unique nature and relevance of our infection, prevention and control offering and the strength of Cantel?s operating discipline. Most importantly we continued our steadfast focus on employee safety which has yielded uninterrupted service to customers. What's clear from the external data and our own results is that we are outperforming the recovery and procedures.",George Fotiades,4393632
,,,,
14543,Presentation,"We estimate based on independent third-party data that in our first quarter through October 31, US endoscopy procedures were down about 6% to 8% below a year ago. During the same time Cantel consumable and chemistry products were flat to up low single digits versus year ago depending on the category. ",George Fotiades,4393632
,,,,
14544,Presentation,"Similarly, and down while US procedures appear to be down 15% to 20% year-over-year, our dental business was up nearly 2% organically reflecting similar outperformance versus the underlying market.",George Fotiades,4393632
,,,,
14545,Presentation,"We are experiencing more revenue per procedure as a result of our strength in PPE, the uptake in our new products and the adoption of heightened infection prevention protocols utilizing more of our solutions. Over the last eight months we have embedded a disciplined operating focus into the company. At the time of the Hu-Friedy acquisition we know we would eventually bring our dental business to a 25% EBITDA margin given first the traditional margin profile of the legacy Hu-Friedy business.",George Fotiades,4393632
,,,,
14546,Presentation,,George Fotiades,4393632
,,,,
14547,Presentation,"Second the impact of synergies, and third, specific operating improvements and the legacy Crosstex business. But as demonstrated this quarter, this has happened on an accelerated timetable especially with the quicker recovery in procedures.",George Fotiades,4393632
,,,,
14548,Presentation,"Here is a key takeaway. This operating discipline is in place across all of our businesses. We are making progress on several other fronts. Peter, will talk about our early traction with Cantel 2.0 initiatives. Our new product launches with SCOPE BUDDY PLUS tubing sets and the DEFENDO cleaning adapter valve have generated momentum. Hu-Friedy launched a new ergonomic scalar just as their manual scalars have seen renewed preference versus ultrasonic scalars to minimize risk of aerosol production in the dental office.",George Fotiades,4393632
,,,,
14549,Presentation,"Yesterday, we announced a collaboration with Censis Technologies the innovative leader in surgical instrument and asset management systems. This will be a significant impetus to enhancing and scaling up our track and trace and workflow technology solutions in the endoscopy suite with a premiere partner. Shaun will speak to how our operating performance and disciplined working capital management is generating strong cash performance.",George Fotiades,4393632
,,,,
14550,Presentation,We have accelerated our debt repayments over the past few months. Earlier this month we paid down our revolver by an additional $50 million bringing our total debt pay down to $125 million thus far in fiscal 2021 and we expect to continue to pursue this accelerated repayment path in 2021.,George Fotiades,4393632
,,,,
14551,Presentation,"I know we will be asked what elective procedure volumes and revenue performance looks like in our second quarter. So far November the first month of the quarter performed similar to October in terms of day rate revenue in medical and dental. As we pointed out on our last call, the second quarter does have four fewer shipping days than the first quarter. As for the rest of the quarter it's wait and see.",George Fotiades,4393632
,,,,
14552,Presentation,"We all see the same headlines. What we do know is that as we exit the winter months and calendar year 2021 unfolds, we are expecting to gradually see 100% recovery in procedures particularly as vaccination programs gain traction. We also know regardless of exactly what level procedures are at that we continue to perform better than procedure levels given our comprehensive offering and the critical nature of the solutions we bring to our customers.",George Fotiades,4393632
,,,,
14553,Presentation,Last quarter we gave guidance on EBITDAS margin exiting the year. We said at least 19%. We are updating this guidance to at least 22% EBITDAS margin exiting our fourth quarter.,George Fotiades,4393632
,,,,
14554,Presentation,"Now, given Q1 EBITDAS margin of just under 26% this guidance of at least 22% models in a return to normalized operating expense spending in the upcoming quarters. Our performance this quarter demonstrates the earnings power of our businesses when volumes return to normal levels. The enhanced operating discipline we have deployed coupled with the strength of our suite of infection prevention and control solutions, and recent traction in our Cantel 2.0 programs, gives us confidence in our ability to sustain these operating levels and continue to build on them in the future. So, with that Shaun?",George Fotiades,4393632
,,,,
14555,Presentation,"Thanks, George, and good morning everyone. I'm going to go through our key financial results with brief commentary. Following that I'd like to provide additional details that give context to the financial results during COVID. Of course, the standard reported financial details are available in the earnings deck for you to follow along, and we can cover any additional questions you may have during the question-and-answer session.",Shaun Blakeman,4393632
,,,,
14556,Presentation,Net sales increased 15.5% year-over-year in the first quarter of 2021 versus prior year and 14.7% on a constant currency basis. M&A accounted for 16.5% of the increase and the FX impact of 0.8%. Both of which were offset by an organic decline of negative 1.8%. This significantly exceeded our Q1 expectations with procedural volumes and demand for infection prevention products in both medical and dental accelerating throughout the first quarter.,Shaun Blakeman,4393632
,,,,
14557,Presentation,,Shaun Blakeman,4393632
,,,,
14558,Presentation,"The Medical segment decreased by negative 2.2% on an organic basis in the quarter. Capital equipment decreased 20% with recurring revenue increasing 2% in the period versus the prior year. It is important to note that while capital sales declined, we build robust backlog during the quarter, representing strong underlying demand. While underlying endoscopy procedures have returned faster than anticipated, our outperformance and our recurring revenue categories above procedural growth indicate market share gains we are seeing with our differentiated infection prevention offering.",Shaun Blakeman,4393632
,,,,
14559,Presentation,"The dental segment grew 65.1% on a reported basis driven by the acquisition of Hu-Friedy and increased 1.8% on an organic basis primarily driven by the recovery of dental procedures combined with increased demand for infection prevention products in the dental market, inclusive of PPE and disinfecting chemistries. Overall, we believe these results reflect the power of the combined Hu-Friedy Group portfolio especially in an environment of increasing sensitivity to infection prevention protocols.",Shaun Blakeman,4393632
,,,,
14560,Presentation,Life Sciences declined 7.3% on an organic basis primarily due to lower portable reverse osmosis machine sales. This decrease was primarily driven by demand in the back half of the fiscal year 2020 as customers requested these units during the height of the pandemic. In the Dialysis segment we saw organic growth of 8.3%.,Shaun Blakeman,4393632
,,,,
14561,Presentation,"Turning to consolidated margins our GAAP gross margin increased by 460 basis points to 49.6% versus 45% in our first Q 2020, while non-GAAP gross margins increased by 280 basis points year-over-year to 51.1%. The expansion was driven by the return of volumes combined with our more disciplined approach in managing manufacturing costs as well as favorable mix due to the higher sales of consumable products. More Importantly at this volume we believe we should sustain gross margin expansion going forward.",Shaun Blakeman,4393632
,,,,
14562,Presentation,"Moving down to our profit, GAAP of profit increased 249.1% year-over-year to $50.4 million. On a non-GAAP basis our profit increased 52% year-over-year to $64.5 million. Our cost discipline around discretionary spend of ongoing and we will continue to take a cautious approach with OpEx given the uncertainty surrounding COVID. I expect OpEx to remain relatively flat sequentially in our second quarter on the lower end of the $85 million to $90 million guided previously and stabilizing around $90 million to $95 million run rate by Q4 depending on volumes.",Shaun Blakeman,4393632
,,,,
14563,Presentation,"Moving on to tax rates the GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 28.2% as compared to the prior year rate of 33.8%. This decrease was driven by lower permanent item in the US and favorable geographic income tax. The non-GAAP effective tax rate came in at 25% compared to the prior year rate of 25.9%. The decrease was driven by geographic income mix. As a result, GAAP earnings per share increased 307.1% year-over-year to $0.57. Non-GAAP earnings per share increased 38.5% year-over-year to $0.90. Finally adjusted EBITDA came in at $76.3 million up 48.6% year-over-year.",Shaun Blakeman,4393632
,,,,
14564,Presentation,"I will now move on to the key cash flow and balance sheet items. Cash flow from operations for the quarter came in at $62 million an increase of 594.3% year-over-year and we ended the quarter with $258 million in cash. Working capital decreased 9% sequentially to $426.9 million sequentially to $426.9 million primarily driven by a decline in cash-on-hand which was used to repay some of our revolver. Accounts receivable increased 7%, inventory declined 2% and accounts payable increased 12%, all of that on sequential basis. In addition, CapEx was $5.5 million this quarter which also decreased sequentially.",Shaun Blakeman,4393632
,,,,
14565,Presentation,"Gross debt end of the quarter at $1.384 billion while net debt was $780.4 million. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 3.93 times. As a reminder we were able to pay down $75 million of our revolver in September. A key element of our Cantel 2.0 initiatives has been to drive operating and working capital improvements. Our heightened operating discipline coupled with the full implementation of SAP in the US is driving greater insight into our operating metrics, enabling us to better manage our business. We will continue to drive operating efficiency and expect to continue to pay down additional debt in fiscal year 2021.",Shaun Blakeman,4393632
,,,,
14566,Presentation,,Shaun Blakeman,4393632
,,,,
14567,Presentation,"During the last call we mentioned our intent to pay down at least $125 million in the fiscal year. Given our stronger than expected performance and cash position through the first quarter we were able to pay down an incremental $50 million of our revolver in November bringing our total debt pay down to $125 million, completed four months into our fiscal year.",Shaun Blakeman,4393632
,,,,
14568,Presentation,"With our strong operating cash flows, we anticipate paying down an additional $55 million to $75 million of debt during the remainder of the fiscal year. Although we still feel it's prudent to refrain from providing guidance for the full year, I'd like to provide some color on the second quarter. In terms of revenue, it?s important to remember that we have four less shipping days in our second quarter due to the winter holiday season which we would expect to impact the medical and dental business to the tune of approximately $3.8 million per day. In addition, due to normal seasonality tied to the dental school business, you should assume there is a $5 million seasonal demand in our dental segment in the first quarter that will repeat in the second quarter.",Shaun Blakeman,4393632
,,,,
14569,Presentation,"Finally, given the increase in COVID spread across the globe, we anticipate the procedures will continue to stay in line with the past few months until the pandemic starts to become more controllable. As a reminder, we will be filing our 10-Q by the end of this week. I'll now hand it over to Peter to provide a few operational updates.",Shaun Blakeman,4393632
,,,,
14570,Presentation,"Thanks, John. And good morning, everyone. I wanted to take the time to share some insight into what we've learned over the past 90 days. These observations have and will continue to impact the actions that we've taken near and long term to execute on our strategy. At the forefront of the changes that we see is that the healthcare providers have fundamentally changed their IP&C protocols in a permanent way. These new protocols are allowing procedure capacity to safely recover faster than anticipated in most geographies.",Peter Clifford,4393632
,,,,
14571,Presentation,"Our products, services, clinical expertise, education and training are providing differentiated solutions to enhance patient safety and efficiency of practice for our customers. The procedures we support, often considered elective, are critical to hospital, ASC and dental suite profitability. And as we head into the winter season, we anticipate that healthcare providers will protect and sustain these procedures differently than what was experienced this past spring. The demand for more IP&C solutions and stronger compliance to existing standards, highlights the critical nature of Cantel's solutions, which are enabling us to outperform procedure volumes and gain share in our medical and dental segments.",Peter Clifford,4393632
,,,,
14572,Presentation,"Our assessment of procedures during 1Q 2021 place dental procedures in the range of 80% to 85% of pre-COVID levels were medical procedures were approximately 90% to 95% of pre-COVID levels. While this is positive news, we do expect patient?s safety concerns to be higher over the next several weeks regardless of any potential near-term impact due to COVID we are bullish on what we believe the market environment for our products and solutions will look like in the spring with or without a COVID vaccine.",Peter Clifford,4393632
,,,,
14573,Presentation,"It is worth noting that through November, our daily order intake rates have continued to outpace sales in both medical and dental. This trend along with the operating enhancements that we've made over the past nine months bolsters our confidence in the future. While there is much to do, we know how to manage what is in our control including our cost structure, discretionary spending, working capital, debt service and taking care of our employees during challenging times.",Peter Clifford,4393632
,,,,
14574,Presentation,Moving to Cantel 2.0 and starting now with our US medical commercial initiatives in the ASC space we have launched what we termed spring training for 1H 2021 on schedule. Critical activities that we have focused on in 1Q 2021 that will continue through 2Q 2021 all ASC sales reps will complete their basic and advanced training courses on selling the full bag by the end of 2Q 2021 driving targeted equipment placement program wins across this segment of the market.,Peter Clifford,4393632
,,,,
14575,Presentation,,Peter Clifford,4393632
,,,,
14576,Presentation,"We are already seeing traction in the market related to these initiatives to put our 1Q 2021 efforts into context through the fourth month we have already matched our full year 2020 pipeline and our outpacing placements. Executing infection prevention efficiency reviews in the ASC clinics, which is key to establishing our brand and value proposition while generating actionable VOC insights and significant positive feedback from an underserved market. Refining our field sales toolkit by improving our value selling calculators better designed programs and promotions strengthening our clinical education materials all aimed at crystallizing our value proposition.",Peter Clifford,4393632
,,,,
14577,Presentation,We are very encouraged by the early feedback from ASC practitioners regarding our ability to effectively capture the value from the solutions that we provide. In addition to the progress made in ASCs we have concurrently accelerated our plans in the hospital setting with positive results. Some of the key light highlights include field reps of all completed their advanced full bag training courses to remind you we recently configured our medical sales organization from product specialists to full bag reps to better sell the full Cantel portfolio.,Peter Clifford,4393632
,,,,
14578,Presentation,Our force US insight sales team is now fully operational and closed their first orders in October. This is an initiative that will take time to develop what we think is a must have given the access issues that continue to impact the provider landscape due to COVID. New capital programs have been incredibly successful doubling our normal backlog to $14 million at the end of 1Q 2021.,Peter Clifford,4393632
,,,,
14579,Presentation,Our continued investment in the key account director or KAD program has given us a unique advantage given its IP&C educational nature allowing our teams unprecedented access even as facilities have lockdown. To give some perspective on the traction of the KAD program initiatives we have seen faster than average growth in these accounts with approximately 30% higher organic consumable growth compared to accounts not partnered with a KAD program.,Peter Clifford,4393632
,,,,
14580,Presentation,"Needless to say, that our programs in the US are in full swing and progressing nicely. In Europe, we continue to gain traction in our commercial excellence initiatives. In terms of our people, nearly all of our reps have completed their full back training coursework that has been deployed throughout the US team, with a focus on consumables. This training will be bringing them in line with standards we have set for our US team.",Peter Clifford,4393632

14581,Presentation,We've put new processes and programs in place resulting in early wins this past quarter where we outperformed procedures by double digits in terms of recurring revenue streams. We anticipate that these results will continue to strengthen as our initiatives become standard work over the next couple of quarters.,Peter Clifford,4393632
,,,,
14582,Presentation,"In dental, we have executed on numerous initiatives ahead of schedule that have positively impacted the quarter. Out-the-door sales from distributors to customers remain robust in most categories of double digits with PPE and back to practice kits leading the way. Clinical education and training has been a unique strategy for a dental segment providing IP&C guidance along with our core infection prevention portfolio to pull through incremental revenue as clinics get back to more normal operations. In terms of core operations, we?ve made significant headwind preparation of our SAP go-live, which we expect to occur in the spring, further simplifying the business.",Peter Clifford,4393632
,,,,
14583,Presentation,"As I wrap up now, I want to highlight the significant achievement that was mentioned earlier in the call, we initially released a synergy target when we acquired Hu-Friedy that it was number we expect it to be. We are pleased to report that we have already exceeded our year three target by accelerating the execution of cost synergies between the legacy businesses. This execution has enabled us to exceed our two to three year target of approximately 25% plus EBITDAS ahead of ahead of schedule.",Peter Clifford,4393632
,,,,
14584,Presentation,,Peter Clifford,4393632
,,,,
14585,Presentation,"Moving over to R&D, we continue to make traction with our launch of both the SCOPE BUDDY PLUS and Defendo cleaning adapter valve with both franchises gaining share, an attractive margin categories. Specifically, in SCOPE BUDDY PLUS, we penetrated 250 customer accounts in the first quarter driving approximately $5 million in both capital and consumable revenue. In DCA, we are targeting our largest [ph] scope customers first and have seen approximately 15% penetration during the first quarter.",Peter Clifford,4393632
,,,,
14586,Presentation,"Finally, I'd like to provide an update on our project to add mask capacity globally. We have received our first two mask machines into our Rochester facility and should have them up and running during the month of December. We are expecting to receive our next two machines into our Italian facility in December and have them certified an up and running in February. The last four machines should be in place by May to June timeframe in Rochester.",Peter Clifford,4393632
,,,,
14587,Presentation,"As I mentioned on the last call due to government subsidies, we will be able to significantly increase our mask capacity while expending very little in terms of net CapEx. I want to take this time to thank our global employees for their extraordinary efforts this quarter and what has been a challenging backdrop. We have over 2,400 team members who go out into the field and come in every day to produce and support our key products and solutions to enable our customers to continue providing care in a safe environment. It is through this hard work and commitment in a difficult environment that we are able to achieve our mission and we are grateful for their contributions.",Peter Clifford,4393632
,,,,
14588,Presentation,I'm now going to hand back to George for closing remarks.,Peter Clifford,4393632
,,,,
14589,Presentation,"Thanks, Peter. Before we get into questions and answers, I have a short leadership change for your reference. Many of you have come to know Matt Micowski as the face of Investor Relations for Cantel. Over the past few years, Matt has done an extraordinary job managing both the FP&A function along with Investor Relations. In keeping with our guiding principles of continuous development for employees, Matt has accepted a segment CFO role within the company and has already begun the process of transitioning his responsibilities.",George Fotiades,4393632
,,,,
14590,Presentation,"Matt has been instrumental in the development of Investor Relations within Cantel and we would like to thank him for his contributions. With that, Investor Relations will be formally transitioning to Ryan Lada. Ryan was previously the CFO of our Medical segment and brings strong internal knowledge in the business and financial acumen to the role. We expect to continue to make introductions over the next few weeks. Please note to contact Ryan for your Investor Relations and queries going forward.",George Fotiades,4393632
,,,,
14591,Presentation,"Let me sum up by saying that the key takeaway for this past quarter is that we are delivering on execution. Execution and continued share gains for our infection prevention and control solutions and our markets and execution with respect to operating discipline and cash management. So, as procedures continue their recovery in 2021, we're confident in the sustainability of our stronger profitability performance.",George Fotiades,4393632
,,,,
14592,Presentation,"Okay. So, with that we?re now ready for questions.",George Fotiades,4393632
,,,,
14593,Question-and-Answer,[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question today from Matthew Mishan with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.,Operator,4393632
,,,,
14594,Question-and-Answer,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you very much for all the information and outstanding quarter as you kind of progressed through all of this. George first I just want to get a sense for how should we think about the transition to normalize spending in your business. I'm just trying to understand what's sustainable on the margin profile here and what is going to be changing over the next several quarters?",Matt Mishan,4393632
,,,,
14595,Question-and-Answer,,Matt Mishan,4393632
,,,,
14596,Question-and-Answer,Sure. I think Shaun and I can tag team this question. So look I think as we pointed out in the remarks. First and foremost the big change or transition that's occurred over the past several weeks months is in the dental business. We said at the outset before the pandemic with the Hu-Friedy acquisition that we felt we could get this combined business of Hu-Friedy cross techs to a 25% EBITDA margin that's obviously happened on an accelerated basis.,Chuck Diker,4393632
,,,,
14597,Question-and-Answer,"Just to remind everybody the legacy Hu-Friedy business was around at 22% EBITDA margin, cross techs had been at 22% EBITDA margin although in fiscal year 2019 it was underperforming and that's obviously has -- has changed a meaningfully in the -- in this year. So, this combined business has gotten to 25% that but we made extraordinary progress on the synergies, obviously the faster recovery and procedures. So, look it's at 30 something percent EBITDA margin the first quarter. We're saying 25% over time. So, obviously the -- the -- the transition and that has to do with the fact that some operating expenses will come back.",Chuck Diker,4393632
,,,,
14598,Question-and-Answer,"When you look at what we said about the overall EBITDA margin exiting the fourth quarter, I said 22% you know we're at EBITDAS that is we're at 26% in the first quarter. So, we've obviously carefully looked across the remaining quarters as -- as procedures recover, what becomes more a normalized operating expense. And look at one thing I can't make more clearer is that we have really spent an awful lot of time embedding a cost discipline and an operating discipline in the company.",Chuck Diker,4393632
,,,,
14599,Question-and-Answer,"It's been certainly helped, but SAP we've almost looked at things on a zero-based budgeting basis to understand what it takes to run the business on a sustainable basis. So, we're very confident and how we have -- how we see the rest of the year unfolding you know provided the recovery and procedures yielding what I said is our goal at the end of the fourth quarter.",Chuck Diker,4393632
,,,,
14600,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. The only thing I would add is that you know to help out with the numbers to point back to kind of briefly what I said in the call that we think OpEx will stay relatively flat going into this quarter and then we're kind of pegging it at $90 million to $95 million a quarter depending on volume. So, again, that's kind of how we get back to 22% that George referenced.",Shaun Blakeman,4393632
,,,,
14601,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. Thank you, Shaun. And then, I wanted to shift over to -- to capital. You know my sense on capital is if it's being underutilized, they tend to spend. And then I want to shift over to capital my sense on capital is if it's being underutilized, they tend to spend -- send less of it, it looks as if the procedures are going to be under a 100% for a period of time. What's driving that the backlog of capital in it? And I think what's interesting is you -- your focus moving to on the ASCs at this point are you kind of hitting these ASCs is at the exact right time as procedures or maybe moving out of the hospital?",Matt Mishan,4393632
,,,,
14602,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah, I'll take that, Matt look first on the capital piece I think we've been assertive let's say in terms of looking at bundles where we can leverage both our cabinet opportunity along what they are so I think that's been quite successful in the last four or five months in both the US and international markets. And then on the ASC front look I think we are hitting it at exactly the right time.",Shaun Blakeman,4393632
,,,,
14603,Question-and-Answer,The VOC has been incredibly strong we jokingly call the first half of the year spring training as -- is really yeah the key changes and strategy deployment we put it in the fourth quarter we kind of said all along at the first half of the year was really refining what we deployed at the end of the year in the first half to start putting points on the board and in the second half and so far as I mentioned in my commentary we've had a lot of success with our EPP programs that's again the equipment placement programs where we bundled consumables to allow folks with maybe constrained capital budgets to bundle where we get advantageous economics but are able to help customers out again it might have some capital constraints to their budgets and as mentioned in the commentary we?ve through four months have got line of sight to really outpace already to the full year fiscal 2020 capital deployment in four months already so it?s a -- It?s off to a strong start. This is short answer.,Shaun Blakeman,4393632
,,,,
14604,Question-and-Answer,,Shaun Blakeman,4393632
,,,,
14605,Question-and-Answer,"And then last question, I just want to go back to the CADs, I think you said they were -- the areas where you have the CADs, you?re driving 30% higher consumable growth. Just how -- how does -- how does those CADs drive that higher consumable growth? Is it just that high touch relationship and -- and then working with those large customers on -- on infection protocols more closely?",Matt Mishan,4393632
,,,,
14606,Question-and-Answer,Yeah. I think the key is back to that access that we talked about even during the shutdown periods we've maintained on that CAD clinician model pretty steady access. So we've been continually getting in front of IDN groups here over the last five or six months and as you said influencing and changing protocols at different parts during the GI suite and that?s been very effective.,Shaun Blakeman,4393632
,,,,
14607,Question-and-Answer,"Again, as we've talked about the ability to sell tops down as a way to again simplify and ease the bottoms up going from those full bag reps now on the field, on the hospital side. So we had been measuring pretty fanatically here in the last year-and-a-half really the -- the areas where we're seeing growth, where we have CAD coverage, where we don't. And the data is always been compelling and hence why we've continued to increase that investment sequentially from fiscal 2020 to 2021 and going from 10 CADs to 14 CADs this year.",Shaun Blakeman,4393632
,,,,
14608,Question-and-Answer,Okay. So hopefully you guys are modeling spring training after the Yankees and not the Mets. Thanks guys.,Matt Mishan,4393632
,,,,
14609,Question-and-Answer,We'll take our next question from c with Raymond James. Please go ahead.,Operator,4393632
,,,,
14610,Question-and-Answer,"Thanks. Good morning everyone. A couple of questions, I guess George starting, starting with you. Just trying to think through kind of the progress that you made, which has been significant in this quarter as, as you?ve rolled out this, your sort of new platforms and, and selling models et cetera. And clearly, you made the point that your revenue growth is ahead of their procedure recovery.",Larry Keusch,4393632
,,,,
14611,Question-and-Answer,"I'm thinking kind of now post COVID, what's your latest thoughts on, on sort of how we just should think about the organic growth for this company with what you've achieved thus far? What's, what's the right way to kind of start to think about a more normalized organic growth range for the company?",Larry Keusch,4393632
,,,,
14612,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. I think this will sound familiar but I think our confidence level continues to increase. But if you look at the parts, medical, we, endoscopy, I think with the things we're gaining traction on Cantel 2.0 that we could be at 8-plus percent organic revenue growth. Dental, we think 6% growth. And of course, Life Sciences, we?ve sort of modeled it flat.",Shaun Blakeman,4393632
,,,,
14613,Question-and-Answer,"I think again COVID has certainly provided a strong impetus to what we offer to, to the consumers and has sort of reinforced the importance of the complete bundles that we provide in both places. And we, we've talked about the question about what transpires in consumer or customer behavior post COVID. And I think the changes we're seeing are ones that will be, become embedded certainly at the hospital. But even in the ASCs and the dental offices, there will be an expectation on the part of patients that these will continue to be embedded protocols.",Shaun Blakeman,4393632
,,,,
14614,Question-and-Answer,"And importantly, we're spending a lot of time trying to talk about the economy of practice in addition to the IPC efficiency of practice and that?s really the message that we?re -- we were always taking in the tunnel and we?re now taking into ASC so that for the ASCs that they continue to be able to regain where they were in terms of efficiency in practice or the you know their throughput. But now with the protocols that we help them put in place. So I don?t know we feel pretty positive about it.",Shaun Blakeman,4393632
,,,,
14615,Question-and-Answer,I think we you know we as Peter pointed out some of these Cantel 2.0 programs we're starting to refine the KPIs so that we can track this progress. It's still early days with respect to that. But what we're seeing so far is giving us a lot more confidence around where we're going to be coming out of it.,Shaun Blakeman,4393632
,,,,
14616,Question-and-Answer,,Shaun Blakeman,4393632
,,,,
14617,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. That was great. Two other ones, I guess sort of same sort of question again either for Georgia or Sean on EBITDAS margins again as you start to think out particularly given your ability to accelerate that you free synergies again I'm sort of thinking past 2021 and sort of thinking about more 2022 or 2023 you know kind of where do you guys think those EBITDAS margins could head. And secondarily Sean you know what given the operating expense numbers that you've talked about for the 2Q and then as you move into 4Q that $10 million to $15 million that it moves higher from where we are today what's driving that that increase in operating expense? Thanks.",Larry Keusch,4393632
,,,,
14618,Question-and-Answer,I'll start with a simple question about operating expense. And that's primarily you know this can be driven incrementally. It's going to be a lot of it's just going to be discretionary spend. It's still pretty historically low levels around COVID. We don't anticipate all of that will come back but we do anticipate that some of it will come back as we're putting out in terms of kind of the informal guidance and a little bit of headcount would come in to play as well but that's really not a significant driver of the 21 number that's really more just anticipate discretionary spend coming back.,Shaun Blakeman,4393632
,,,,
14619,Question-and-Answer,"But I would also point out Larry that's also like the lever for us as well in terms of being able to preserve margins going forward. Yes, George?s point we have quite a bit of confidence in our ability to operate even in good times and turbulence to maintain that.",Shaun Blakeman,4393632
,,,,
14620,Question-and-Answer,"As far as going past 2021 I know this is one of our favorite topics, but yeah, I think it's even relevant answering it in terms of 2021 in particular around the gross margin expansion that we do have a lot of confidence even net of mix that at these volumes and normalize for those volumes that, we are driving meaningful margin expansion like our operating discipline and with the culture that we've been driving during the pandemic if we didn't let go to waste. So, I think it?s would be our target if you will informally to continue to try to look like that approximately 50 basis point expansion year-over-year going forward in our operating margins.",Shaun Blakeman,4393632
,,,,
14621,Question-and-Answer,Great.,Larry Keusch,4393632
,,,,
14622,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. I think we obviously we've not spent a lot of time talking about what happens two or three years from today yet, but although sort of understanding our growth rates. But look, we said 22% in the fourth quarter. And so, that's a good starting point for next fiscal year as we continue to make progress in Europe and build the business in Europe obviously that helps improve profitability.",Shaun Blakeman,4393632
,,,,
14623,Question-and-Answer,"So, I would say beyond fiscal year 2021 -- as we get into fiscal year 2022 excuse me getting into fiscal year 2023 we should pick up another 100 basis points or so in that progress. So, I think look our goal is to ultimately get to 24% to 25%. And obviously this year with what's transpired in the Hu-Friedy -- the Hu-Friedy acquisition and the synergies and basically a reset and how we look at our operating expense.",Shaun Blakeman,4393632
,,,,
14624,Question-and-Answer,And also I should add to because this is an important point we've done a lot of things that we promised would transpire and you'll benefit like SAP implementation for example and some things we've done in rooftop consolidations that are paying benefit now as well they were obscured at the outset of the pandemic obviously with the revenues but I think those are other things that are starting to improve as well.,Shaun Blakeman,4393632
,,,,
14625,Question-and-Answer,We'll take our next question from Mike Matson with Needham & Company. Please go ahead sir.,Operator,4393632
,,,,
14626,Question-and-Answer,Yeah. Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess I just wanted to ask about the ASC setting so can you maybe talk about the biggest opportunities there is it really around the procedural products and care minus what the penetration of the procedural products is in that setting?,Mike Matson,4393632
,,,,
14627,Question-and-Answer,,Mike Matson,4393632
,,,,
14628,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah I'll help with that Mike so look just from a share or positioning there just to remind folks again we own about 50% of the AER installed base in ASCs and our best view on proxy for sort of let's call it the valve business on the ASC side as because we think that market is only penetrated by 15% so look I think as we?ve -- again it's early days three, four months in but I think we are really, really excited about we see opportunities across the board whether it?s on the capital side of AERs and further in our share position to making headway on penetrating the cabinet side of the business as well as a whole host of other products like products like SCOPE BUDDY PLUS with the 2% consumables on the back side as well as the valve business and -- and obviously we see opportunities for chemistry business as well on the ASC side, so.",Chuck Diker,4393632
,,,,
14629,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then, the capacity expansion you're doing for, for masks, how confident are you that the demand will still be there by the time you get done with that given the timing around the vaccines being administered kind of hopefully by the middle of next year?",Mike Matson,4393632
,,,,
14630,Question-and-Answer,"I think our premise, there was, look, the capacity was nearly free, net of the subsidies from the government. So, that's the first point is, look, we don't have to pay a whole lot to get basically in a position to double our mass capacity. Well, you know, we used to have about $190 million to $200 million a year of mass capacity and that's roughly going to double over time.",Chuck Diker,4393632
,,,,
14631,Question-and-Answer,"But certainly, look, we think there are protocols that have permanently changed as, or at least adherence to those protocols that aren't going to go back. And the best example again is, is on the dental side where look, the protocols have been there that, that hygienists and dentists should be changing their mask after every patient. And the reality is before COVID, that really wasn't always the case.",Chuck Diker,4393632
,,,,
14632,Question-and-Answer,"You might have a practitioner that changed their mask at lunch and then again at the end of the day. And I think there's been far greater adherence to changing your mask after every patient. And I think that sticks so as an example I mean that that's a doubling or tripling of the requirements on the dental side as we see that being permanent. So, we do see opportunities to utilize that capacity on the dental side. And look, I think it also gives us an opportunity to be opportunistic in other markets where we might be able to bundle products together.",Chuck Diker,4393632
,,,,
14633,Question-and-Answer,We'll take our next question from Larry Solow with CJS Securities. Please go ahead.,Operator,4393632
,,,,
14634,Question-and-Answer,"Great. Good morning, guys. Thanks for you know certainly a lot of information. Could you just clarify, so on the clearly you know -- you've beat sort of every line item between you know a little bit higher sales on your preannouncement and then you know certainly much greater gross margin expansion. And it sounds like your targets and your EBITDA exiting the year at 22% versus 19%, is most of that adjustment you know related to your confidence and -- and sort of achieving these -- these higher gross margin levels and then the operating margin and expense level there's some room there and you know maybe there is -- if you don't bring back all those expenses you know you'll potentially have some more upside? Is that a fair way to look at it?",Larry Solow,4393632
,,,,
14635,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. I would say the -- it is overall I'd say the you know major changes are you know previously we had kind of anticipated that procedural recovery would be somewhere between you know 90% to 95% by the end of the year. And so, we're more bullish. That's going to be you know at a 100% by the end of the year. So, that's driving some of that confidence and the expansion that we you know referenced.",Chuck Diker,4393632
,,,,
14636,Question-and-Answer,,Chuck Diker,4393632
,,,,
14637,Question-and-Answer,"And yes, absolutely that you know we're -- we're getting more confident in our ability to you know produce the fruits that we knew that we were planting you know with all the operational initiatives that we had in place. And -- and again, I think you -- you know reiterated like I've seen a spot on that you know there is room in that you know client that I've referenced in the operating expense models so that again you know if volumes fluctuate of any you know and you know off of anything that we forecast right, we do have room to pull those levers to maintain margin.",Chuck Diker,4393632
,,,,
14638,Question-and-Answer,Yeah. I don't have anything to add like suppose you know that?s -- we've used the word at least 22% strength to our confidence.,Shaun Blakeman,4393632
,,,,
14639,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah, no, absolutely. And how do you gauge or balance your significant outperformance in revenue or rebound in recovery and revenue versus sort of obviously a nice recovery in procedures but not quite the level that you have revenues recovered. Is there some catch-up or like these returned to work, it's and maybe perhaps now that that providers plan on using extra PPE and stuff, are they perhaps buying even extra inventory and stuff? How do you sort of gauge that catch-up or is there maybe not as much as I'm thinking there is?",Larry Solow,4393632
,,,,
14640,Question-and-Answer,Yeah. Larry this is Peter. One of the things obviously with the dental side is we have a lot of data on out of the door by product category and obviously?,Peter Clifford,4393632
,,,,
14641,Question-and-Answer,Right.,Larry Solow,4393632
,,,,
14642,Question-and-Answer,"Compared to that to our purchases from our channel partners. And we've looked at both on, I'll call it, a calendar year-to-date 2020 and also just during our first quarter of fiscal 2021 the amount of inventory change has been negligible. So, the reality is, and that's a good news story for us that there isn't any, there isn?t some big restocking going on there then what our channel partners are buying as what's going out the door.",Peter Clifford,4393632
,,,,
14643,Question-and-Answer,"And on the medical side as well, I mean, the nuance that you have to remember especially on the consumable side is a lot of these hospitals and a lot of the VACs don't hold a lot of inventory because they don't have a lot of space to hold inventory. So, you're talking about a change where maybe somebody is holding a couple of days that may be holding a week, week and a half. So, the reality is we just don't see that behavior happening within our core markets. And look, I think at the end of the day, we're seeing that dollar per procedure increases as people again are just paying more attention to the protocols and the importance behind it.",Peter Clifford,4393632
,,,,
14644,Question-and-Answer,"Right. And you mentioned you know I know Europe expansion improve in -- Europe it is part of Cantel 2.0, I mean are you seeing any differences today in the recovery forget the COVID and since which it seems to be worse in the US but just in terms of the customer behavior and whatnot in the United States versus the rest of the world are there any differences as we sort of begin to rebound?",Larry Solow,4393632
,,,,
14645,Question-and-Answer,No I mean it's been broad-based in the sense of I -- meaning we've seen examples in every geography where there are certain practitioners that are adhering or in some cases creating new standards and again the example is we've seen pockets in Germany we've seen pockets in the United States and Australia with an -- as an example where we sell 24-hour tube sets and we've seen some clients actually switch that to a single-use tube sets as an example with just the heightened focus on the infection prevention around COVID.,Chuck Diker,4393632
,,,,
14646,Question-and-Answer,Okay. Just I guess perhaps the last question or so maybe a little color on the -- you announced this deal with CANEXIS on the Trace & Tracker just to review this as sort of on an early-stage thing that eventually will contribute meaningful revenue but sort of a slow ground or how should we sort of look at that?,Larry Solow,4393632
,,,,
14647,Question-and-Answer,,Larry Solow,4393632
,,,,
14648,Question-and-Answer,"Hi. Hi, Larry this is Seth we're really encouraged with the partnership that we announced with CANEXIS. We've always viewed Track & Trace solution as an important additional element to our overall complete circle of protection That ties together the overall nature of the portfolio. And we're very encouraged by the ability to leverage the strength of our partner to help accelerate this offering in to the market. Obviously, these are substantial investments at hospital system is going to make. So, they're not quick sales and quick win.",Seth Yellin,4393632
,,,,
14649,Question-and-Answer,All right.,Larry Solow,4393632
,,,,
14650,Question-and-Answer,"But we have a healthy pipeline and we're encouraged by the interest that we've seen from our customer level, demand for this sort of solution and we look to roll this out with the develop product in the coming quarters and we anticipate this will be a growth driver for us in fiscal 2022 and beyond.",Seth Yellin,4393632
,,,,
14651,Question-and-Answer,"Great. Okay. Great. Just lastly, I'd be remiss if I didn't just give a shout out to Matt, he helped me out a lot ramping up. So, good luck in your new role. And that's it. I'm all set. Thanks guys.",Larry Solow,4393632
,,,,
14652,Question-and-Answer,And that's not going to influence this page though.,Seth Yellin,4393632
,,,,
14653,Question-and-Answer,We'll take our next question from Mitra Ramgopal with Sidoti. Please go ahead.,Operator,4393632
,,,,
14654,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. The first one to start on Hu-Friedy obviously you're well ahead in terms of your targets on the costs synergy side. I was just curious as it relates to on cross selling front, if you're generating incremental revenue there that you anticipated or if you're already ahead on that front also?",Mitra Ramgopal,4393632
,,,,
14655,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah, Mitra. This is Peter. Yeah, I mean look the back to practice procedural kits on the dental side that we've been bundling a fair amount of Hu-Friedy with prospects as those dental offices reopen. So that's got a pretty big win. But yeah, candidly the growth drivers are still the same. Yeah. The IMS setups are progressing although was new build facilities have obviously slowed with COVID. But those are compliance bundles the Harmony scalar we just launched in the month of October.",Peter Clifford,4393632
,,,,
14656,Question-and-Answer,"So we've got minimal sales in October what we're excited about what that brings the rest of the year. Obviously, that surface disinfectants along about what that brings in the rest of the year. Obviously, the surface disinfectants along with PPE has been huge and then we continue to lean into green light as a key store issuance vehicle to move the whole business forward.",Peter Clifford,4393632
,,,,
14657,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. No. That?s great. Thanks. And as it relates to the facemask, face shields et cetera, just wondering if you have any restrictions given the federal subsidies in terms of being able to sell more outside of the US?",Mitra Ramgopal,4393632
,,,,
14658,Question-and-Answer,"No. There is, there's minimal handcuffs on that. We just need to keep the capital. Actually, in the United States, it?s pretty much the main requirement on the machines that on the foreign machines that we got assistance from the US government on. And it's a similar profile on the two machines that we got in Italy. We need to maintain the capital there, but we can manufacture and export as much product as we need to.",Peter Clifford,4393632
,,,,
14659,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. That's great. And as it really say, I believe you mentioned we should be expecting some incremental headcount coming on as you go to business. Where do you stand on the sales force front especially given the increasing push into ASCs and just building up the business going forward?",Mitra Ramgopal,4393632
,,,,
14660,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. I mean even during the shutdown here, we protected the investment on the sales side especially on the medical piece so we are staff now. I think as we've mentioned in the opening remarks, we're down. Basically, there's one open position on the inside sales. But we've got that up and running in the first quarter. That team got their first orders in the month of October.",Chuck Diker,4393632
,,,,
14661,Question-and-Answer,,Chuck Diker,4393632
,,,,
14662,Question-and-Answer,"We're fully staffed on the ASC side in the eight markets that we targeted. And we've made really strong progress in getting everybody that was put into a full background trained sort of graduating, from getting their masters and selling both capital and procedural products here. So, if you really get there, we?re positioned as we hit the back half of the year, we've got not only a highly motivated sales team, but no open positions. And everybody again trained and ready to roll.",Chuck Diker,4393632
,,,,
14663,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. Thanks. And then finally on Life Sciences, a little later than I was looking for. What is your best sense in terms of when you expect that to sort of flatten out?",Mitra Ramgopal,4393632
,,,,
14664,Question-and-Answer,"Look, it's fairly flat sequentially from 4Q to 1Q and I would look at the next two quarters and probably say revenue is going to look pretty close to the first quarter in terms of sort of trading sideways, from a revenue perspective we've seen the backlog kind of stabilize and level off. This is usually the slowest time of the year, November and December from an order intake perspective on Centrals.",Chuck Diker,4393632
,,,,
14665,Question-and-Answer,As you can imagine there's not lots of folks wanting to go do new builds in the middle of the winter. So for us usually the order intake machine starts to accelerate late January. And that's kind of how we see the market is orders that we take in February and March because of the lead time we're not going to shut until the late spring or early summer. And so that's probably how we think about sort of the revenue trajectory.,Chuck Diker,4393632
,,,,
14666,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. Thanks. And then finally just one housekeeping question. I believe on the interest expense line I think there was an item that was included in there, some non-cash interest expense. I was just wondering what that amount was if you had it.",Mitra Ramgopal,4393632
,,,,
14667,Question-and-Answer,Little less than I think about what $1.8 million or so and escalated to the accounting for the convertibles. It's a non-cash item to give to your point.,Chuck Diker,4393632
,,,,
14668,Question-and-Answer,Okay. Okay. Perfect. Thanks again for taking the questions.,Mitra Ramgopal,4393632
,,,,
14669,Question-and-Answer,We'll take our next question from Michael Cherny with Bank of America. Please go ahead.,Operator,4393632
,,,,
14670,Question-and-Answer,"Thanks so much. One just quick clarification Shaun, you mentioned your expected gross margin expansion to continue. Just wanted to know is that off of the 1Q levels or is this based off of last year and expecting year-over-year gross margin expansion?",Michael Cherny,4393632
,,,,
14671,Question-and-Answer,"It will be in reference and the best quarter again would be our second quarter of 2020 looking at a set of the whole with Hu-Friedy employees, so it would be reference to that, I mean, obviously Q1 itself there is a little bit of mix so you know in terms of the capital versus consumables mix that you know will alter going forward. But you know relative to those volumes and mix we do expect the margin expansion year-over-year.",Chuck Diker,4393632
,,,,
14672,Question-and-Answer,Mike we refer to since our fiscal year 2020 second quarter because it was the last pre-COVID?,Peter Clifford,4393632
,,,,
14673,Question-and-Answer,That rate to be clear it was like 47?,Michael Cherny,4393632
,,,,
14674,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah, it was 47.1. So you know again if you want to think about in general we'd be targeting around 50 basis points expansion on top of that maybe a little bit better that would be a good way to think about it.",Chuck Diker,4393632
,,,,
14675,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. That's a very helpful clarification. And then I guess maybe the pull on the mass question and the PPE dynamic, infection prevention you're doing in the dental markets as dentists continue to think about reformatting their workflows. You gave some color around how much they can switch out masks. How much are they coming to you in terms of having that strategic discussion to make sure that they're appropriately sourced especially at a time where you know there is -- there are some other mask manufacturers that have high levels of quality but you're also fighting a battle of third party black market whatever you want to call it challenges and how early whether it's mask or some other PPE. Can you get into those conversations to make it more strategic type sales versus some of the rest demand that you're likely still seeing across the market?",Michael Cherny,4393632
,,,,
14676,Question-and-Answer,,Michael Cherny,4393632
,,,,
14677,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah, that's a good question Michael. I mean look we are having those conversations with the larger channel partners. You can think of it as almost getting into a position where ultimately have dedicated machines And capacity that that -- that folks are definitely thinking about how they saw strategically differently than they used to much -- much in the last five to 10 years has been just get the cheapest product and obviously there?s been a sea change on that in terms of people want to make sure that they?ve got multiple sources and ideally multiple sources what capacity in North America and not getting caught again from an exposure perspective where the entire supply chain that they are buying from was in APAC. So know we do think there are opportunities to bundle long-term and enter long-term relationships and commitments on mask and face shields specifically.",Chuck Diker,4393632
,,,,
14678,Question-and-Answer,If I could just one more follow-up that I apologize but I missed this before. Can you give us a sense of dynamics within that area of pricing that you've seen across your customer base?,Michael Cherny,4393632
,,,,
14679,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. I mean ultimately we only changed our pricing once a year so there isn't that the channel partners obviously are able to change their pricing real time to the -- to the market which I'm sure that they've done. If we've gotten any real benefit I think I would -- I would categorize it is as we have pushed our branded mask very heavily. Obviously the pricing and the margin profile is a bit higher on the branded versus private label. So from our perspective, our main benefit is really insisting or pushing more forcefully here the branded product.",Chuck Diker,4393632
,,,,
14680,Question-and-Answer,"And this concludes our question-and-answer session. George, we?ll turn the floor back to you now for final remarks.",Operator,4393632

14688,Presentation,"And now, I?ll turn the call over to Mike Huseby.",Andy Milevoj,4393631
,,,,
14689,Presentation,"Thanks, Andy, and thank you all for joining us this morning. During the past few months we've seen a vastly different college experience take place nationwide. Our campus partners have adapted to a fall semester. It looks very different than in years past. Between navigating the late start dates introducing blended learning format implementing widespread student testing and more colleges and universities adjusted as best they could to the ongoing challenges that COVID-19 pandemic continues to present. Through all of this BNED has been able to pivot accordingly ensuring that our customers receive uninterrupted service no matter where, when or how their learning took place this fall.",Mike Huseby,4393631
,,,,
14690,Presentation,As we have highlighted since the onset of this pandemic the strategic investments we have made in our digital offerings e-commerce solutions warehouse operations and campus stores have uniquely positioned us to offer the flexible and adaptable solutions that institutions students and faculty need.,Mike Huseby,4393631
,,,,
14691,Presentation,Over the past few years we have introduced solutions such as our BNC First Day model and the BNC Adoption and Insight Portal to drive convenience for students and administrators and respond to institutions increased emphasis on affordability access and achievement. We have also developed a new digital offerings such as our bartleby suite of services to ensure students have access to 24/7 academic support.,Mike Huseby,4393631
,,,,
14692,Presentation,"Coupled with our virtual bookstores dropship offerings and fulfillment capabilities powered by our MBS subsidiary, BNED has created an unmatched value proposition which we believe has become only more relevant in light of the challenges this pandemic has presented for institutions. It is because of this that we have continued to attract new clients and generate new business growth $93 million in new business today this fiscal year or $71 million on a net basis.",Mike Huseby,4393631
,,,,
14693,Presentation,,Mike Huseby,4393631
,,,,
14694,Presentation,"With that being said, we are continuing to experience the impacts of the pandemic in other areas of our business and are adjusting and adapting accordingly. As anticipated, we experienced substantially lower general merchandise sales this quarter, which significantly impacted our profitability given the relatively high margins of our GM business. Our second quarter traditionally sees higher general merchandise sales due to athletic events many of which were either completely canceled or took place in a reduced capacity this fall. Our field team has done a tremendous job managing expenses to help mitigate these declines, which Tom will discuss in further detail.",Mike Huseby,4393631
,,,,
14695,Presentation,"Compared to our expectations, textbooks performed relatively well particularly considering many students did not have the traditional on-campus experience or did not attend on-campus classes at all. Textbook sales declined 19% for the quarter as compared to 7.7% decline in the prior year period. Because of substantially reduced foot traffic on campus and in our campus stores due to pandemic restrictions, eCommerce remains an important and accelerated sales channel for us.",Mike Huseby,4393631
,,,,
14696,Presentation,"We continue to see a large percentage of shoppers purchasing their textbooks and general merchandise on our bookstore website. eCommerce sales represented 66% of our total Q2 sales as compared to just 36% in the prior year. We have made continued progress in the development of our new eCommerce platform this quarter. This exciting platform will provide a hyper personal, hyper local shopping experience for customers.",Mike Huseby,4393631
,,,,
14697,Presentation,"We continue to see growth and momentum of our First Day and First Day Complete inclusive access programs, which has become even more relevant institutions in light of the current learning environment. At a time when many things remain uncertain, our First Day offerings enable schools to provide a more affordable and highly convenient model that ensures students receive their course materials and are ready to learn by the first day of class. This is more critical now than ever.",Mike Huseby,4393631
,,,,
14698,Presentation,"At the start of the fall semester, we successfully launched First Day Complete in 12 campuses and we expect to implement the program at additional campuses for the start of the spring semester. As we look ahead to next fall, we are in deep discussions with a significant number of our campus partners about transitioning to First Day Complete as they look to take advantage of the benefits of our -- in all inclusive model to enhance access affordability and student academic achievement.",Mike Huseby,4393631
,,,,
14699,Presentation,As we continue to support our campus partners to our bookstore operations and course material offerings we also continue to serve students directly through our DSS segment. The demand for bartleby?s homework health solutions has recently exploded. October 2020 was our highest traffic month ever with approximately 4 million unique visitors in the month up 378% versus last year and up almost 80% versus spring peak traffic.,Mike Huseby,4393631
,,,,
14700,Presentation,"We are focused on scaling this business in a quality manner that will lead to sustainable subscriber growth. Bartleby?s potential to add significant shareholder value to BNED is truly exciting. The rapid emergence and persistence of online and blended learning format only strengthens the need for this digital solution. This past quarter we saw continued demand for our bartleby products from a student?s reserve. Bartleby gross subscribers grew to over 120,000 with revenue increasing 53%.",Mike Huseby,4393631
,,,,
14701,Presentation,"On a year-on-date basis subscriber growth is up over 40%. Because fewer students are on campus right now, we have seen a smaller percentage of bartleby sales taking place through our in-store channel and while our store teams are still putting great effort into selling their customers, we've also increased our focus on other sales and marketing channels to ensure that bartleby is available to as many students as possible. This includes SEO which has continuously seen our expectations in driving users to bartleby remains a core aspect of our growth strategy.",Mike Huseby,4393631
,,,,
14702,Presentation,,Mike Huseby,4393631
,,,,
14703,Presentation,"Additionally during the second quarter we entered into a partnership with Blackboard a leading ed-tech company to offer our bartleby solutions in their newly launched Blackboard assist feature. Blackboard assist is a feature, within Blackboard learning management system that enables higher ed students to search and access academic support services from their institutions as well as from curated third-party tutoring and homework tools such as bartleby right within their LMS.",Mike Huseby,4393631
,,,,
14704,Presentation,Bartleby will offer two products through Blackboard Assist in the United States. Bartleby Help and Bartleby Write . Bartleby Help is the institutionally branded version of our Bartleby Learn product which provides asynchronous online tutoring from experts who are available 24/7. We are very excited about this new partnership and expanded distribution it provides for our bartleby suite of services in the United States. Blackboard Learn is a leading global learning management system in the US and serves millions of students many of whom are outside of the BNED footprint.,Mike Huseby,4393631
,,,,
14705,Presentation,"We believe that partnerships such as this one and VitalSource, will allow us to grow brand awareness for bartleby in turn driving increased subscriptions and revenue. As we look to further scale our Bartleby suite of solutions, we will continue to explore additional partnerships such as this one, which will allow us to scale at faster rates. This was obviously a very unique fall rush for our stores, for students, for faculty and for our campus partners.",Mike Huseby,4393631
,,,,
14706,Presentation,"With the focus on the health and safety of our people and communities, our stores resumed operations on campuses, where it was deemed safe to do so this fall. Supporting customers with safety measures such as mobile curbside pickup, contactless payments and socially distant store layouts. We are immensely proud of our teams for the ways in which they have adapted to change these past few months.",Mike Huseby,4393631
,,,,
14707,Presentation,"One of our biggest strength as a company lies in the relationships we have on campuses nationwide. Our partners, students and faculty rely upon us for best-in-class service and even in the midst of a global pandemic, we have been able to continue delivering just that. As we've noted previously, we continue to expect COVID-19 to impact our business throughout this fiscal 2021. In response, we have substantially adapted our cost structure and continue to take actions to reduce costs and operate more efficiently in this environment. We will remain vigilant and highly focused on managing expenses and liquidity prudently.",Mike Huseby,4393631
,,,,
14708,Presentation,"I would like to take this opportunity to once again thank all of our campus partners and our people at BNED, their tireless efforts throughout these challenging times. Even as we have had to adapt to difficult circumstances, our teams have continued to make significant progress on our goals and I'm very proud of the ways in which they?ve all continued to innovate and move forward. With that, I will turn it over to Tom for the financial review.",Mike Huseby,4393631
,,,,
14709,Presentation,"Thanks, Mike. Please note that our fiscal 2021 second quarter ended on October 31, 2020 and consisted of 13 weeks. All comparisons will be to the prior-year period unless otherwise noted. Total sales for the quarter were $595.5 million compared with $772.2 million in the prior year. This decrease of $176.7 million, or 22.9%, was comprised of $165.2 million decrease from the retail segment, a $3.8 million decrease from the wholesale segment and a $0.7 million increase from the DSS segment. BNED?s fiscal 2021 second quarter results were significantly impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic as many schools continued to adjust their learning model and significantly reduced their on-campus activities in response to the pandemic.",Tom Donohue,4393631
,,,,
14710,Presentation,"While many big conferences resume their sporting activities, fan attendance was either eliminated or severely restricted which had a substantial impact on the company's high-margin general merchandise business. Sales were also affected by overall enrollment declines which were further exacerbated by the decline of international students who either studied online or deferred their studies as a result of the pandemic. Retail comparable store sales declined 28.1% during the quarter comprised of a 19% decline in textbook sales and a 52% decline in our general merchandise business.",Tom Donohue,4393631
,,,,
14711,Presentation,,Tom Donohue,4393631
,,,,
14712,Presentation,"Our general merchandise business which includes clothing and food, and relies on store traffic throughout the semester was far more impacted by the reduction of students, on campus and the elimination of a campus social events and sporting events. These declines were partially mitigated by BNC?s rapidly growing First Day offerings, which incorporate course material fees into students? tuition fees and grew 77% to $53.4 million during the quarter. Net sales for the Wholesale segment decreased $3.8 million or 9.5% to $36.4 million, primarily due to decreased gross sales, partially offset by lower returns and allowances.",Tom Donohue,4393631
,,,,
14713,Presentation,"DSS sales grew $0.7 million or 14% to $5.9 million, benefiting from the growth in Bartleby subscriptions and our Student Brands business. Bartleby subscriptions revenue increased 53% to $1.7 million, while Student Brands? revenue increased 3.8% to $4.3 million. The consolidated gross margin rate for the quarter was 19.4% compared to 24.2% in the prior year period. This decrease was primarily due to the shift to lower margin digital courseware and lower sales of our higher margin general merchandise products, coupled with higher markdowns. This is partially offset by our efforts to negotiate lower contract costs.",Tom Donohue,4393631
,,,,
14714,Presentation,"In anticipation of the challenging sales environment, we continue to prudently manage payroll and store operating expenses. These actions coupled with the cost reduction actions taken in fiscal 2020 enabled us to reduce selling and administrative expenses by $21.4 million or 18.9% compared with the prior year period. As we look ahead to the spring rush period, we anticipate that schools will continue to prioritize the health and safety of their faculty and students and continue to adjust their learning models in response to the pandemic.",Tom Donohue,4393631
,,,,
14715,Presentation,We expect that they will continue to restrict on campus social events including sporting events to reduce crowds and follow COVID-19 safety protocols. We remain committed to serving our partners how I really choose to resume learning and we'll continue to prudently manage expenses and liquidity in light of the lower sales environment. Due to all the uncertainty that COVID presents in the near and intermediate term we are not providing fiscal 2021 guidance. We do expect that COVID will continue to have a significant impact on our business during fiscal 2021.,Tom Donohue,4393631
,,,,
14716,Presentation,"At the end of the quarter our cash balance was $7.4 million with outstanding borrowings of $99.5 million as compared to $24.6 million of cash and no borrowings in the prior year period. This difference is directly the result of the lower sales environment we are experiencing, but better than our own expectations. Our current liquidity position remains strong despite the challenging climate.",Tom Donohue,4393631
,,,,
14717,Presentation,"CapEx for the second quarter was $9.1 million compared with $10.9 million in the prior year. Currently, our retail segment operates 1,439 college, university and K-12 school bookstores comprised of 768 physical bookstores in their e-commerce sites as well as 671 virtual bookstores. As of today we have contracts to open an additional nine stores in fiscal 2021 with one additional known closing primarily of the smaller unprofitable store. This will bring our total physical and virtual store count to 1,447 locations net of closed stores.",Tom Donohue,4393631
,,,,
14718,Presentation,"With that, we open the call for questions. Operator, please provide instructions for those interested in asking the question.",Tom Donohue,4393631
,,,,
14719,Question-and-Answer,[Operator Instructions] And your first question here comes from the line of Ryan MacDonald from Needham. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.,Operator,4393631
,,,,
14720,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Congrats on a nice quarter here during challenging times. As you started to look towards the spring semester, I think there's a recent New York Times article that discussed that a number of universities are expecting more students on campus this coming spring. Just would be curious to hear sort of how that compares to the conversations you're having with your university partners and how you're approaching sort of inventory building as we get to the spring semester here?",Ryan MacDonald,4393631
,,,,
14721,Question-and-Answer,,Ryan MacDonald,4393631
,,,,
14722,Question-and-Answer,"Hey Ryan, it's Mike. I'll give a general answer and then let Lisa Malat, President of our B&N College Operations jump it. Obviously, it's very hard to predict what's going to happen because as we saw in the [indiscernible] on how COVID moves and how well it gets controlled, we saw today the first vaccines are starting, but how fast will they get rolled out, et cetera.",Mike Huseby,4393631
,,,,
14723,Question-and-Answer,We still have a number of schools that is different by geography as you saw in California that many of the schools are state schools decided to go full remote. That was fairly unusual. Many other schools went hybrid in the fall and those that didn't go hybrid and went full on-campus some ended up having to change their plans.,Mike Huseby,4393631
,,,,
14724,Question-and-Answer,I think the same thing as a risk of happening in the spring although now that the schools have been through a full semester of this adaptation and there's going to be a relatively long break for most schools between Thanksgiving and many schools business students other than to have finals taken virtually for the winter break to be fairly long break there. So I'll let Lisa talk about what we're actually hearing from our campus partners so we can address your question.,Mike Huseby,4393631
,,,,
14725,Question-and-Answer,"Sure. Good morning, Ryan. I saw that article as well and immediately reached out to our field vice presidents just to make sure that we had the latest insights on what's happening on campus. I mean Mike?s right, it is very geography driven. The trend we are seeing is that schools are pushing their openings. Right. They're not opening till mid-January or late January. We heard that yesterday as an example for Yale and Kentucky. Pretty universally, they're canceling spring breaks. Obviously they don't want students leaving campus, come back to campus et cetera.",Lisa Malat,4393631
,,,,
14726,Question-and-Answer,So there are many universities that are not making a definitive decision in terms of what's going to happen later on in this spring but this trend has gotten up later opening and the cancellation of the spring breaks. Our expectation is that learning will continue to be driven remotely at this time.,Lisa Malat,4393631
,,,,
14727,Question-and-Answer,"Maybe Tom can answer your question on the spend, inventory spend.",Mike Huseby,4393631
,,,,
14728,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. Thanks. This is Tom, Ryan. Our intention and plan has always been to not be ahead of what we see in sales. So to the extent that the sales aren't coming, we're not going to be ahead of ourselves on the inventory and we'll continue to manage that prudently and really manage to the campus activities that we see in terms of the activities and the events that to this point in time have really been non-existent.",Tom Donohue,4393631
,,,,
14729,Question-and-Answer,"You can see that -- the comments on the scripts, this comes in the script that we are with an increasing percentage of sales going to e-commerce which is fairly obvious as to why, not only e-commerce from our own fulfillment but we instituted drop ship capabilities of general merchandise and many of our general merchandise partners and that's increasing. So that, that helps us in the context of being able to fulfill and also the breadth of the selection that our customers can get it. These are orders that are being filled directly by manufacturers through the common subject drop ship system.",Mike Huseby,4393631
,,,,
14730,Question-and-Answer,"Thanks for that direction and it leads right into my next question nicely around e-commerce. It's great to see sort of the materially increasing percentage of merchandise sales coming from e-commerce. Can you talk about what your expectations for the space rollout of the new platform on, as you get into calendar 2021 and perhaps what's really potentially constraining or preventing on a university term from really rolling that out and implementing it more quickly?",Ryan MacDonald,4393631
,,,,
14731,Question-and-Answer,"Jon Shar, can you address that question.",Mike Huseby,4393631
,,,,
14732,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. Yeah. Hey, Ryan. It's Jonathan Shar. Again our plan is to continue our developments and have a phased rollout of our new e-commerce platform starting after the spring rush and then how that phased throughout and have that implemented prior to fall rush for our next fiscal year.",Unidentified Company Representative,4393631
,,,,
14733,Question-and-Answer,,Unidentified Company Representative,4393631
,,,,
14734,Question-and-Answer,Excellent. And I guess on the?,Ryan MacDonald,4393631
,,,,
14735,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. And in terms of the and answering your question about what's preventing any time you put in a new e-commerce system particularly under these circumstances you want to make sure that we do things on a very customized basis for each school. So this isn?t flipping a switch. We have 770 or so microsites and so that we have begun to roll it out, it's not a flipping a switch type of an exercise and it's very customized.",Mike Huseby,4393631
,,,,
14736,Question-and-Answer,"So, I think it's a very cooperative process between us and the school. So, to answer your question directly some of it will depend on the resources that the schools devote and some of it depends on us making sure that as we're scaling this we're doing it in a way that optimizes the transition from the old system to the new system.",Mike Huseby,4393631
,,,,
14737,Question-and-Answer,"Excellent. And just one last one from me, I'll jump back in the queue. On first day and first day complete great to see 12 implementations during the semester, as you look at sort of expectations for additional roll out in the spring, what are your expectations in terms of number of universities or maybe a comparison order of magnitude compared to the fall and how?s the pipeline looking for fall 2021? Thanks.",Ryan MacDonald,4393631
,,,,
14738,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. Hey, it's Jonathan again. Yeah for spring, we are and we thought and we've announced publicly that Sam Houston State University is launching for spring term which from an enrollment standpoint will be our largest campus implementing first take complete and then -- and we haven't properly communicated what the other schools would be for spring but looking ahead the pipeline as noted in the script is really robust.",Jonathan Shar,4393631
,,,,
14739,Question-and-Answer,We are in deep discussions with a significant number of campus partners about transitioning to the model and the benefits of the whole inclusive model and the access affordability and achieving an overall convenience is even more relevant today. So we're really excited about the number of conversations and the opportunity to really show significant growth in First Day Complete for next fiscal year and really starting with fall term in 2021.,Jonathan Shar,4393631
,,,,
14740,Question-and-Answer,"The other thing, this is Mike. The other thing I would add to that is that as we said we had a $93 million of new business thus far this year in fiscal 2021 and as we're doing that we're having these conversations with the new schools on First Day Complete.",Mike Huseby,4393631
,,,,
14741,Question-and-Answer,"We're trying to target our efforts towards those schools to have an open mind towards inclusive access and -- in First Day Complete that does it mean all the schools will do that that we're picking up business schools, but that's an important point because it validates -- the new business that we're selling validates our overall model which is things are more complicated for schools. They have more of an emphasis on managing the fiscal aspects of their business and because they share every dollar that we produce under our contracts with them, they're very incentivized to outsource to us.",Mike Huseby,4393631
,,,,
14742,Question-and-Answer,So the model -- the overall business model within Barnes Noble College has been validated by the new business as well as the move to First Day and First Day Complete and by the way and with our very recent conversations with the top management of large publishers and in general they're very committed to inclusive access as a way to grow their digital businesses which is important to us.,Mike Huseby,4393631
,,,,
14743,Question-and-Answer,Your next question comes from the line of Alex Fuhrman with Craig-Hallum Capital. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.,Operator,4393631
,,,,
14744,Question-and-Answer,"Great. Thanks very much for taking my questions. I'd love if we could take a step back for a sec as you think about planning for next year and years to come. As you engage with your partner schools and look at potential new contracts, do you feel that universities are still envisioning the campus bookstore as a central community space? Can you talk about maybe how that might look different after the pandemic or the same as it has been before 2020?",Alex Fuhrman,4393631
,,,,
14745,Question-and-Answer,,Alex Fuhrman,4393631
,,,,
14746,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah let me handle that. I think my overall comment would be that as I just said many of the reasons that we're growing our new business have to do with the complexities of not just content procurement, but also retailing and I think one of the things we really bring to the table, is we strengthen in the retail experience within the stores we expect that to continue and as I've said in the past I personally believe and this is our corporate view, this is not necessarily supportable by fact, but there's going to be quite a pendulum swing back to students and others who are interested in learnings getting back to social distance, while they will be careful in certain respects, I think that there is going to be a real urge to get back together and spend time physically, which we're not necessarily planning our business Alex to return to physical store traffic levels of fiscal year '19 and the fall of next year, I don't think that would be smart but we're expecting the overall community hub feel of our stores to continue and maybe even more important than even given what's changed prior over the course of last year, but we think we can?",Mike Huseby,4393631
,,,,
14747,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. What you said is exactly right. Alex, as we go to market, it?s really too key really value prop for us, it's obviously affordability and what we're able to do to drive that through digital and First Day Complete etcetera. But the other is really our expertise and prowess as a retailer and our ability to build community to drive traffic to celebrate the school brand and to drive revenue right.",Lisa Malat,4393631
,,,,
14748,Question-and-Answer,"And we recently did a de-brief Alex of around 12 of our schools recently signed schools to understand what drove their decision and how did we differentiate in the marketplace and working through so loud and clear and all of those responses was our ability to drive community and to create that dynamic community space not just for the students, but obviously for parents alumni, but also in more of the retail community locations to bring in the outside community into the store. So universities are very, very focused on making sure that the student experience continues to evolve and that we remain really a central hub on campus.",Lisa Malat,4393631
,,,,
14749,Question-and-Answer,"Great. That's really helpful. And then you're just thinking about the numbers real a little bit, what are some of the things that you're going to be looking towards over the next few months and quarters as you make the decision to start bringing some expenses back and personnel back or are there kind of signposts that you're going to be looking for over the next semester or two as you start to make those decisions?",Alex Fuhrman,4393631
,,,,
14750,Question-and-Answer,"Well, all that?s tied into our planning for spring and beyond obviously is you?re inferring and we've done a very painful but I would say great job of managing costs and costs related to the payroll and other costs and other capital spend and that started as soon as the pandemic hit we furloughed almost 11,000 people. And then we've been bringing people back into stores. Primarily, we're talking about Barnes Noble College in terms of this question because MBS has been running three shifts 24x7 since COVID hit given their assets and their ability to satisfy virtual and remote learning requirements and probably the same thing and they're exploding in terms of their growth right now.",Mike Huseby,4393631
,,,,
14751,Question-and-Answer,"So the Barnes Noble College is really the focal point in terms of expense management because that's where most of the costs are and that's where most of the challenges. And so what we're planning -- excuse me what we're planning on is doing the same thing that we've done which has been very flexible and changing our cost structure, so that much more of it is variable as opposed to fixed.",Mike Huseby,4393631
,,,,
14752,Question-and-Answer,"We have changed the mix of our full-time employees with the mix of our seasonal and tougher employees and we changed, Tom can get into this to explain in a little more detail, but our objective is to maintain that change in our cost structure which allows us to be much more nimble and reactive quite frankly on a short-term basis which is once we get news from various schools how are we able to staff and accommodate and at the same time use technology to try to reduce payroll costs, but as you may what you may want to comment further on this.",Mike Huseby,4393631
,,,,
14753,Question-and-Answer,,Mike Huseby,4393631
,,,,
14754,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. No thanks, Mike. I was hitting some of the guide posts that we're thinking of generally revolve around the activities or what we've been experienced with a lack of activities on campus, but the severely restricted or non-existent fans at football games and the likes, we're heading into obviously basketball season, one of the NCAA tournament look like, so as these events and social events start returning more than normal I think that's some of the guideposts we're thinking of, as we consider some of the expense items that you're referring to, but we?ll make it pretty well in terms of how we've adjusted the model and this is really attributable to the college team and the field staff on how we switch from a longer standing full time employees to more temporary seasonal and that's helped to reduce costs significantly.",Jonathan Shar,4393631
,,,,
14755,Question-and-Answer,"I think the other unknown and I wouldn't call it a guidepost necessarily but as the vaccine progress which I don't think they have enough information on yet, you can even form your own speculation based on all the information that -- that?s out there. I mean that we are starting to see the actual roll out of the vaccine and that?s not just how does it impact students, but how does it impact faculty who are concerned, will they get the vaccines earlier that, that we don't know the answers to those questions but what it does look like from the early reports even listening to you around this morning from the healthcare experts is that the vaccines do look like they're effective and thus far I mean the clinical files, I mean and that et cetera. So that's a big thing that we'll keep our eye on and every school is keeping their eye on. And I'm sure it's going to be pushing to get their faculty and the administration involved in [indiscernible]",Mike Huseby,4393631
,,,,
14756,Question-and-Answer,"Terrific. Well, you guys have done a great job managing through this year and I appreciate all the answers. Thanks.",Alex Fuhrman,4393631
,,,,
14757,Question-and-Answer,[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Maureen Wallace [indiscernible] Capital. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.,Operator,4393631
,,,,
14758,Question-and-Answer,"Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the strong results. I just wanted to follow-up on bartleby where I think you mentioned Mike 378% increase in your monthly unique and up 80% in Spring. I was just trying to square that with the growth in revenues which I assume that maybe you were getting higher conversion rates on the in-store traffic last year and that's why the revenue is not growing quite as fast, but I just want a higher level sense of how you think the price performing in the marketplace and also any ways that you see to enhance the product and distribute it more broadly?",Unidentified Analyst,4393631
,,,,
14759,Question-and-Answer,"That's a question I could spend a lot of time on because I?ve been spending a lot of time personally with team which you know did a wonderful job getting us to this point and has built a really strong team within DSS, lots of further opportunities at the end of November. So I've been spending a lot of time with that team and to give you a short answer I guess first off, in terms of how does it square with revenue and how does it relate to the in-store really what you're asking is what did the sub look like that is sold through our POS system in-store versus the great growth we've had, much of which has come from our long term SEO strategy and in Q&A in particular, we?ve taxable solutions with Q&A in terms of home work in Q&A is just literally exploding.",Mike Huseby,4393631
,,,,
14760,Question-and-Answer,"I mean we?re spending a lot of time right now just working on the quality of our responses, the turnaround time in our responses, and all those things that we need to do from a competitive perspective and also a client service perspective to make sure we have a sustainable business and great customer experience.",Mike Huseby,4393631
,,,,
14761,Question-and-Answer,,Mike Huseby,4393631
,,,,
14762,Question-and-Answer,"So what you'll start to see is, you'll start to see because of the technology that the team has put in place will start to see a service of volume of activity we get in, we're prioritizing those questions and that we're getting in daily to make sure we?re answering our paid subscribers first, okay. So this product has been built largely as you know on a model where it?s largely from a functional and our focus hasn?t been on really the financials. It?s really getting the product build, the content put in place and getting everything put in place that we need to offer. That's changing.",Mike Huseby,4393631
,,,,
14763,Question-and-Answer,"We're now focusing more so on as you ask and building the quality of the product to differentiate it. So when we bought Student Brands in 2017, one of the main reasons we brought that company into our family is because they have a tremendous team of people that are ahead of what we think of -- where we think the competition is on artificial intelligence and machine learning. That?s enabling us to sort through volumes of questions that are about three times what we?re expecting on a daily basis as of right now in our plans and to prioritize them using what we call bottle reconnect, it?s basically a router that takes using artificial intelligence and really being able to analyze the source of the question, it allows us to sort of huge amounts of - large amounts of questions, so that we're focusing on paying subscribers and our strong, our strongest prospects for converting questions and answers to more sustainable subscribers.",Mike Huseby,4393631
,,,,
14764,Question-and-Answer,"The LTV associated -- historically, the LTV associated with an in-store sale has been substantially higher than one that we get from an SEO out of a footprint, we call it sale and we have ways that we're working on to close that gap and enhancing the product. I don't really want to get into our specific product roadmap on this kind of a call for competitive reasons. But we have a tremendous team that's working on a lot of things that are not distant objectives that are being worked on and rolled out as we speak whether it's expanding subjects getting a lot more with video and various contacts and that type of thing.",Mike Huseby,4393631
,,,,
14765,Question-and-Answer,"So, you'll see a much more, I think robust product in the very near term from bartleby even though it's performing very well right now in terms of improving its performance on Q&A and textbook solutions. So we're very excited about it. I'm personally very excited about it, because I'm getting the much more involved personally with the team and seeing what a strong team we?re having in DSS and what a great job we?re doing.",Mike Huseby,4393631
,,,,
14766,Question-and-Answer,Yeah. Thanks Mike. And I appreciate that. And I guess dovetailing on that just since you did bring it up I mean I know that you obviously have a great handle on how that's performing and what you're working on. But do you think that there is -- is there an organizational strategy I guess as far as eventually consolidating that under someone else is currently with the company or would you look to potentially make an external hire at some point around managing DSS and bartleby.,Unidentified Analyst,4393631
,,,,
14767,Question-and-Answer,Our objectives with bartleby are to take it to the next level as a business and how we do that and who we?ll do it with we?ll announce when we're ready to do it. So I think we have a plan. I just don't think it makes sense to talk about that until we e have specifics.,Mike Huseby,4393631
,,,,
14768,Question-and-Answer,"Understood. And then as far as First Day, I thought the revenue number was pretty high compared to what I was expecting $53 million and I assume a lot of that is -- the bulk of it is still complete, but is there any sense that you can give us as far as how much of it might be First Day Complete at this stage?",Unidentified Analyst,4393631
,,,,
14769,Question-and-Answer,"We're not going to break those numbers out today. I mean at the end of this fiscal year, we may provide some context on the growth potential. I think what's really exciting about it is the margin expansion. And we have to be a little careful about disclosing those numbers given how new the product is.",Mike Huseby,4393631
,,,,
14770,Question-and-Answer,,Mike Huseby,4393631
,,,,
14771,Question-and-Answer,"We want to make from a competitive perspective and also just I think that inclusive access as an offering and a concept incorporates both First Day and First Day Complete. And until we scale First Day Complete which we expect to do based on the pipeline discussion we heard in a much more substantial way in the fall of next year, I don't think we can look towards breaking those numbers out. I don't think it benefits us right now to do that other than in the context of like Jon's metrics around enrollment for example.",Mike Huseby,4393631
,,,,
14772,Question-and-Answer,The enrollments that we talked about Sam Houston State and the size of that relative to other First Day Complete clients. We're pushing for First Day Complete metrics that really revolve around ? the remoteness of enrollment increase and margin contribution. So I think that yes we'll start to see those numbers highlighted that it will probably be -- probably won't be done this year. I just don't think it makes sense to do that yet.,Mike Huseby,4393631
,,,,
14773,Question-and-Answer,"Sure. Yeah. That makes sense and I guess with the sales motion there being tied strongly to new business which I know Lisa is running, but then as far as what John you've been specifically doing there? Have you been able to I guess sort of staff that sales team up? And are you experimenting with anything new around go-to-market or what you have in place working pretty well?",Unidentified Analyst,4393631
,,,,
14774,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. We've actually have a significant dedicated focus to First Day Complete and communicating the value proposition to both current clients and prospects alike and we have implemented a number of new marketing and -- sales and marketing programs that are doing a really effective job of getting the attention of our campuses to have detailed and substantive conversations on First Day Complete and if the value proposition is -- that it delivers is a priority on many campuses and the good news is , the answer is yes.",Jonathan Shar,4393631
,,,,
14775,Question-and-Answer,"So, we're driving those conversations whereon the pipeline is really, really robust and sort of aligned for a significant growth from a number of institutions. And as Mike said, also the overall enrollment of students within our campuses that will be participating in for stay complete as well as margin contribution.",Jonathan Shar,4393631
,,,,
14776,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. I think John and his team as well as Lisa and the field has done a tremendous job focusing on first day complete. And the marketing and creativity, I don?t want to get into that over the phone in terms of what we?re doing specifically, given the different some of the competitive issues. But they?ve been very creative. We even have certain board members that are getting directly involved because of their backgrounds and their expertise and endorsement of this product which has been effective as well. So we?re pulling out all stops.",Mike Huseby,4393631
,,,,
14777,Question-and-Answer,"I guess I would say in a very thoughtful, but an aggressive way to market that pipeline that we have. And the good news about it is that a lot of the things have been put in place such as the integration with the student information system, which is basically a very simple thing to do. AIP with option insights portal, a lot of these tools that we've produced under Jon?s leadership have been put in place in many of these schools already. So they?re going to first day complete is the next step in the sequence and if not difficult to do.",Mike Huseby,4393631
,,,,
14778,Question-and-Answer,"It?s a heavy lift anytime you go from a conventional part model to a first day complete for a campus the first time you do it. But having these tools in place makes it much simpler and much more productive for the school as well as for us. So there?s been a strategy behind this as you know for the last couple of years in terms of what we?ve been developing and putting into schools in terms of tools to make this the first day complete implementation sequentially fairly, fairly easy to do. It's a logical next step for many of the schools.",Mike Huseby,4393631
,,,,
14779,Question-and-Answer,,Mike Huseby,4393631
,,,,
14780,Question-and-Answer,"Great. Thanks. Thanks a lot both of you. And then I guess for Lisa just on the new business side, the $72 million of net new business year-to-date is a great number. I guess, how are you feeling about the pipeline heading into 2021 and even I guess calendar 2021 in the back half of fiscal 2021?",Unidentified Analyst,4393631
,,,,
14781,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. We're feeling very, very bullish about in the numbers, prove that out our prices up on around $100 million and where it was last year worries, so as everyone has talked about and in the complexity of the industry and the pressure that the schools are under having to make those really tough decisions about cutting academic programs or tenure track faculty is really driving schools to wake up and recognize that they need to operate more like a business and we are in such a position of strength because of our ability to really customize and break apart our models and rebuild them in anyways that the schools need. So I am very, very bullish about the strength of the opportunities and the pipe going into next year.",Mike Huseby,4393631

First, our team deserves all the credit for continued growth and positive performance. Despite the pandemic and changing environment, over 40,000 team members are serving our guests and ensuring our stores have what they need to be there for our communities. Our team is winning together and I'm grateful for their dedication. In addition to being a top convenience retailer, we're a part of the fabric of the communities that we operate in, where we know each other by name and show up for each other when in need.

Today, I'd like to share some areas where Casey's is having a meaningful impact. During the month of September, with the help of our team members and generous guests, we've raised money for over 15 million meals for 58 local food banks in our communities, which has seen increased demand since the onset of the pandemic.",Darren Rebelez,4393624
,,,,
14796,Presentation,"First, we jumpstarted our support with a donation to Feeding America's COVID-19 relief fund in May, and then we integrated it into our annual plan. Through an in-store giving campaign in partnership with Coca-Cola and Feeding America, we funded much needed meals that will feed children and families in our neighborhoods. Then in October, Casey's announced its first ever grant program as part of our Cash for Classrooms initiative. Our work in education focuses on helping local K-12 schools, and the people they serve, students, teachers and families. This grant program is currently in progress. And we look forward to sharing news of the grantees in March.

,,,,
14797,Presentation,"Now, let's discuss the quarter's results. As you?ve seen in our press release, we had a tremendous second quarter. Diluted earnings per share rose 36% to $3 per share. The results for this quarter were quite well balanced, driven by both stronger fuel margin and higher inside sales volumes and profits than a year ago. We also recently announced an agreement for the largest acquisition in our company's history. I'll discuss the Buchanan Energy acquisition a little later. But suffice it to say that we believe it will be a tremendous strategic fit, and we look forward to welcoming the Bucky?s Stores and their employees to the Casey's family.",Darren Rebelez,4393624

,,,,
14799,Presentation,"I would now like to go over the results and share some of our details in each of the categories. During the second quarter, we continued to experience a favorable fuel margin environment. Fuel gross profit was up 45% compared to the prior year with a fuel margin of 35.3 cents per gallon. Same-store gallons sold were down 8.6% compared to prior year due to continued traffic disruption from the pandemic, though we did see sequential improvement from the first quarter. The average retail price of fuel during this period was $2.07 a gallon compared to $2.47 a year ago. Total gallons sold for the quarter were down 6% to 578 million gallons. Our fuel team continues to do a great job driving performance and we're pleased with our fuel results relative to the industry and publicly available information.

14803,Presentation,"Beer and alcohol continue to perform well. We've also experienced growth in both packaged beverages and tobacco due to larger pack size demand, higher Marlboro loyalty redemptions, and improved in-store execution. Total prepared food and fountain sales were down 3% to $289 million in the second quarter. Same-store sales were down 3.6%. The average margin for the quarter was 60.1% versus 60.9% from a year ago. We had sequential sales improvement of 620 basis points versus the first quarter and our margins improved sequentially as well. That being said, this area of our business continues to be the one most impacted by lower guest counts from the pandemic, especially in the morning daypart while many of our guests continue to work from home or deal with virtual schooling arrangements. Bakery and dispensed beverages, especially coffee are the categories most adversely impacted though both showed volume improvements versus the first quarter. ",Darren Rebelez,4393624

,,,,
14806,Presentation,"Thank you, Darren, and good morning. Revenue for the quarter was $2.2 billion, a decline of $272 million, or 11% from the prior year. This was due to the decline in retail sales of fuel of approximately $321 million driven by the lower number of gallons sold and the lower retail price of fuel. Total inside sales were up 5.1% to over $1 billion. Grocery and other merchandise sales increased by $58 million, while sales of prepared food and fountain fell approximately $9 million. Please note that all reported figures are favorably impacted by approximately 2% more stores being operated on a year-over-year basis. ",Steve Bramlage,4393624
,,,,
14807,Presentation,"Just a reminder, that we do not record lottery ticket sales as inside sales. Rather, we record our net commission earned in other. Lottery ticket sales have performed well throughout the pandemic. And if we had recorded them as part of our inside same-store sales, our year-over-year performance in the second quarter would have increased by approximately 100 basis points. Casey's had gross profit, which we define as revenue less costs of goods sold but excluding depreciation and amortization, of $632 million in the second quarter, an increase of nearly $75 million from the prior year. This is primarily attributable to higher fuel and inside gross profit of $63 million and $11 million, respectively. ",Steve Bramlage,4393624
,,,,
14808,Presentation,"Our grocery and other merchandise gross profit increased $19 million, while the prepared food and fountain gross profit declined $8 million.

14809,Presentation,"Inside gross profit margins were 41%. Grocery and other merchandise margins were 33%, which is in line with the prior year. Prepared food and fountain margins were a touch above 60%, a decline of approximately 80 basis points from the prior year. While the margin decline is smaller versus the prior year than what we experienced in the first quarter, we continue to be pressured due to adverse mix and extra waste in this segment more than other areas of the business.

14812,Presentation,"Total operating expenses were up 10% to $410 million. There are several factors driving this increase. First, the increase from operating 38 or 2% more stores than a year ago is $9 million. We also incurred $9 million in incremental incentive compensation due to the company's strong performance. This increase is driven both by short-term incentive plans at both the store and corporate level, along with accounting for previously granted long-term performance-based equity compensation. We also incurred $1 million in expenses related to the Buchanan Energy acquisition, as well as $5 million in COVID-related expenses such as cleaning and sick pay. We are committed to taking care of our team members and guests during these extraordinary times.

14813,Presentation,"While we finished the quarter down 2% in same-store labor hours, our same-store operating expense dollar increase was closer to 4%. As we communicated previously, we plan to add labor to stores as traffic recover. However, we have experienced incremental staffing challenges with respect to COVID-related quarantines and that is driving additional overtime. Furthermore, a July minimum wage increase in Illinois fully impacted our wage structure in the quarter. We will continue to be diligent in monitoring our labor hours at the stores and right-sizing store hours vis--vis traffic patterns, but we do expect to incur additional COVID-related costs in the third quarter that will likely land between Q1 and Q2?s levels of spending.",Steve Bramlage,4393624
,,,,
14814,Presentation,"Interest expense was down 16% to $10.6 million, due primarily to the refinancing of the senior notes that was completed in August. The effective tax rate for the quarter was approximately 24%, comparable to the prior year.

14817,Presentation,"At the December quarterly meeting, the Board of Directors voted to increase the dividend 6% to $0.34 per share. The company generated $86 million in free cash flow in the second quarter, which we define as cash flow from operating activities of $200 million, less purchases of property and equipment of $114 million. This compares to negative $8 million in the prior year and was driven by higher earnings, favorable working capital performance and lower capital spending. ",Steve Bramlage,4393624
,,,,
14818,Presentation,"Capital expenditures were down $27 million from the second quarter a year ago, primarily due to COVID-related delays in construction projects. The company has opened 15 stores so far this year. Our new store pipeline includes 77 sites, of which 23 are under construction. We also have four acquisition stores under agreement in addition to the Buchanan Energy transaction and we continue to believe we will finish the year with approximately 40 newly constructed stores. While we are not providing earnings guidance for the fiscal year, given the ongoing uncertainty around consumer behavior and traffic volumes from COVID-19, there are a few modeling guidelines that we can?t provide for the impacts of the Buchanan Energy transaction, which we continue to expect to close by the end of the calendar year. We expect to incur approximately $10 million in closing-related costs in our third quarter, and that's primarily advisory and legal fees. We also continue to anticipate a one-time non-cash tax expense of $6 million to $7 million that's associated with the revaluation of our deferred tax liabilities on closing due to a change in state income tax apportionment.

14820,Presentation,"Over the next several quarters, we expect to incur an additional $7 million to $10 million in integration-related costs. We expect the transaction will be EBITDA accretive to us in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year, and EPS accretive in our fiscal 2022. We continue to expect to realize $23 million in synergies by the third year on top of the $47 million in acquired LTM EBITDA. As for the financing of the transaction, we anticipate using approximately $250 million to $300 million in cash on hand, raising an approximate $250 million five-year term loan and taking a temporary draw on our revolver for the remainder of the purchase price. As a result, we expect interest expense for the remainder of our fiscal year to be between $25 million to $27 million. Debt-to-EBITDA is expected to be 2.3 times at closing, still leaving us with ample liquidity. ",Steve Bramlage,4393624

,,,,
14823,Presentation,"Thanks, Steve. I'm very happy with the performance of the company throughout the second quarter. Although we remain very confident in our long-term plan, we're cautious in our outlook over the winter months. While the developing news around vaccine progress should give all of us cause for optimism, the reality today is, COVID cases have surged throughout the Midwest. It should also be no surprise that the CDC recommendations on limiting holiday travel and large gatherings, the movement of schools to virtual instruction, and tighter restrictions on many social activities have started to again take a toll on guest traffic.

,,,,
14825,Presentation,"Prepared food remains pressured and is trending down mid-single-digits so far this quarter. Grocery and other merchandise is trending positive mid-single-digits, buoyed by strong tobacco and alcohol sales and continued momentum behind our various merchandising initiatives. We finished the quarter with food restrictions in place at 120 stores. And given the recent surge in cases, it is possible restrictions may increase. Even though the business is seeing a softening in the pace of the recovery we saw in the summer months, I'm still pleased with the progress on our long-term strategic plan. ",Darren Rebelez,4393624
,,,,
14826,Presentation,"We refer to one of the strategic pillars of the plan as being where the guest is. The primary objective of this pillar is to accelerate our store growth, specifically adding 345 stores over the next three years. This pillar received a significant boost after we disclosed our plan to acquire Buchanan Energy a 94 store chain located here in the Midwest. So, stores known as Bucky?s are a perfect strategic fit for Casey's. They're located primarily in Nebraska and Illinois and are situated in markets that we find very attractive. The Bucky?s team has done an outstanding job, locating the stores on busy corners, and they do many things well operationally. Their stores are high volume sites, averaging more than double our fuel volume, while their inside sales are in line with an average Casey's. We believe our pizza will thrive at their stores. Prepared foods is currently only 7% of their inside sales, compared to our mix of 31%. So, there's tremendous opportunity here to grow that portion of their business. We believe our scale and distribution capabilities can also bring significant margin synergies to the business. ",Darren Rebelez,4393624

14828,Presentation,"In addition to the 94 retail stores, the company currently supports a dealer network of 79 stores. These stores are run by independent operators and are supplied fuel by Buchanan Energy via long-term fuel supply agreements. I'm personally very excited to have this new capability here at Casey's, as it gives us greater flexibility with future acquisitions.",Darren Rebelez,4393624
,,,,
14829,Presentation,"I've seen this work successfully firsthand, and it plays well with our strategic objective to accelerate M&A. The purchase price net of tax benefits is $500 million, which represents a 10.6 times EBITDA multiple. We've expect to realize approximately $23 million in synergies from the transaction by the third year, as well as $3 million from newly opened stores that are not included in our current financial performance. All of this will result in a 6.8 times multiple of EBITDA with fully realized run-rate synergies, a price that will allow us to quickly create value for Casey's shareholders. Our balance sheet will remain strong post-close, which will enable us to continue to execute on our strategic plan to accelerate further unit growth. ",Darren Rebelez,4393624

Our Casey's Rewards program recently surpassed 3 million enrolled members, a 17% increase throughout the quarter. The program has effectively supported our private label launch of 2 liter and 20-ounce soft drinks with special offers and promotions.

14834,Presentation,We will now take your questions.,Darren Rebelez,4393624
,,,,
14835,Question-and-Answer,[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Karen Short from Barclays. Your line is now open. ,Operator,4393624
,,,,
14836,Question-and-Answer,"Hi, thanks very much. I just wanted to talk a little bit about operating expense growth versus gross profit dollar growth. So when you back out the COVID and the bonuses as well as Bucky's, it looks like the gap is kind of almost like 4% between the two. So I guess, wondering if that's the right way to think about the gap kind of given the current environment. And then wondering if you could just talk a little bit about how you're thinking about bonuses going forward, or how we should think about it. Was this $9 million like a true-up given the results in the first half? A little color there. And then I had a separate question. ",Karen Short,4393624
,,,,
14837,Question-and-Answer,"Good morning, Karen. This is Steve. I'll start with that. I think the easiest way on the OpEx side is when we -- the increase year-over-year was about $37 million just in terms of total dollars. And when you carve out the new stores, the incentive comp true-up which I'll come back to, COVID and the [Black shirt] [ph] spending, it was about $13 million or so that related to same-store sales operations, which is roughly 4% year-over-year increase. The minimum wage change in Illinois which just causes compression in our system, we don't pay a lot of minimum wage, but it forces everything up, was probably $2 million or so of that $13 million increase. And so we do believe that it was the right thing for us to do to add hours back into the stores. We tried to be clear but that?s what we were going to do as traffic came back into the stores. And there's no doubt that it continues to be a challenging environment for us in terms of just staffing stores because of COVID-related quarantines. When we have an exposure in the store, not only do we have to close the store to clean it, but we then quarantine the staff members that are working in that store, which creates overtime for everybody else. And so that's going to continue going forward. But we certainly will be diligent around making sure our labor hours that we're using in the stores continues to directionally be consistent with the traffic that we're seeing going through the stores. ",Steve Bramlage,4393624
,,,,
14838,Question-and-Answer,,Steve Bramlage,4393624
,,,,
14839,Question-and-Answer,"And then on the incentive compensation, it?s a little bit of a true-up as well as reflective of current performance. So of that $9 million increase, half of it roughly relates to truing up previously granted long-term incentive performance shares. So those would have been from two -- one and two years ago. And then we did make a true-up based on where those were currently trending. The other half would be reflective of truing up the current year estimated bonus program for both the stores and the management team. So for the next two quarters, I think we probably captured most of the long-term equity true-up realistically. But we probably will have incremental -- a little bit of incremental short-term comp in each of the next few quarters, assuming performance continues to remain strong. ",Steve Bramlage,4393624
,,,,
14840,Question-and-Answer,"Okay, that's helpful. And then I was just wondering if you could give a little color on what you're seeing on average ticket for the various buckets. So in store with no loyalty and DoorDash -- versus DoorDash versus just purchasing through your app, not using DoorDash, like holistically. Any color you can give on those three buckets -- three, four buckets? ",Karen Short,4393624
,,,,
14841,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, hi, Karen. This is Darren. I guess I would just say more broadly, what we saw in the quarter was about a 15% increase in average ticket overall. And that was partially offset by reduction in guest traffic of around 10%.",Darren Rebelez,4393624
,,,,
14842,Question-and-Answer,Our next question comes from the line of Ben Bienvenu from Stephens Inc.,Operator,4393624
,,,,
14843,Question-and-Answer,"You've talked about the near-term ebb and flow of traffic and specific to prepared food the ebb and flow there and the layering on of restrictions. But I'm curious as we come out of COVID and life returns to normal, and you see traffic patterns come back to normal, how do you think about using promotions to drive engagement? And particularly if I could tie it into the comments that you made about cheese prices, which I think we look at both spot and futures markets on cheese, it looks like there's an opportunity to capture another lock of pretty attractive cheese prices. How might that enable you to posture around promotions?",Ben Bienvenu,4393624
,,,,
14844,Question-and-Answer,"Well, Ben, certainly, as things start to normalize again, which, by the way, I'm not sure that we would expect to see ?normal? coming back until probably mid next year, next calendar year, depending on the distribution of a vaccine. And so there's still a lot of uncertainty around that piece. But certainly, via our Rewards program, we have the ability to target our promotional activity a little more precisely than maybe we have in the past. So we have some underperforming dayparts in particular in some categories haven't performed as well. And so we would probably be looking to enhance some promotional activities to regenerate those categories.",Darren Rebelez,4393624
,,,,
14845,Question-and-Answer,"With respect to the cheese lock, we do have an opportunity to, at some point maybe lock in some more of our cheese purchasing. We're continuing to monitor the market for the right opportunity to do that. To the extent that we save on cost of goods, we can make a decision as to whether we want to invest some of that savings in promotional activity or not. I would say that that's probably less of a factor in our thinking as opposed to thinking about where the guest is at any particular point in time and what we think is the right offer that's going to resonate with them.",Darren Rebelez,4393624
,,,,
14846,Question-and-Answer,"My second question is related to store growth. I suspect that the reacceleration of store growth might be concurrent with return to normal dynamic and the operating landscape. But I think you highlighted what your store growth is expected to be for this year. Do you think in fiscal '22 you can get back to that historical organic and inorganic growth rate, exclusive of Bucky?s, I know that's going to be a nice boost to your long-term goal, and will pull forward some of that long-term goal. But as it stands right now, how are you thinking about the reacceleration of the store count?",Ben Bienvenu,4393624
,,,,
14847,Question-and-Answer,,Ben Bienvenu,4393624
,,,,
14848,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, at this point, we expect to be able to get back onto the cadence that we were -- that we had originally planned on. The real [indiscernible] on this has just been a general slowdown in municipalities being able to work through the permitting process. And then part and parcel with that is some of the trades and contractors where they may?ve experienced some COVID-related challenges. So that's been a bit of a slowdown. We expect that once we get past all of that, we should be able to resume back to normal. It really hasn't been an internal capacity issue on our ends. So once we think -- or once the environment returns to normal, we expect to be back on track.",Darren Rebelez,4393624
,,,,
14849,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. I would add to that, Ben, I think by the time we exit this fiscal year, our actual run rate of stores that we're constructing will be -- will look very consistent with what we had talked about earlier and what our historical track record has been.",Steve Bramlage,4393624
,,,,
14850,Question-and-Answer,Our next question comes from the line of Bobby Griffin from Raymond James.,Operator,4393624
,,,,
14851,Question-and-Answer,"I guess just I wanted to follow back up on the OpEx side of things as we're getting a few questions about that this morning. But when you think out further to get back into more normalized world where the businesses are comping as you'd expect them to, how are you guys thinking about OpEx growth, either in relation to the new store growth or some type of relation to gross profit growth or inflation? Is there some benchmark that you're going to be targeting against that we should think about to grade the business on?",Bobby Griffin,4393624
,,,,
14852,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. I'll start with that Bobby. When we go back and look at the historical -- what's happened in the past from an OpEx growth standpoint, we've expanded on the same-store basis to be adding 2% to 4% of OpEx growth kind of quarter-to-quarter on the same-store, as we've been building out the footprint. And I think our expectation is that it certainly would not be radically different than that. I would probably go back and take it one level up, the way we will most effectively try to manage OpEx. If you go back to the Investor Day communications that the company had, we certainly expect to be able to be growing OpEx at a slower rate, obviously, than we're growing EBITDA over the medium term, right? We should be getting benefits of spreading operating expense investments over a larger base. And that should accrue to a slower or a lower slope of OpEx growth over that period of time.",Steve Bramlage,4393624
,,,,
14853,Question-and-Answer,"So we'll look to keep the whole thing in the medium term growing less than the EBITDA growth rate for sure. And on a same-store basis, kind of quarter-to-quarter, expect 2% to 4%, that?s historically what that number has been in the short-term, that's probably a pretty good rule of thumb to use.",Steve Bramlage,4393624
,,,,
14854,Question-and-Answer,"Is it fair for us to view it as a function of inside store gross profit, because just the issue, when I go back to EBITDA, the fuel margins move around so much in the industry that when you look at it in relation to EBITDA growth, the fuel margins can change, can kind of impact that analysis on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Is it fair to view it in relation to just inside gross profit? Or is that not a fair way to look at it?",Bobby Griffin ,4393624
,,,,
14855,Question-and-Answer,"Bobby, this is Darren. I mean, I think that's one way of looking at it, that's going to vary with a number of factors, right? The store operating hours are going to play a role. Frankly, even with inside sales, that can vary. If you think on one hand, our grocery and general merchandise categories are performing very well and accelerating. Those are probably less labor intensive than our prepared foods business. And so as prepared foods business accelerates, there may be some more labor applied there. Of course, that comes with more margin as well. ",Darren Rebelez,4393624
,,,,
14856,Question-and-Answer,,Darren Rebelez,4393624
,,,,
14857,Question-and-Answer,"So I think, it's pretty dynamic. But what we had shared with the street on our Investor Day was keeping that OpEx percentage growth below the EBITDA growth. And so that's really how we're looking at it at this point. ",Darren Rebelez,4393624

14858,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. ,Operator,4393624
,,,,
14859,Question-and-Answer,"I was hoping to hear a little more color on the trends you're seeing during November and so far during December, especially given the spike in COVID cases that we're seeing and some increased lockdowns. You did mention from the impact so far on your business. But be curious to hear any key differences during this wave maybe versus the first wave, maybe you could touch further on any initiatives you might be implementing to better handle the second wave? I am just thinking through if you've gotten any learnings from the first wave, and maybe why you'll be better equipped this time? Thanks. ",Bonnie Herzog ,4393624
,,,,
14860,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, sure. Certainly what we're seeing this go around isn't anywhere near as challenging as what we experienced the first go around, part of it is just we're accustomed operating in this environment now. The second thesis, I think municipalities and states have generally shunned the lockdown approach to things, whereas early on in the pandemic states were completely shutting things down. And so I think what they're trying to do is be a little more thoughtful around what types of restrictions they put in place where they're seeing outbreaks of COVID, and trying to address those areas, specifically, as opposed to locking everything down. So, that's more from a macro perspective. And we have a team that monitors this stuff every single day in terms of the various government regulations. I think that's one of the things that we're a lot sharper on now than perhaps in the early days of the pandemic. ",Darren Rebelez,4393624
,,,,
14861,Question-and-Answer,"All that being said, what we saw in November, that we talked about a little bit in early on December is that we are seeing some traffic start to slow a little bit. It's not anywhere near what we experienced in late fourth quarter and early first quarter last year. But it's certainly started to soften a bit. Our whole piece of business continues to perform very well, like it did before. We're seeing alcohol and tobacco improve as a result of that as well. But overall, the mix of products and merchandises in the stores is staying fairly consistent with what we've seen. It?s just on some reduced traffic. ",Darren Rebelez,4393624

14863,Question-and-Answer,"I wanted to circle up on fuel margins. Obviously, they've continued to be strong and maybe above historical average. Just wanted to ask about kind of the controllables, procurement, pricing, competitive environment from a promotional standpoint. Maybe just kind of speak to what you've seen, and what you can say from an outlook standpoint? Thank you. ",Paul Trussell,4393624
,,,,
14864,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. Thanks, Paul. I continue to believe that our fuels team is really outperforming what we're seeing in the rest of the industry. And when we look at the various benchmarks, whether it's from Opus or we see others? results, we tend to outperform on gallons, even though our gallons are negative and we've been outperforming our margin at the same time. And so, even though we're all sort of experiencing an elevated margin environment and a softer gallons environment, I would say that our team has done a better job of navigating that environment and performing well. So, if we look in the future, I've made a point not to try to crystal ball what fuel margins are going to be, because that tends to be a fool's errand. But what I will say is that, I feel very confident in whatever environment we're going to find ourselves in, that our team is prepared to handle that and we'll navigate it appropriately. And I think the evidence of the last 6 to 9 months will be the proof point of that. So, whatever we end up seeing, we'll be able to deal with it.",Darren Rebelez,4393624

14865,Question-and-Answer,,Darren Rebelez,4393624
,,,,
14866,Question-and-Answer,And then a follow-up is just regarding maybe any kind of learnings that would be interesting to kind of share with the group regarding the Rewards program. Obviously you spoke to exceeding 3 million members. The digital sales are triple-digits. Just any other kind of details and touch points there that you can offer from this rollout?,Paul Trussell,4393624
,,,,
14867,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, sure. And I'll caveat this by saying that, a lot of what we're learning I think is really inclusive of competitive advantage for us. So, I don't want to share a whole lot. But, what I can tell you is a couple of things. When we look at the mix of our Rewards guests and their purchasing behavior, one of the things we've found that's interesting is that, guests that come in the store also buy fuel and also make online purchases either through web or mobile app are only 16% of our total guests. So, when I look at that, I see there's a huge, huge opportunity for us to engage more of those guests that aren't taking full advantage of the suite of opportunities to buy all of our products. So, when I think about our digital platform, our Rewards platform and how we can engage our guests, I think there's tremendous upside there, and we're just now being able to have visibility to that type of opportunity. ",Darren Rebelez,4393624
,,,,
14868,Question-and-Answer,"The second thing, as we've been digging into our prepared foods and fountain performance, we were looking at Rewards data and looking particularly on the dispensed beverage side of things. And what we found is that, we've seen our fountain guests that would normally buy fountain, the preponderance of visits to the store, and then a smaller portion of the time would buy bottle and can or packaged beverage. We've seen that shift over the last several months with the pandemic to where those guests are more inclined to buy packaged beverages and less inclined to buy fountain. So when we look at the performance between the two categories, we are seeing a shift towards that packaged beverage. I think some of that is just related to guest comfort around a self-serve dispensed beverage versus something that's already packaged in a bottle and/or can. So, we are seeing some of that behavior shift. So it helps us -- gives us a little more comfort in terms of how the performance of that prepared food and fountain business is performing. So those are a couple of insights, Paul.",Darren Rebelez,4393624

14869,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania from BMO. Your line is now open.,Operator,4393624
,,,,
14870,Question-and-Answer,I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit in more detail about the dayparts and the performance. You talked a little bit about breakfast. But maybe just can you remind us what percent of the mix for prepared foods breakfast is and what you're seeing in the other dayparts and just what you can do to kind of manage that over the next couple of quarters? ,Kelly Bania,4393624
,,,,
14871,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, when we look at these numbers, they've all somewhat improved over the course of the pandemic, but we're down from a traffic standpoint in the morning daypart, we're down low double-digits. And then in the overnight daypart as well, we're down about a mid-teens. So the lunch and early evening daypart are a little less affected from a traffic standpoint. And this is all -- all stands to reason with more people working from home, with schools being virtual in a lot of cases that the morning commuting traffic has just been often and we see that particularly reflected in our breakfast products or coffee in our bakery and donuts in particular. ",Darren Rebelez,4393624
,,,,
14872,Question-and-Answer,"Okay, that's helpful. And just, I guess follow up on the prepared food category. Darren, just any update on how you are feeling about the test for twice a week deliveries? And maybe this isn't the ideal environment to test out. But just curious how you envision that category longer term, and you desire to kind of build out some more capabilities and fresher options inside the store? ",Kelly Bania,4393624
,,,,
14873,Question-and-Answer,,Kelly Bania,4393624
,,,,
14874,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, sure. With respect to the twice a week delivery, I think you'll recall, we had a 400 store test up and running when COVID hit. We put the brakes on that to allow things to settle. And we have plans to relaunch that in early part of the new calendar year. So we'll get back up and running with that. And then we'll see how that progresses. But with respect to the prepared foods overall, I think our team is really starting to hit its stride from a product development standpoint. If you recall, we brought on some new members to the team. And they're kind of hitting that five or six month mark with respect to their time at Casey's. And if you recall on Investor Day we talked about when we -- when you develop a fully vetted product pipeline, it takes about 18 months from ideation to commercialization. And so we're probably 11 -- 10 or 11 months into that process. And so the team does have some innovation in the pipeline. We're working through the progression on that with our guest insights and in validating things. But I'm very optimistic about the future and what the opportunities are that the team are creating. But it's just going to take a little bit more time to get through the process.",Darren Rebelez,4393624
,,,,
14875,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Fishbein from Jefferies. Your line is now open. ,Operator,4393624
,,,,
14876,Question-and-Answer,"Following up on the digital sales trends and new guest reach and the overall digital opportunity. Just wondering if you're seeing anything that suggests digital trends may be stickier, potentially more incremental than maybe it was thought in January. Perhaps in terms of the prepared food business that where we are from like a mobile ordering as a percent of revenue perspective or pickup versus delivery, potential incrementality from grocery add-ons. Where do you think it could shake out looking ahead versus where do you thought it could before the pandemic? ",Matt Fishbein,4393624
,,,,
14877,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, Matt. Well, certainly, we think and we've seen that the Rewards members are stickier guests so to speak. They do have higher frequencies and we think guests that are not on Rewards. And so we definitely see that upside there and we have the influence -- we have the ability to influence that behavior by connecting with them on a more individualized basis and personalized basis to influence that behavior. ",Darren Rebelez,4393624
,,,,
14878,Question-and-Answer,"With respect to the overall mix of digital, it?s still a relatively small part of our overall business, although it is a higher percentage of our prepared foods business, which you would expect because of preponderance of our e-commerce businesses and our pizza and our whole pie business. But like I mentioned earlier, a little bit more than 50% of our whole pizza orders are now coming in through some sort of digital means whether it's the app or the website. I would anticipate that, that continues to grow as more and more people become aware of it, we get more and more Rewards members, and we have more adoption. And so we like that. That gives us the ability to capture more data and be able to influence more behavior. ",Darren Rebelez,4393624
,,,,
14879,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. Thanks for that. And I guess just a follow-up. Obviously, back in January if you were to tell us that digital would be as much of a percent of sales as it is right now, we'd be all scratching our heads, because the pandemic has definitely pulled forward that significantly. But just compared to your expectations back in January, are you surprised how well the company's capabilities are holding up against that demand? Does it give you incremental confidence going forward that perhaps digital can be a larger piece of the business than previously thought? ",Matt Fishbein,4393624
,,,,
14880,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, I don't know that we're surprised it's been able to hold up. Frankly, I'd be disappointed if it didn't hold up in this kind of environment. We've been happy with it. We have exceeded our initial targets in terms of Rewards members enrolling in the program. So that's been good. I don't know that the pandemic has necessarily encouraged more people to enroll in Rewards. I think that's been driven more by our team and the marketing efforts around our Rewards program, and people are seeing value in it and adopted it. I think, with respect to actually making more purchases via e-commerce, I think, yes, we have accelerated some of that. But I think the guest experience in that digital space has been a positive one. So I think people are -- we're kind of nudged there as a result of the pandemic, but now the experience has been good, so that they're continuing to leverage that tool. So I think it's a combination of getting a little bit of help from the COVID environment, but then the Rewards program and the digital platform itself and the mobile app being very user-friendly and a good digital experience that kept people coming back.

,,,,
14883,Question-and-Answer,"So I had a question first on the fleet card program. So I think you said that 11% of your total volumes are coming from that. Can you give us a sense as to whether those customers are also coming into your stores? Are you able to drive incremental traffic to the stores, because of that fleet card program? Is there any way that you can quantify that, please?",Anthony Lebiedzinski ,4393624
,,,,
14884,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. Anthony, this is Steve. We haven't quantified it, per se. But we certainly do believe that, if we get incremental commercial business coming to our site, primarily to fuel with diesel products, that absolutely we're getting incremental visits inside the store from that, right? We don't have a 1-to-1 ratio of people as a normal course who come to fuel up, who go inside the store. But we certainly are trying to link, right, the commercial program with enrolling people in Casey?s Rewards et cetera and create benefits to the individual for them to come inside the store, as well as the relationship with their organization. So we will continue to try to drive behavior to go into the store. But as a general matter, yes, we get more people on the site. We're going to continue to drive more people through the inside of the store.",Steve Bramlage,4393624
,,,,
14885,Question-and-Answer,"And then as far as your same-store sales, is there any notable difference, as far as your performance for same-store sales between your rural locations and more of suburban locations?",Anthony Lebiedzinski,4393624
,,,,
14886,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. Listen, as a general matter, consistent with what we have seen really throughout the pandemic, our rural locations have performed modestly better from a same-store basis, whether that's inside the store performance or fuel performance, the rural spots. Again, there's a scarcity value with many of those locations have generally performed a little bit better than the urban ones. And that's been a consistent theme really for most of the calendar year.",Darren Rebelez,4393624
,,,,
14887,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Irene Nattel from RBC Capital Markets.,Operator,4393624
,,,,
14888,Question-and-Answer,"Why don't you come back to the whole question of fuel and certainly understand that nobody has a crystal ball. But what we've seen coming out of prior shocks to the system is kind of a permanent step up in fuel margins. And that's been a pretty consistent result. So as you think about the combination of your enhanced capabilities and what may yet choose to be -- may have become a higher industry fuel margin, how should we all be thinking about what that number looks like relative to let's say the last three years? Because of course, for investors that makes a very big difference in terms of what the perception around the sustainable earning level for Casey?s.",Irene Nattel,4393624
,,,,
14889,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, Irene, this is Darren. I guess, I would say, if you took out COVID, just count this year or so of COVID and threw that out, what you would have seen prior is kind of a slower, steady increase in retail margins for fuel over the last several years. And I think that's simply a function of underlying cost pressures continuing to affect the businesses and to a large part, because there's such a large base of smaller, independent, less sophisticated operators out there, they don't have a lot of levers to pull, and so they have to rely on fuel margins to do that. And that's naturally caused margins to inflate over time. I don't think that dynamic is going to change. The cost pressures are continuing. You see that happening right now with EMV as we move forward to EMV. And so I think that the preponderance of the industry will continue to see higher margins. ",Darren Rebelez,4393624
,,,,
14890,Question-and-Answer,"That being said, you have a counterbalance there with a lot of larger players consolidating the industry. And so over a longer period of time, there'll be fewer and larger players that at some point may seek to maximize market share at the expense of some margin. So, it's a little bit difficult to forecast. But I would say, in the intermediate term -- let?s say, the natural inclination of gradually increasing fuel margins is probably likely to persist. Where that shakes out versus today's levels is a little difficult to handicap. ",Darren Rebelez,4393624
,,,,
14891,Question-and-Answer,,Darren Rebelez,4393624
,,,,
14892,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you so much for that. And then I just want to come back to the whole prepared food question and the new product launches, and the insights that you're getting from sort of your digital engagement. And thinking even just in the current environment, very short-term, people are going to be stuck at home over Christmas and things like that, are you thinking about in the short and -- in the short-term until you get the full pipeline, about some product launches that can really just stimulate that demand to kind of bridge the gap? ",Irene Nattel,4393624
,,,,
14893,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, certainly, we're working on things that we can do in the short-term. While we're building the capability for the long-term, some of that tends to be a little more tactical in nature. I don't want to get into the specifics of that for competitive reasons. But yes, we're certainly not sitting on our heels waiting for the next six months to pass for the product pipeline to catch-up. So, we're balancing both some short-term opportunities while we're pursuing the long-term, talked about, in the pipeline. ",Darren Rebelez,4393624

14894,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian McNamara from Berenberg Capital. Your line is now open. ,Operator,4393624
,,,,
14895,Question-and-Answer,"Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I think Irene kind of asked the -- kind of the bulk of my question. But I was wondering if you can give us more color on how fuel margins continue to impact the M&A environment, particularly the smallest tuck-in variety, as you had mentioned it has given a welcomer sigh to some potential -- or the targets earlier this year. And particularly, I'm curious how the duration of these abnormally high margins compared to kind of like what you guys have expected internally as the years gone on? Thank you. ",Brian McNamara,4393624
,,,,
14896,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, with respect to the M&A environment, what we've seen in experienced is that the elevated fuel margins have given some of the smaller operators a little bit of an opportunity to hang on, I'll say. I think they're also beginning to realize that the pandemic is going to start to wind down and maybe these margins aren't as sustainable as they would have liked at these levels albeit they?ll probably end up at a higher place than where they started. I think also what's factoring in is the end of the calendar year, change in administration, potential changes in tax laws. So, there's a lot of things at play right now that we believe will start to encourage some people that may be sitting on the sidelines for this calendar year to maybe think differently in the next calendar year. So, we would expect some activity to pick up moving forward.",Darren Rebelez,4393624
,,,,
14897,Question-and-Answer,"And then just on the duration of how long kind of this leads, I mean I think the fuel margins continue to surprise. I'm just curious, kind of how this has landed relative to your expectations?",Brian McNamara,4393624
,,,,
14898,Question-and-Answer,"What we experienced early on was that as traffic dropped, the market kind of compensated for that with increased margins. And so, we would expect that -- I guess, we expected the margins to somewhat persist for as long as the pandemic impacts and the impacts on traffic and gallons sold were going to persist. Now -- so, I don't think that's been a surprise and I'm not sure that any of us had a real expectation about when the pandemic would start to subside. We certainly had forecasted internally that we expected a resurgence in the fall because that's what we're hearing from the scientific community and that's starting to play out. So, I'm not sure we had an expectation about when things would end, other than once the vaccine was widely distributed, that would take place. So, I think now the best data that we have on that is that, probably sometime mid calendar '21 is when things will start to maybe look a little bit more normal.",Darren Rebelez,4393624

,,,,
14901,Question-and-Answer,"Good morning, everyone. Sort of a technical question and looking at the credit card fees, they're about flat year-over-year in the second quarter but down significantly in the half and that implies, of course, the first quarter as well. What's going on there and what does it tell us about demand trends?",Chuck Cerankosky ,4393624
,,,,
14902,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. I don't think there's too much to read into it per se. I mean, the quarter-to-quarter, sequential trend in credit card fees is to some extent going to be driven by the price of fuel, right, and what we're seeing in terms of the retail price of fuel and from a year-over-year standpoint. We're always in the midst of various renegotiations with financial institutions around some of the fees. And so, I don't think there's anything we would point to that there's been a substance of change in the way we're incurring or the way we would expect to incur credit card fees over the medium-term as the price of fuel certainly drives it quite a bit in any particular quarter.",Steve Bramlage,4393624

But it's big enough. So we're going to remain diligent in terms of trying to manage it to the best of our ability. But no, we would certainly not have any near-term expectation of change directly because of the conversations we're having now, because it is quite a long lead time for us to get that stuff through the pipe.",Steve Bramlage,4393624

,,,,
14906,Question-and-Answer,"I'll just do one. I know we're kind of short on time. So appreciate the color earlier on the post-Bucky's numbers. Is there any view you can give us on what run rate capital spend levels might look going forward following the transaction, just thinking about the maintenance levels and 94 new stores? And I know, I think you discussed on the prior call, $50 million over three years to achieve synergy. So just trying to see where you think the kind of run rate level would shake out?",John Royall ,4393624
,,,,
14907,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, I'll start with that, John. So I think the net investment back into the Bucky's Stores to give our kitchens in over the next couple years have a $50 million number, that's still -- that's a reasonable estimate based on the information we have. Our point of view does not change as it relates to that at all. I think from a run rate perspective, they run in call it somewhere -- if I look at it from a D&A perspective, it's probably the easiest way for me to describe it. I would expect once we get through intangible valuation associated with that transaction, we probably will incur somewhere in the neighborhood of about $20 million of incremental D&A from that deal, right? We will be depreciating their assets. There'll be a couple million dollars of additional intangible amortization and the money that we put in, it?s probably $5 million to $6 million. And so I think $20 million going forward for the first couple of years all in would be reflective of kind of cost of the capital investments that we will be receiving from that transaction.",Steve Bramlage,4393624

,,,,
14943,Presentation,"While over 60% of our directly operated facilities in China have gradually resumed operations since late May, we had another over 30%, which we opened in September.

,,,,
14944,Presentation,Franchise service revenues also decreased due to the slowdown of play-and-learn center network expansion and lower revenues generated from existing franchisees as their recovery from operation suspension was gradual in the third quarter after reopenings in late May this year.,Hao Gu,4393617
,,,,
14945,Presentation,"Product revenues for the third quarter of 2020 were US$2.8 million, compared with US$4.2 million for the same quarter last year.

,,,,
14950,Presentation,,Hao Gu,4393617
,,,,
14951,Presentation,"The decrease in G&A expenses, excluding share-based compensations, was also primarily due to the strict cost control measures that we carried out in the company headquarters, in particular in staff compensation, professional fees, travel and other operational expenses.

,,,,
14956,Presentation,"Now in terms of business outlook, as most of our facilities have been reopened as of the date of this press release, we currently expect our business to continue to recover from the pandemic during the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter of 2020, the company's management currently expects net revenues to be in the range of US$42 million to US$43 million.",Hao Gu,4393617
,,,,
14957,Presentation,"The above outlook is based on the current market conditions and reflects the company's management's current and preliminary estimates of - market and operating conditions as well as customer demand, all of which are still subject to change.",Hao Gu,4393617
,,,,
14958,Presentation,"And that concludes our prepared presentation. We will now open the call to questions. Anida, please go ahead. Thank you.",Hao Gu,4393617
,,,,
14959,Question-and-Answer,[Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Elsie Sheng with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.,Operator,4393617
,,,,
14960,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you, management. My first question is about new student recruitment of [your-self] operated kindergartners. You mentioned that over 90% of your original students has returned to kindergartens. I'm wondering, do you have any detail to share about the efficiency of your new student recruitment is there still any impact from the COVID? And what is the result of - as you mentioned, the online-offline-merged recruits during the recruitment metrics.",Elsie Sheng,4393617
,,,,
14961,Question-and-Answer,And my second question is about - do you have any outlook for the coming year in terms of the growth and also margin and your strategy? Thank you.,Elsie Sheng,4393617
,,,,
14962,Question-and-Answer,"So enrollment or rather reenrollment is on a rolling basis, as our directly operated kindergartens reopened after the prior period of temporary facility closure. Before the reopening of kindergartens in Beijing in early September, individual facilities and kindergarten management team together made a lot of efforts in preparing for reopening and kept an open communication with parents.",Yanlai Shi,4393617
,,,,
14963,Question-and-Answer,"So some of the efforts include for example, during the temporary closure period, an ongoing focus was always on maintaining a good level off enrollment and after facilities have resumed operation, new students continue to be admitted on a rolling basis, and site renovation of some directly operated kindergartens have enabled a larger overall capacity for more classes.",Yanlai Shi,4393617
,,,,
14964,Question-and-Answer,,Yanlai Shi,4393617
,,,,
14965,Question-and-Answer,"So for the directly operated facilities in Beijing for example, we help online parent tutor catch up sessions and virtual one-on-one parent teaching. Started from June 1, we made a countdown in five steps to the reopening and shared with children and parents video recordings and snippets of quality pre-pandemic kindergarten life to bring back good memories and get them ready for their return to the facilities.",Yanlai Shi,4393617
,,,,
14966,Question-and-Answer,"For the kindergartens located outside of Beijing, they started a Phase 3 opening gradually from the end of the second quarter or around May or June-ish. And by September, they were quite ready to welcome the full September batch of students returned to school.",Yanlai Shi,4393617
,,,,
14967,Question-and-Answer,"Before the September semester, some online courses charging a small fee were made available in some areas, along with courses related to enrollment preparation, which received good feedback and contributed to a good enrollment in September.",Yanlai Shi,4393617
,,,,
14968,Question-and-Answer,"So under normal circumstances, there are mainly two peaks of admission or enrollment one in March and another in September each year. This year due to the challenges brought by the pandemic, we in response temporarily closed our facilities. And as a result, the March batch of students were not enrolled. Most of those students chose to enroll in September when facilities reopened, which contributed to the number of students enrolled this September.",Yanlai Shi,4393617
,,,,
14969,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, and also on top of that Elsie I can also add a few student enrollment data sets. The total number of students enrolled as of end of September, at our directly operated facilities were 27,912 students. And this is actually almost 11% increase from the end of September enrolled students last year. And also if we also exclude the facilities that opened that are newly opened over the past four quarters and we do apple-to-apple comparison.",Hao Gu,4393617
,,,,
14970,Question-and-Answer,"The total number of students at the end of September this year was 24,700. And this also, you know, we had a meaningful 12% increase from the sorry apologies. So the end of September students this year was 27,711 students. And this basically represents a 12% increase from the 24,700 students by the end of September last year. So as Grace mentioned, in March this year, our facilities were essentially - suspended or closed because of the pandemic.",Hao Gu,4393617
,,,,
14971,Question-and-Answer,"So for that new semester, the new students that we would have enrolled, we were able to still enroll them in the new September semester this year. So this actually also contributed to the total number of students that I just mentioned. And also at the end of November, this year, the total number of students who had registered with a fee, but not yet started attendance at our directly operated facilities was 1,625 students.",Hao Gu,4393617
,,,,
14972,Question-and-Answer,And this number actually reflects the result of our early enrollment efforts and contributes to the increased enrollment in the future.,Hao Gu,4393617
,,,,
14973,Question-and-Answer,"So for the second question in 2021, we?ll continue to focus on the company's core business operations and the following aspects of our kindergarten and plan our center business. So for the directly operated kindergartens, we stay committed to providing high quality education and service to students and families. And at the same time maintain a good enrollment at our inclusive kindergartens.",Yanlai Shi,4393617
,,,,
14974,Question-and-Answer,"Secondly, we'll continue to work on the revamping of some premium offering in our national kindergartens. At the moment, there are still some core profit premium and international kindergartens in operations that are still in a run-up period and can enroll more students. And in addition, we look forward to introducing the kindergarten courses with online features enabled and developed by our in-house R&D teams to other kindergarten operators.",Yanlai Shi,4393617
,,,,
14975,Question-and-Answer,"In terms of our play-and-learn center business, we?ll continue to provide improved supervisory and training services to the franchisees and strengthen our bond with them by providing support in marketing, sales, administration and home education. On the other hand, we believe an upgraded system and product offerings will help us reach out to more planners and our operators in the early education market.",Yanlai Shi,4393617
,,,,
14976,Question-and-Answer,,Yanlai Shi,4393617
,,,,
14977,Question-and-Answer,"With a solid system and good support, there will be plenty of opportunities for us to extend and serve third-party operators. The company remains its operational focus on its core business and kindergartens and play-and-learn centers and we?ll continue its efforts in an integrated online-merge-offline business model. We'll also prudently control our costs and spending to support current operations and deliver better results.",Yanlai Shi,4393617
,,,,
14978,Question-and-Answer,"And Elsie on your questions about the margins outlook for our business next year, I think as Chris mentioned, we will continue to focus on core business of kindergartens and the play-and-learn centers. For kindergartens, with conversion of some of our facilities to inclusive facilities, we do see a reduction in our tuition fee.",Hao Gu,4393617
,,,,
14979,Question-and-Answer,"But I think to a large extent, this will be balanced out or mitigated by a significant increase in the class size and number of students enrolled after the facility conversion. And I think for next year, another focus for our directly operated kindergarten is also for us to, you know continue to ramp up the utilization rate of students enrolled at some of our full profit and high end international branded facilities.",Hao Gu,4393617
,,,,
14980,Question-and-Answer,"And I think with this ramp up, we hope to maintain or increase slightly increase the profit margins for our directly operated kindergarten business. And I think for play-and-learn centers in terms of franchise model and the sales of merchandise, the margins are quite stable, and we anticipate the margins will remain largely unchanged.",Hao Gu,4393617
,,,,
14981,Question-and-Answer,"So the main challenge or task for us next year is really to increase the sales by continue to sign up new contracts and expanding our franchise network. And I think if you look at the overall margins or margin targets for us next year, we also hope that by adopting stringent cost control measures at our headquarters level, as well as you know B2B we try to be more prudent in making strategic investments.",Hao Gu,4393617
,,,,
14982,Question-and-Answer,"Because some of the early stage investment that we made earlier also incurred losses for us. So, being more prudent on making additional strategic investments will also hopefully help us improve the overall margin for our growth next year.",Hao Gu,4393617
,,,,
14983,Question-and-Answer,The next question comes from [Sam Han with Sage Capital]. Please go ahead.,Operator,4393617
,,,,
14984,Question-and-Answer,Could you please introduce any impacts on foreign teacher supply due to the pandemic? Thank you.,Unidentified Analyst,4393617
,,,,
14985,Question-and-Answer,"So, due to the restrictions in and the frequent adjustments to the, immigration and border control policies as a result of COVID-19 global pandemic. The company has experienced some impact on maintaining foreign teachers in certain kindergartens in China and during the period of temporary facility closure previously some facilities arranged online sessions to conduct virtual learning which helped to maintain enrollment.",Yanlai Shi,4393617
,,,,
14986,Question-and-Answer,"So we're adjusting our recruitment practices accordingly by leveraging internal flexibility for example, for facilities that are recently converted to inclusive kindergartens, we're able to transfer out foreign teachers there to support high end and for profit facilities. In addition, online teaching interactions and also shortened foreign teachers sessions during the day are some of the other measures addressing the issue.",Yanlai Shi,4393617
,,,,
14987,Question-and-Answer,"Our talent management team continues to work on the recruitment through various channels. Although the labor costs of foreign teachers may rise as a result under these current circumstances, it is of great help to the enrollment as some of the premium and international kindergartens.",Yanlai Shi,4393617
,,,,
14988,Question-and-Answer,The next question comes from [indiscernible]. Please go ahead.,Operator,4393617
,,,,
14989,Question-and-Answer,"It's impressive to see the business back on track. But I also noticed in September, there was a drop of the proposed preschool education law posted online to solicit public opinion. Can management comments on the likely impact on your business? Thank you.",Unidentified Analyst,4393617
,,,,
14990,Question-and-Answer,,Unidentified Analyst,4393617
,,,,
14991,Question-and-Answer,"With the help of internal and external legal teams, we were briefed on the possible impact of the proposed laws and regulations in the draft. Carefully studied it?s generally in line with what the company has previously expected.",Yanlai Shi,4393617
,,,,
14992,Question-and-Answer,"Currently, the company's service offerings and business operations are diversified in kindergartens, play-and-learn centers, franchise business, other service offerings and our operations in Singapore. The proposed preschool education law may only affect our operation in directly operated kindergarten in China.",Yanlai Shi,4393617
,,,,
14993,Question-and-Answer,"For the directly operated kindergarten business, the company will make appropriate adjustments in - accordance with regulations in the future to ensure the legal compliance of operations. At the moment, there is no clear timetable for the official promulgation of the preschool education law as being marked. We?ll promptly communicate with the investor community once the company has further information. Thank you.",Yanlai Shi,4393617

Noting this milestone a success as we strive for continuous improvement in this most important category, I'd like to thank all our team members for their unwavering determination and focus.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15003,Presentation,"Moving out to the first-half highlights on Slide 3. Our performance in the second quarter very much picks up where we left off in September at the time of our Q1 results, with sequential momentum that continued to build through the period. Our theme of extreme focus on all our stakeholders remains. And I think you'll agree that the results today further support the statements that we have come through for our people, our customers, our investors and our communities.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15004,Presentation,"This performance once again demonstrates the diversity of our business, which has performed well in good times, but importantly through more challenging times in a cycle as we're experiencing this year. The confidence we have in our model supported longer-term decision making, early in the crisis that we believe contributed to a performance that has clearly yielded market share gains.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15005,Presentation,"Specifically, this performance has shown the resiliency in our general tool segment and ongoing growth within our specialty business, and markets that we believe have clear and present paths for ongoing structural change opportunities.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15006,Presentation,"Our revenue performance and continued cash and operating cost discipline in the period delivered a half year record free cash flow of 822 million, contributing to reducing our debt and lowering leverage to 1.7 times net debt to EBITDA. Our well-worn path of organic expansion continued with 12 Greenfield's added in the period, a plan that we will continue to execute. I'm pleased to announce our decision to maintain the interim dividend at 7.15p.",Brendan Horgan,4393601

15008,Presentation,"With these results and momentum in the business, and further assuming our markets do not experienced increased shutdowns similar to those we experienced earlier in the year, we now expect full year results ahead of our previous expectations.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15009,Presentation,"Turning to Slide 4, I'll add some specifics to our full year outlook. Beginning with rental revenue and their respective currency. We improved the U.S. guidance to be in the minus 4% to minus 7% range, Canada and the UK increased to 15% to 20% growth for the full year. These movements amount to improving the group range to minus 3% to minus 7%. The improved revenue guidance throughout the operating divisions reflects the performance of the business to-date, and our current outlook. Notably, the increase in our UK and Canadian guidance reflects higher than expected Q2 activity levels, specifically, testing centers activities in the UK, and lighting grip and studio revenues in Canada. We'll cover these in more detail in the slides to come.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15010,Presentation,"From a CapEx standpoint, we increased our guidance to 650 million to 700 million, reflecting the ongoing investment in the growth of our specialty business, response efforts and replacement plans, all placing us in a good position to address opportunities in the back half as well as into next year. Notwithstanding this increasing CapEx or guidance for free cash flow is now greater than 1.2 billion, 20% higher than our previous guidance.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15011,Presentation,"On that note, I'll now hand it over to Michael to cover the financials in more detail. Michael?",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15012,Presentation,"Thanks, Brendan, and good morning. The group's results for the first-half as shown on Slide 6, and it's been a strong performance in what continues to be an uncertain environment. Group rental revenue declined 4% on a constant currency basis, this revenue decline had a negative impact on margins, reflecting in part our decision not to make any team members redundant as a result of COVID-19, not to reduce pay levels nor take advantage of any government support programs, such as the coronavirus job retention scheme.",Michael Pratt,4393601
,,,,
15013,Presentation,"Throughout this time, we continue to invest in the business including our technology platform, and our rental fleet to ensure it was serviced, well maintained and rent ready in advance of recovery and activity.",Michael Pratt,4393601
,,,,
15014,Presentation,"Furthermore, in addition to not reducing pay levels, we continue to pay bonuses and made additional discretionary payments to our skilled trade workforce, as a mark of thanks for their hard work and dedication in working safely in a far from easy COVID-19 environment. While this was a drag on margins, the EBITDA margin was still healthy 47%. When operating profit margin of 25%, underlying pre-tax profit for the six months was 538 million and earnings per share were 89p.",Michael Pratt,4393601
,,,,
15015,Presentation,Turning now to the businesses. Slide 7 shows a performance in the U.S. Rental and related revenue for the six months was 6% lower than last year at $2.5 billion. In the second quarter rental revenue was only 3% lower than the prior year aided by revenue from Hurricane response efforts. This impact was much reduced as we entered the third quarter.,Michael Pratt,4393601
,,,,
15016,Presentation,"As we discussed in September, we took a number of actions to manage the cost base including a higher increase and reducing discretionary staff costs, use of third-party freight haulers and other operating expenses, consistent with reduced activity levels. However, our most valuable asset is our people. And as I mentioned earlier, we have been proactive in retaining them and looking after them.",Michael Pratt,4393601
,,,,
15017,Presentation,"These factors enable us to maintain customer service levels and prepare for markets reopening. As a result, drop through of rental revenue to EBITDA for the period was 73%. As I said at Q1, while this approach had a small negative impact on margins, I think you'll agree it has been more than vindicated by our significant market outperformance as we take share.",Michael Pratt,4393601

15019,Presentation,"Margins were also affected adversely by used equipment sales. While second hand values remain healthy overall, our proceeds were affected by both the type of assets we sold and the sales channels selected for disposal.",Michael Pratt,4393601
,,,,
15020,Presentation,"We dispose of a number of old oil and gas assets, which typically have a hard life and hence a lower resale value. And sales were predominately through the auction channel which results in lower realizations. This accounted for a 1% drag on margins. Despite these factors, the EBITDA margin was still healthy at 50%. Operating profit was $782 million at a 28% margin and ROI was 18%.",Michael Pratt,4393601
,,,,
15021,Presentation,"Turning now to Canada on Slide 8. Rental and related revenue was 13% higher than a year ago on a reported basis at $188 million. This includes the impact of William F. White acquired a year ago. On a more comparable basis, excluding William F. White rental revenue was 8% lower than a year ago. The White's business was the Group?s business affected most severely by the pandemic. It performed strongly since acquisition, but in March, it ground to a halt of all film and TV production stopped. As a result it contributed virtually no revenue in Q1. But as we've discussed before, we retained all the team members and the infrastructure of the business to ensure that we were on the front foot when production resumed.",Michael Pratt,4393601
,,,,
15022,Presentation,"Again, this approach has been vindicated as it enabled the business to bounce back strongly since production resumed in August and September. With October revenue almost equaling it's best month ever.",Michael Pratt,4393601
,,,,
15023,Presentation,"These factors contribute to a loss for the White's business of $2 million for the six months, which impacted Canadian margins adversely. The legacy Canadian businesses EBITDA margin excluding White's was improved at 45%, and it generated an operating profit of $35 million at a 20% margin. This is an impressive performance in this environment and demonstrate strong cost discipline in what is still an immature business, which does not yet have the benefit of well-developed clusters, or the depth and breadth of our full range of specialty businesses.",Michael Pratt,4393601
,,,,
15024,Presentation,"Turning now to Slide 9, UK rental and related revenue was similar to a year ago at 260 million. This was a strong performance as the breadth of our product offering and commitment of our team members enabled us to support all our existing and new customers and provide essential support to the national response to COVID-19. Our support for the Department of Health account for almost 20% of our half year revenue.",Michael Pratt,4393601
,,,,
15025,Presentation,"Turning now to the cost base, this reflects our continued investments in the operational infrastructure of the business as part of Project Unify, and the cost of service the Department of Health test sites.",Michael Pratt,4393601
,,,,
15026,Presentation,"Our investment in the operational infrastructure included a charge reportedly 10 million to reshape the operating footprint of the business. This was taken as an impairment charge and is included within depreciation for the period. These factors resulted in EBITDA margin of 32% and an operating profit margin of 7%. As a result, UK operating profit was 20 million for the half year.",Michael Pratt,4393601
,,,,
15027,Presentation,"Slide 10 sets out the Group's cash flows for the six months and the last 12 months. This slide again tells a powerful story and demonstrates the strength of our business model. We have maintained a strong focus on working capital management, particularly the collection of receivables, which has resulted in cash flow from operations of 1.2 billion in six months. This combined with the decisive action we took to reduced capital expenditure in the current environment, resulted in record free cash flow for six months of 822 million, more than we generated in the whole of last year, our best ever for cash generation.",Michael Pratt,4393601
,,,,
15028,Presentation,"As a result, we've generated 1.4 billion of free cash flow in the last 12 months and that is after CapEx of over 900 million. It is this cash flow dynamic within the business that gives us confidence to expect free cash flow generation this year in excess of 1.2 billion, compared with last year's 792 million.",Michael Pratt,4393601
,,,,
15029,Presentation,,Michael Pratt,4393601
,,,,
15030,Presentation,"Brendan has touched on this earlier, but it's important to recognize that while we reduced our capital expenditure this year, this has not been at the expense of the future. We've executed in last week disposal plan as intended, but with lower demand overall, we have replaced only highly utilized assets where there is the demand, and spent the balance on growth in other assets where demand is high, particularly in our specialty businesses. This is where we get the phrase, growth disguised as replacement when talking about capital expenditure.",Michael Pratt,4393601
,,,,
15031,Presentation,Slide 11 updates on debt and leverage position at the end of October. We used the cash generated in the period to reduce debt and leverage which at 1.7 times excluding the impact of IFRS 16 is in the lower half of that target range.,Michael Pratt,4393601
,,,,
15032,Presentation,"To put this into context, as you can see from the chart on the top right, this is as low as leverage has been in October, typically the seasonal high point of the year, in all my years at Ashtead. This point is worth dwelling on. Never has the flexibility of our model been more clearly demonstrated than in this year of adversity.",Michael Pratt,4393601
,,,,
15033,Presentation,"Our ability to flex capital expenditure down at short notice and generate significant free cash flow against adverse market backdrop has enabled us to reduce leverage from 1.9 times in April to 1.7 times in October, despite lower EBITDA. That is the strength of this model.",Michael Pratt,4393601
,,,,
15034,Presentation,"As we've said on many occasions, this strong balance sheet and flexibility gives us a competitive advantage and positions us well for the future. It is important to recognize that this has been achieved while we've continued to invest in the business through retaining our people, investing in our technology capability, Greenfield openings, and additional capital expenditure to both support the pandemic response and take advantage of growth opportunities.",Michael Pratt,4393601
,,,,
15035,Presentation,"It is this position of strength that has enabled us to outperform the market and take market share. Our debt facilities are committed for an average of five years as a weighted average cost of 4%. Both our leverage and well invested fleet continue to provide a high degree of flexibility and security and enable the business to be on the front foot, despite these more uncertain times.",Michael Pratt,4393601
,,,,
15036,Presentation,"And with that, I'll hand back to Brendan.",Michael Pratt,4393601
,,,,
15037,Presentation,"Thank you, Michael. We?ll now move on to some operational and end market detail beginning with Slide 13.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15038,Presentation,"As I indicated in the highlights and as illustrated in the top left, the sequential momentum in the U.S. gained traction throughout the second quarter. Our Q2 rental revenue on a billings per day basis was 3% lower than last year, with general tool lagging by 7% and our specialty business delivering an incredibly strong growth performance of 18%. In more recent trading, we continued to perform well in November with U.S. rental revenue down 4%, general tool minus 6%, and specialty delivering a still strong 9% growth on last year.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15039,Presentation,"It's clear that performance in general tool and specialty have outperformed the market, highlighting both the diverse end markets our business now addresses and the uniquely powerful cross selling capability our model delivers. Doing so while exercising discipline and rate and consistent with the experience in quarter four of last year, and quarter one, rates again remained sequentially flat, experiencing zero downward movement through this period. A result I think we can now call a trend throughout our industry. I will add some color to the driving factors behind this shortly.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15040,Presentation,"Through the quarter, we have of course benefited from increased hurricane activity levels. During our September results, you may recall our updating the market on the late August activity derived from Hurricane Laura, which made landfall in Louisiana, August 28. Well, Laura was not the last hurricane. In fact, there were 30 named storms in the season, 12 of which hit the U.S. coastline, five came ashore in Louisiana alone.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15041,Presentation,,Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15042,Presentation,"So rather than get into the particulars by storm, perhaps we use the format of the chart on the top left of the slide, as best we can to indicate rental revenues absent this Hurricane effect. In Quarter 2, absent hurricanes, U.S. rental revenue would have been down 6%, general tool down 8% and specialty up a still healthy 9%. This is applying a conservative assumption that no revenues would have been generated outside of the storm response with the assets that were deployed.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15043,Presentation,"Moving on and as promised in September, I'll now add more detail by specialty business unit over the next few slides beginning with number 14. The year-on-year rental revenue movement gives a more granular look into individual specialty divisions and portrays well the sequential improvement most experienced from Q1 to Q2, while further demonstrating the growth during these unprecedented times. Our understanding of these specialty divisions and markets they serve coupled with our long track record of growth and now scale gives us the ability to confidently state that we are in the early stages of structural change, leaving us a long runway for growth in the future.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15044,Presentation,"So why has our specialty business outperformed the way it has, and our general tool business for that matter? One reason, as I've stated before, is our uniquely powerful cross selling capabilities that our model delivers. And another reason is the large, broad and diverse end markets we serve and vigorously pursue. I think the latter reason requires a better understanding of these markets. And to do so let's go to Slide 15.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15045,Presentation,"The slide shows at a summary level three broad non-construction markets. Moving left to right. Maintenance, repair and operations, including facilities and geographic markets themselves, encompassing in park square footage under roof and municipal operations. Entertainment, although not a lot going on these days. It is a space that is sure to return as populations are eager, however, with a heightened level of awareness to cleanliness and spacing organization. And emergency response, an area where we have repeatedly demonstrated as being broad in and of itself, ranging from large geographic events to local more concentrated events happening daily throughout our geographic markets. These markets amassed nearly 500 billion annual spend, maintaining buildings that already stand, infrastructure already in place, existing sporting and entertainment venues with the sole purpose to hold events, all of which from time to time are affected by unpredictable influences that require emergency response.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15046,Presentation,"I'll remind you, these are the markets that make up roughly 55% of our total North American revenues. These large and incredibly diverse market segments are entirely non-construction and have ample growth opportunities for our unique complement of products and services. As the scale and coverage of our specialty business continues to grow, we increasingly make rental a reliable alternative to ownership. And rental will over time increasingly augment ownership, growing our specialty business and positively influencing our general tool business. We're looking forward to covering a more detail of these markets, the size we believe they will become, and therefore our opportunities as part of our Capital Markets Day in April.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15047,Presentation,"In the meantime, let's add some color to the diversity in these markets, and range of unique applications and solutions our products serve. I'll give some specific examples beginning with Slide 16.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15048,Presentation,"Setting up this slide and the slides to follow, you'll notice a rather granular selection of markets listed on the right, and four specific examples in the center and left. Each of which are actual projects or transactions for specific but unnamed customers serviced in this current fiscal year. This slide gives a selection of our power and HVAC business in terms of its markets and applications. In the spirit of time, I'll highlight just two on this and the following slide.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15049,Presentation,,Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15050,Presentation,"The bottom right example shows an engineered solution for a national e-commerce retailer, providing seasonal air conditioning and requisite power at 225 of their distribution and fulfillment centers. The example on the top right demonstrates our work with a couple cellular network providers, where inside of six months, we delivered 1,770 portable generators to serve in various standby and prime power applications.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15051,Presentation,"Moving to Slide 17, we illustrate the wide range of markets and applications within our scaffold business and reference the industrial project pictured on the bottom right, which was our largest ever scaffold project last in for years. We completed this project in quarter 1, which we've referenced when speaking to our year-over-year comps in the scaffold business. We've just begun work on a project very similar to this one, only larger, which we expect to grow and continue for a number of years to come.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15052,Presentation,"The example on the top left summarizes our response following a tornado early this summer, where our skilled team quickly designed, engineered and erected a temporary closure at a vital automotive parts factory that was damaged during the storm. This is not the kind of natural disaster that gets national or international coverage, however, nonetheless an emergency in this small southeast town. In all these cases and indeed market segments, our general tool business also benefits as the products offered also have wide ranging applications. These opportunities often come on the heels of specialty customer wins. In the appendix, you'll find similar slides highlighted in our climate control and flooring business for review at your leisure.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15053,Presentation,"Turning now to Slide 18, we will cover the latest forecast activity levels within the U.S. construction market as well as rental industry forecasts both through 2023. Dodge starts and put in place data demonstrates the steep decline and starts from March amounting to roughly a full year impact of 15%, which leads to a put in place forecast decline of 6% in the current year. More important at this stage, of course, are the future years. The latest forecasts for put in place construction in 2021 is now minus 3%, which compares to the June forecast of 0%. This is followed by a consistent recovery in 2022 and 2023, similarly the rental market is forecasted to reduce by 13% compared to the June forecast of minus 12% in 2020, followed by flat year in 2021 and recovering nicely through 2023.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15054,Presentation,"In summary, 2020 is forecasted to be better than initial construction, and industry estimates deferring some of the decline into next year with little difference thereafter. I think it's important to note that our individual results have consistently outperformed construction and industry forecasts, and the forecast in the current calendar year improved from the early pandemic-related outlook.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15055,Presentation,"Further, you will notice our look back illustration of Dodge's construction forecast from 2016. We like the granular nature Dodge employees when building their models, which proved accurate in forecasting the previous cycles, as you will see from their 2016 forecast figures. As always, I point out these forecasts are not our own, they're a collection of the best available market data we have. Our team stays in constant discussion with firms like Dodge to understand their views and gain granular insight both geographically and in specific construction component trends, all of which we verify and balance with our broad on the ground team who is in the end closest to our customers.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15056,Presentation,"With forecast like this, coupled with the underlying uncertainty in these times, and our results thus far, validate further our conviction that customers are increasingly choosing the flexibility in OpEx deployment available through rental versus the long-term commitment and ongoing costs related to ownership.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15057,Presentation,,Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15058,Presentation,"Moving on to Slide 19, I thought it was worthwhile to share some color on the industry, specifically referencing rental fleet levels. As the top left graph indicates, in a remarkably short period of time from the early days of the COVID impact through the end of November, the industry has reduced its fleet from what was 9% larger than a year ago in March to what is today 5% less than last November. 5% of fleet for the rental companies compiled within this Rouse data amount to nearly 3 billion of fleet no longer in the market, roughly amounting to a fleet size of the third or fourth largest player in the space. This is no small movement in fleet.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15059,Presentation,"Further, as indicated in the graph on the bottom of the slide, the industry entered March lagging utilization levels enjoyed the previous years by 4%. And although it's been a tumultuous ride, today the industry is in better form from a supply and demand perspective than it was pre-COVID, having reduced the year-on-year delta to 3%.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15060,Presentation,"This clearly demonstrates the discipline present among the industry leaders today, managing supply levels through reduced new fleet landings and accelerated asset disposals. Done in a manner that has maintained healthy second hand equipment values and contributing to the ongoing rental rate resilience I referenced earlier.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15061,Presentation,"I think we can all agree, the discipline and results thus far are in stark contrast to what we experienced individually, and as an industry during the '08, '09 recession.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15062,Presentation,"Moving on now to our business in Canada on Slide 22. Similar to the trends we are experiencing in the U.S., our Canadian business is performing well with volumes tracking closely to those of last year. From a construction and rental market forecast standpoint, the latest remain unchanged from our previous update both forecasting and return to growth in 2021, continuing through 2023. To best illustrate the progression of what we call the power of Sunbelt into Canada through building clustered markets with our full offering.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15063,Presentation,"Let's turn to Slide 21. From our humble beginnings in Western Canada, we have grown to 12 locations in the Vancouver market. Key of course to delivering on our mantra of availability, reliability and ease is convenience, proximity and diversity in our offering. Beginning with a complement of general tool businesses and adding specialty into the mix to introduce cross-selling. Our runway for growth in Vancouver and in the rest of Canada remains long.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15064,Presentation,"Before we leave Canada let's turn to Slide 22, and briefly cover our lighting, grip and studio business, William F. White. Activity levels improved sooner than we expected during quarter 2. By September, we were back to pre-COVID revenue levels, in October achieved near record revenues for the business and a trend which improved having achieved a record high in November.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15065,Presentation,"Although, we were pleasantly surprised by the timing of this recovery, all science had pointed to heightened content demand, and the William F. White team was incredibly engaged with our customers through the shutdown period working to create a safe return to production. The demand came through as did our relative market share gains as our workforce was on the ready. We anticipate this demand will continue and will increasingly recognize cross selling opportunities in this space with a broader Sunbelt product offering.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15066,Presentation,"Turning now to Sunbelt UK on Slide 23. Let's first address the underlying business. Our revenues excluding Department of Health activities achieved prior levels late in the quarter, despite live events business remaining near zero. These results were amplified by our DOH activities to support the COVID testing center rollout across the UK.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15067,Presentation,"This clear outperformance to the market is directly correlated to our project unified deliverables, leading to gains in the ongoing construction and maintenance related rental space. Our decisions in the early days of COVID put our team in a position to capture share and engage with our customers on current and perspective work. A position we believe will give us the opportunity to further benefit from in the future as we continue to focus on delivering for our customers.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15068,Presentation,,Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15069,Presentation,"Although we have increased our CapEx plans for the year principally to support the ongoing DOH work, the business will remain in a strong free cash flow position for the year. Let's take a look at the COVID response efforts on Slide 24.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15070,Presentation,"The Sunbelt team has materially participated in standing up nearly 300 testing centers comprised of over 230,000 individual assets throughout the UK. Consistent with our last update, I'll remind you this work was not a deliver and drop off order, rather a complete solution to include design, project management, logistics, delivery, installation and ongoing service. We have invested in new fleet, people and training as part of this effort. And as I've said before, this work will not go unrecognized, internally or externally.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15071,Presentation,Delivering on a project of such significant scale and complexity will amount to a step change in stature of this business in the eyes of customers and the broader service sector. I know our team members are very proud to have participated in coming to the aid of the communities they live and work during a time of real need.,Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15072,Presentation,"We remain in the early stages of forging our path to sustainable, long-term results and returns. At this stage, we are encouraged with our results and forecast a strong year of revenue and profit growth. There remains work to be done and our leadership team is engaged, encouraged, and as a result of these early efforts positioned well to execute.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15073,Presentation,"Turning now to Slide 25, our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We've been investing rental fleet CapEx in specific areas of need, notably in relation to our COVID-19 response efforts, and inside of our specialty business in general. This disciplined focus remains important as we manage the supply side of the market both in terms of landings and disposals.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15074,Presentation,"As covered in the highlights, our Greenfield program is now back to a healthy pace, and we are on path to open 25 to 30 Greenfields in the year, 75% of which will be specialty businesses. As a result of improved demand characteristics and recommencing our Greenfield program, we've increased our full year CapEx guidance to 650 million to 700 million. The usual detail by business unit can be found in the appendix.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15075,Presentation,"Consistent with our last update, we've not closed on or entered into agreement to add any bolt-ons. However, our business development team continues to assess opportunities and will act when the opportunity fits our strategy and aligns from a capital allocation and leverage perspective. We maintained our interim dividend of 7.15 P and the resumption of our buyback program remains in review with respect to timing.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15076,Presentation,"So, to bring things to a conclusion on Slide 26, our business has performed well and demonstrated clearly the inherent resiliency and a diverse rental business, and indeed elements of growth in this unprecedented market environment. Our focus remains on delivering positively for all of our stakeholders.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15077,Presentation,"We're operating from a position of strength in all geographies we serve, and we?ll continue to take advantage of the apparent and ongoing structural change in our space as we further develop and broaden our end markets. We're pleased with our performance, but we are not losing sight of the work ahead nor the broader economic and near-term construction market uncertainty.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15078,Presentation,"The record levels of free cash flow our operations generated should not be overlooked. Our competence never wavered in our model?s ability to generate strong free cash flow. This allowed for ongoing investment in current and future business opportunities, while quickly bringing leverage to the lower half of our target range. The results in this period and strength in our market position allows us to look to the future with confidence.",Brendan Horgan,4393601

15079,Presentation,,Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15080,Presentation,"And with that, Operator, we will now open the lines for Q&A.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15081,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Andrew Wilson of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.,Operator,4393601
,,,,
15082,Question-and-Answer,"Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I just have a question on the UK. Looking at the guidance for the full year versus the kind of run rate we see in the first-half, just trying to understand obviously, what's a fairly significant pickup in terms of implied second-half run-rate? And just I guess how much of that relates to healthcare and how much of that you have visibility? I'm just trying to get a kind of your understanding on the pickup.",Andrew Wilson,4393601
,,,,
15083,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. Sure, Andrew. Good morning. If you look at really if you go to Slide 23, I think that top right chart illustrates it pretty well. And as I would have just covered when we got into the later part of Q2, so the September-October time period from an underlying standpoint, we were back to where we were the prior year. So when you really look at the crossover there and that gap between last year and this current year, most of that year-on-year growth is attributed to the DOH response. So certainly, our indication in the business with our customers both the sort of service contractors and the government alike, there is obviously a continuing of the testing sites and will certainly be a degree of vaccination sites as well.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15084,Question-and-Answer,"So we expect that to continue throughout the year, which is a certainly a big contributor to that year-on-year delta. But again, I'll point out that underlying the strength of some of the infrastructure work that we have going on and also just the more we see that business diversify through these Project Unify efforts.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15085,Question-and-Answer,"That's great. If I can switch across, I guess probably it?s a U.S. centric question. But the fleet side that you provided in terms of seeing the level of reduction there. And I guess I'm interested, if you have any visibility on -- is that the same set of companies i.e. companies reducing their fleet? Or does it include competitors who might have exited the industry for one reason or another? And I guess, just sort of maybe go ahead.",Andrew Wilson,4393601
,,,,
15086,Question-and-Answer,"No, go ahead, Andrew. I'm sorry.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15087,Question-and-Answer,"No, it just sort of a broader question maybe to tag on then is just any comment around sort of changes in competitive behavior I guess would be interesting.",Andrew Wilson,4393601
,,,,
15088,Question-and-Answer,"Sure. Well, from a fleet standpoint, look, I think that Slide 19 is really an important one to understand. We talked about discipline and as we've talked about for a number of years now, one big question has been how will the industry perform from a rate standpoint, as it relates to discipline. Well, certainly the key ingredient when it comes to rate discipline is managing the overall supply side of the equation, i.e. supply and demand. This particular makeup of companies is like for like.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15089,Question-and-Answer,"So what you see there, it's plus or minus 220 rental companies in North America that makes up about half of the overall fleet that's in the industry. So that is indeed a like for like. And what you see there is about, as I said, a 3 billion variants in November compared to last year, which is no small number on a fleet size that was -- this is from memory, but 57 billion a year ago, and it's 54 billion today.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15090,Question-and-Answer,"So that discipline that we've seen in terms of managing that spot. Keep in mind too, think back to our updates to the market and go back to this very time last fiscal year. So be pre any thought whatsoever of COVID and you'll recall, we would have taken down our CapEx at the time, that was more really getting that in line with what we saw from a forecast standpoint on the smaller but yet meaningful construction side of our business. So certainly, we've seen that and that's why I said, probably a bit premature to say, okay, we have demonstrated through the entire period of the cycle, meaning the sort of suppressed period that the industry has remained discipline. But we can confidently say in nine months? time it has.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15091,Question-and-Answer,,Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15092,Question-and-Answer,"I think the biggest thing if I were to take away from Slide 19, which is of course not in the actual words, but think about nine months? time, so this March to November period, where we have seen remarkable discipline in rate for all the reasons that I just mentioned. If we go back to '08 to '09, if we go to the first nine months, so when we began to see the businesses and the industry slowdown, in that very same nine months? time, we experienced a 20% decline in rental rates. And here, we've been through this period, and we have not gone down a point one. So I think that speaks to what we're seeing in terms of behavior in the industry.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15093,Question-and-Answer,"No, that's very clear. Maybe if I can just squeeze one final one in, it's just around these the equipment and obviously the impact they had on the margin, as Michael hopefully pointed out. I guess, just quick question, would we expect that to be a trend in the next couple of quarters? Or is that, when we think about these mix impacts and impact on the margin just to try and think about that for this kind of balance of the year maybe?",Andrew Wilson,4393601
,,,,
15094,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, Michael will be following after that, but yes, I think we're seeing a -- we saw a bit of a decline in second hand values, particularly through the auction channel early on. Let's face it, we were coming off of what we probably thought were abnormal pitch, we're in the low 40% as a low 40s as a percentage of OEC when we disposed, and now we're kind of in the mid-30s.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15095,Question-and-Answer,"But I think encouragingly we saw the auction trends tick up a bit over the last couple of months. But yes, I would say we're in that more of the same as we go throughout the year having similar effects from a margin standpoint.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15096,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, I guess purely from the max perspective is always going to be a drag at the moment, because we are selling. We're selling in accordance with what we planned to sell, which is more from an OEC perspective than a year ago. And just generically, margins are lower on used equipment sales, so it will continue to have an impact.",Michael Pratt,4393601
,,,,
15097,Question-and-Answer,"Makes perfect sense. Thanks for the time, guys. I appreciate it.",Andrew Wilson,4393601
,,,,
15098,Question-and-Answer,"Thanks, Andrew.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15099,Question-and-Answer,Okay. We now go to the line of Rory McKenzie of UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.,Operator,4393601
,,,,
15100,Question-and-Answer,"Good morning, all. It's Rory here. Just two for me, please on specialty firstly. So on the short-term trends, thanks for breaking out the hurricane impacts. Similarly just wondered how much is maybe short-term COVID related contracts and what the visibility is there and are continuing?",Rory McKenzie,4393601
,,,,
15101,Question-and-Answer,"And then secondly, how is this year, if it's all changed your view on specialty rental penetration, which of those markets on Slide 16 to 17 have turned rental for the first time this year? And why? Or what have you found you can replace these customers? Is it different to what you were thinking even just a year ago? Thank you.",Rory McKenzie,4393601
,,,,
15102,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. Thanks, Rory. From a term standpoint, I think the way to look at it, well, it shows quite clearly on Slide 13. We had that significant impact as it relates to the incredibly active hurricane season more so than ever before. And what we saw was similar to what we experienced in November, it's been basically 9%, 10% really throughout the calendar year. What do we see from a visibility standpoint? A lot more of the same, frankly. We really got pretty granular didn't we, in terms of the examples that we showed you on the slides, you referenced Slide 16 and Slide 17. And we're just seeing that overall, very large MRO space. So from a facility standpoint, municipal standpoint, et cetera, those examples I had given. We're seeing more and more traction as it relates to that.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15103,Question-and-Answer,"If you think about and this is very, very significantly driven by our specialty, when we look at our overall customer makeup, you heard us say so many times about how diverse our end markets are, and our customers therefore are and what is a very large and broad market. If I were to give you a for instance, and look at our top customers through the fiscal year, if I were to read off top five, one would be MRO, 100% facility related, the second would be a municipalities through a buying group, the third would be emergency response, the fourth would be utility, having nothing to do with capital projects all MRO, and then the fifth would be an industrial MRO.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15104,Question-and-Answer,,Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15105,Question-and-Answer,"And then if you round out the top 20, you'll have three data center customers in there. So you have this incredibly diverse customer base. I mean, even the top five make up less than 3% of our overall revenue. But to give you an example, to answer your second question and instead of referencing one of the two slides, I just did, I'm actually going to turn to the appendix, Slide 37 to speak to you obviously one of our favorites here, which is this flooring business. Because you asked the question, are we seeing anything different, that all along we knew that there would be opportunities during certain periods to amplify if you will, the shift from ownership to rental, and that's exactly what we're seeing?",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15106,Question-and-Answer,"So during these times, when you get a sort of unplanned increase in demand, and I'm speaking about the customer here, and you've got that optionality since we now have some scale in these specialty businesses like flooring between the long-term commitment and cost there in and ownership versus the immediate flexibility we give them in rental. If you look at that top left example, this is just a national retailer. And just in six months, 185 of their locations they've chosen to rent rather than buy sweepers and scrubbers. So that is to me the epitome of the example of what we were anticipating. We couldn't do that three years ago, because we didn't have the scale on the business. But today, Adam who leads our flooring business has in his arsenal lots of fleet and a number of locations, which we're adding to every month.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15107,Question-and-Answer,"Right. No, that's really interesting. And just one last one on the rates. It's great the aggregate picture is staying stable. But I imagine some segments are seeing rates going to well up, climate control maybe there's this flooring for example. So what are the weakest areas to rate at the moment? What are you seeing in say the traditional construction, skid steer loaders, that kind of stuff?",Rory McKenzie,4393601
,,,,
15108,Question-and-Answer,"Rory, I have to say that's not what's happening. We are very conscious of how we price our specialty. You've got to -- we're driving rental penetration. So we don't see across the board increases of any magnitude in specialty. We see moderate increases as we go through. When we look at our general tool business, we see incredibly flat rates. When we are going through agreement renewals, et cetera, we are disciplined in going into that. The only pocket really where we're seeing any rate degradation is in upstream, which you would expect it's not enormous. But that's really it.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15109,Question-and-Answer,"So even in the general tool business, through this time this may surprise some listening. Our activity levels are actually increasing. In the quarter, we wrote 3% more contracts year-on-year than we did the last year. Now, what that tells you is you've got more ins and outs with some of our customer base. But what would have been more traditional say, non-res construction where you may have had a longer duration, we're doing a lot of work in some of the home improvement and homebuilding space that has led to a lot of activity, and therefore, underpinning the stability in rate.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15110,Question-and-Answer,Great. That's all very reassuring. Thank you very much.,Rory McKenzie,4393601
,,,,
15111,Question-and-Answer,"Thanks, Rory.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15112,Question-and-Answer,We now go to the line of Will Kirkness of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.,Operator,4393601
,,,,
15113,Question-and-Answer,"Thanks very much. Good morning. Two for me, please as well. And just to pick up on my current outlook and more contracts. Has anything changed in the normal pattern of starts and cancellations? Just to get a sense of whether the work that's coming through is essentially sort of pre-COVID work, especially on the construction side. Or whether just you are seeing new contracts coming through post-COVID? And I guess your CapEx raise does signal some competence in the medium-term.",Will Kirkness,4393601
,,,,
15114,Question-and-Answer,,Will Kirkness,4393601
,,,,
15115,Question-and-Answer,"And the second question was just on market share gains, it's been referenced a few times. Clearly, your performance has been better than peers. But I do think you're taking share from both large and as well as smaller operators. Thanks.",Will Kirkness,4393601
,,,,
15116,Question-and-Answer,"Sure. Thanks, Will, and good morning. When it comes to activity, obviously we saw the forecasted change from our last update into this update from a put in place standpoint. Starts were down just a bit compared to what they were. There are lots of puts and takes in those, i.e. we see continued momentum around warehouse, healthcare, data centers, et cetera. And certainly there's some headwind as it relates to hotels, leisure et cetera.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15117,Question-and-Answer,"I think the way to look at it is, there's still a bit of time to pass to get a firm grasp on what we might see in terms of overall starts in 2021. But one thing I like to look at, this isn't something that we share, it's pretty granular, but we look, as you know, we?ll in all the geographies we serve even down to individual sales territory or zip code in the U.S., we look at actually projects entering bid. So, projects that -- if you have a project on the books for planning, it's one thing to have a project on the books for planning. When you go from the planning to actually underbid, it's very unlikely that you collect bids and you don't begin.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15118,Question-and-Answer,"And what we have seen as you can imagine or if you can think about it in terms of sequence of time, obviously, in the March, April, May timeframe, we saw a big disconnect in 2020 projects entering bid versus '18 and '19. And really, ever since the July really August timeframe, we've seen real consistency in the 2020 projects entering bid just in count, this isn't in dollars.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15119,Question-and-Answer,"But in counts is a good indication, where it's been week to week hovering very closely to 2018. So, a bit lower than 2019, but very much like 2018, so that is I think it's a reasonably reassuring way of looking at things. When it comes to share, it's very difficult to tell precisely who the share is coming from. Obviously, our U.S. listed peers give us some indication they are in.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15120,Question-and-Answer,"But I think the biggest thing in all of it is, we are seeing a significant flight to quality. So, that probably speaks to us taking a disproportionate amount of share from some of the little?s and middles or independence as we would refer to them as. Customers are looking for our mantra availability, reliability and ease, but availability, reliability and ease coupled with confidence that we're doing the right things. We're doing the right things in terms of safeguarding our customers when we make deliveries, the way that we do, touchless transactions, electronic signatures, the ability to order online, those sort of things. So I would say that a big helping of our market share gains is coming from the independence.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15121,Question-and-Answer,That's great. Thanks so much.,Will Kirkness,4393601
,,,,
15122,Question-and-Answer,"Thanks, Will.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15123,Question-and-Answer,"We now go to the line of Arnaud Lehman of Bank of America. Please go ahead, sir. Your line is now open.",Operator,4393601
,,,,
15124,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you very much. Good morning, gentlemen. Firstly, coming back on general tools, could you take us through the value sub segments you referred to housing that seems strong? And it's interesting that you're able to capture that. And maybe what's happening in the other segments, non-residential or infrastructure spending? That's my first question.",Arnaud Lehman,4393601
,,,,
15125,Question-and-Answer,"And my second question, just coming back on your greenfield opening, I think you mentioned you have 12 greenfield in the period. I mean it?s not a huge number, but you're back to growth. So what are the key drivers? Is it more specialty? Or are you just coming back to your usual plan of having both general tools and specialty and the greenfields?",Arnaud Lehman,4393601
,,,,
15126,Question-and-Answer,"Sure. Good morning, Arnaud. Let me start with your second one, because it's an easy one to answer quickly. Yes, we're back to a reasonable cadence, not as fast as we could do. You'll see that increase typically as we go into next fiscal year. But it is by a specialty, as we said 75% of those businesses are specialty. And the reason we're doing that is because you strike while the iron is hot.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15127,Question-and-Answer,,Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15128,Question-and-Answer,"There is a pull from our customers to expand our coverage and capabilities in those specialty businesses, whether that be power and HVAC, climate control, flooring, scaffold, all those areas we are moving to take advantage of the opportune position we find ourselves in.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15129,Question-and-Answer,"When it comes to the general tool and the various moving pieces in construction, if you will, now, before I get into construction, let me remind you that as we continue to grow the business in specialty as you've seen, and really when we speak to that fly that you'll notice we talked to before construction because it is a bigger end market to us, the MRO space, entertainment and emergency response as we further penetrate those markets. And we have that long, long list of markets that we service. Our general tool business gets opportunities there because the products we carry inside of the general tool business have vast applications if you sort of have the entree into those markets like we do with our specialty business.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15130,Question-and-Answer,"When you look at construction overall, there are a number of ways to look at it. But if you look at from a building start standpoint you say, okay, where are we forecasted to be in 2021. And 2021 looks like from a start standpoint, something like 2017 levels. I think something that's incredibly interesting to look at is just the overall building starts actual in 2020, and also forecasted '21through 2025, when you just look at square footage started. So in 2021, for instance, we will start 4.2 billion square feet of construction if the forecasts are correct.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15131,Question-and-Answer,"Now, the makeup of that construction, of course, is different. Do you see as much as I referenced earlier in hotels and in sort of entertainment? No, you don't, or front street retail. What you see is front street retail being replaced by warehouse distribution and fulfillment. And of course, we're seeing a very healthy injection that probably not many saw coming in the early days of COVID from a single family housing standpoint. So you see how the forecast and starts are going to be dwelling that is about 1.4 million units, which is going to be about 900,000 single family and 500,000 multifamily.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15132,Question-and-Answer,"And I speak to that single family in particular, because of some of the activity I mentioned earlier following Rory's question. And also, when you think about that sort of scale of single family, what you get is you get bigger actual developments. So it's not a one off house here or there. It's actually a neighborhood and a neighborhood requires the utilities underground, and it requires the sort of infrastructure work if you will, that goes along with it.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15133,Question-and-Answer,"And whether or not there will be a grocery store nearby or front street retail as I said, there will be something to service that. And if it comes in the form of town centers, fine. If it comes in the form of more distribution centers to bring something to someone's doorstep, that's fine as well.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15134,Question-and-Answer,"So look, there are a lot of moving parts, but I think what we're really trying to get across is we're just agile, our products in general or by definition are and we are as well in terms of how we point to those markets.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15135,Question-and-Answer,That's very clear. Thank you very much.,Arnaud Lehman,4393601
,,,,
15136,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. We now go to the line of Robert Wertheimer of Melius Research. Please go ahead, sir. Your line is now open.",Operator,4393601
,,,,
15137,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you. Hey, everyone. You've had a remarkable year really, I mean, I think the industry and you especially proved out some of the worries people worried about the downside a year and two and many years ago. So it's really been remarkable. And congratulations to all your employees. Brendan you kind of outlined, shift back to growth. You talked about the MRO opportunity in some of these big end markets. ",Robert Wertheimer,4393601
,,,,
15138,Question-and-Answer,"I'm a little bit curious, when you look at that opportunity, it seems like you're saying you have years and years of growth ahead. Do you anticipate having a materially different business mix different products that's to sort of tackle those opportunities? Or does those [Indiscernible] afford you ample growth within the products you have? And just, do you envision the business looking kind of different in a few years?",Robert Wertheimer,4393601
,,,,
15139,Question-and-Answer,,Robert Wertheimer,4393601
,,,,
15140,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. Good morning, Rob. I appreciate the kind words. You're going to see a continuation of our specialty business which addresses those markets, you just went over and we highlighted in the results. There is the underlying driver of that is plain and simple really, and that is just the structural change, most specifically that being the shift from ownership to rental.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15141,Question-and-Answer,"I think that we are highlighting how much if you will, individuals in that space look for some degree of optionality. And I think some don't quite realize. There was just no choice other than ownership before. And now you have a reliable choice in terms of rental versus ownership. So do I think the mix changes in the years to come? The question is absolutely, yes.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15142,Question-and-Answer,"Look, when we see a resurgence in non-res construction in the couple of years down the road to come, will we happily and knowingly invest in that? Absolutely. A more general tool business is a benefit as a result of that? Yes. The big thing is, is the understanding of how big actually these specialty businesses can come as we exploit this incredibly broad end market that we've just spoken to. And I think that's the part that will answer your question emphatically. Our specialty business, as you'll see in plain color, if you will at our April Capital Markets Day, look, that business can be the size of our business today in total. So that's probably the shortest or quickest way to put it. And we will continue to exploit that opportunity in that shift from ownership to rental, as we bring our specialty products closer to our customers in all the markets that we serve.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15143,Question-and-Answer,That does calculate it very well. Thank you very much. I look forward to the Investor Day. It should be exciting. Thanks.,Robert Wertheimer,4393601
,,,,
15144,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, likewise. Thanks, Rob.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15145,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. So we now go to the line of Edward Stanley at Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, sir. Your line is now open.",Operator,4393601
,,,,
15146,Question-and-Answer,"Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. A decent chunk of your specialty CapEx has gone into air filtration, that was still amongst other things, if my memory serves me. Is there any risk that you'll suddenly find a load of that underutilized specialty assets in a year's time post COVID? Or do you make so much money on such a short window of intense uses that actually it doesn't matter in a year's time what the utilization is on those either tickets?",Edward Stanley,4393601
,,,,
15147,Question-and-Answer,"And the second question on leverage around the buyback, I guess. You mentioned that leverage is as low in October as you could reasonably hope for excluding COVID. So why you are so hesitant about the timing on a buyback? Is that acquisitions in the pipeline greenfields that absolutely become first? Or can we expect a healthy balance of everything in the coming months?",Edward Stanley,4393601
,,,,
15148,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, sure. From the air filtration products, will we -- I'm not so sure about calendar 2021 in terms of time utilization, I'll expect it to remain rather robust. I think, actually, for a number of years thereafter, it will remain healthy. It doesn't take much in terms of time utilization to produce good dollar utilization when it comes to those products. So, is this better than it will be ordinarily? I would hesitate to say anything but that.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15149,Question-and-Answer,"But one thing to understand that's key, if you look at for instance, not perhaps the air filtration that we see today in terms of air purification, but for years and years, pre-COVID, we increased the size of our air scrubbers, and we increased the size of our air scrubber fleet to service a vast array of end markets, whether it be remediation, whether it be all sorts of agriculture and some of the markets that we're in, like California and Colorado, if you know what I mean.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15150,Question-and-Answer,"So, when we look at the remediation side around our humidifiers and our corporate bands, we grow that fleet every single year by 15%, 20%, all because there is underlying demand there, and if we don't, then some customers are forced to buy rather than rent and we want to remain incredibly reliable as it relates to that. So it's a specialty business that we focus on significantly in our climate control and air quality business, and we will continue to do so. I think you'll see rental penetration get even higher there.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15151,Question-and-Answer,,Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15152,Question-and-Answer,"When it comes to leverage and buybacks. Sure, we could debate. Do we begin our buybacks on the results of today? I think it's our way of saying, we're being prudent as we go through all this. Remember, yes. Michael just addressed that our leverage is at 1.7, which it has to round up to. So it's a bit lower than that. But it was 1.9 something just six months ago. So we've taken it down swiftly. And why wouldn't you wait and see just a little bit longer what's going on out there before you get that going again, perhaps we're a bit closer to the lower end of that range than the middle end of that range.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15153,Question-and-Answer,"This is a year that in many ways, certainly no one would have wished this horribly sad pandemic on anyone. But remember, we had to demonstrate in our business, we had to demonstrate the cash, we had to demonstrate the resiliency and we had to also demonstrate our own discipline and therefore the industry's and that's what we're focused on right now. I think, you'll find in the not too distant future, we'll take a decision on buybacks.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15154,Question-and-Answer,Okay. Thank you.,Edward Stanley,4393601
,,,,
15155,Question-and-Answer,Okay. So we now go to the line of Andy Murphy at Panmure Gordon. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.,Operator,4393601
,,,,
15156,Question-and-Answer,"Good morning, gentlemen. And thank you for taking the questions. I've got three if I may. First one on the whole COVID situation, I was wondering whether you could talk a little bit about how sticky some of the revenues that have come through on that basis are. And whether they might, if they do fall away actually lead to other sort of adjacent business streams along the way?",Andy Murphy,4393601
,,,,
15157,Question-and-Answer,"And [indiscernible] COVID question about working practices and whether you unearthed [ph] new work and practices perhaps the better and cheap, and provide savings that you'll stick with longer-term.",Andy Murphy,4393601
,,,,
15158,Question-and-Answer,"Secondly, just wondering about the M&A landscape, you've obviously not done any deals in the period. But I was wondering whether you share a little bit of color on whether other businesses have been struggling and opportunities are in the pipeline present, and a word if you can around expected pricing. And then finally, if you don?t mind, just a little comment on the state aid investigation that you mentioned in the statement. Just a little bit of color around that how Brexit may impact some of the outcome of your peer? Thank you.",Andy Murphy,4393601
,,,,
15159,Question-and-Answer,"Sure, Andy. So to begin with your first which is around COVID and the sticky revenues, I like that term. I'll default to begin with to just a continuation of rental penetration, particularly in our specialty business. So as we've seen now for over a decade in our overall business, once businesses begin the migration from ownership to rental, it's very difficult to turn that ship around. They will become reliant on that. They will re-gear their own businesses to be set up more for rental rather than ownership.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15160,Question-and-Answer,"And the most basic example is there, as you know, when you own equipment, it means you're responsible for maintenance or repair. And when you rent equipment, you're not responsible for maintenance and repair. So over time, you don?t keep spare parts on shelves, you use that space for something else. You don't have the technicians, you don't have that sort of thing. So that will continue.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15161,Question-and-Answer,"Definitely, I think across all the geographies that we serve, our stature continues to change. So when it comes to that flight to quality I mentioned earlier, I mean, look at our UK business, look at the enormity of the task over 250,000 tangible assets that they have deployed in response to Department of Health. When you pull off that order of magnitude, and you all of a sudden are thought of in that way, do you then do better on projects like infrastructure? I'd say we will. Do you do better with businesses that are in the facility maintenance space that need things of very, very broad range and product and very, very broad range in terms of geographically where their service, I think that they will. So that's how I would answer that.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15162,Question-and-Answer,,Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15163,Question-and-Answer,"When it comes to M&A, I think Michael alluded to it in his comments. Our discussions are increasing. So we're closer to doing some bolt-ons, then further away. There's some really nice little businesses out there that if we can come to terms with the owners, I think you'll find we'll move forward. We're not doing anything earth shattering, it is very much on the plan that we have had for quite some time now. So there are some nice ones that fill out some geographic areas for us or advance our filling out of a cluster, and some nice little specialty businesses that can augment our growth in that regard.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15164,Question-and-Answer,"So it's not going to be anything significant in terms of overall scale, but I do think it will demonstrate how we prioritize our capital allocation. All along, we've been investing in our existing businesses, both in replacement and in growth, as Michael will have covered. And the next logical thing there after the greenfields, which of course was our second is to augment that with bolt-on. And I would say, yes, as we've gone through this period, there are some opportunities that are out there.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15165,Question-and-Answer,"When it comes to Brexit and Michael may have something to chime in here on your point from a technical standpoint. Let's face it. Whenever there is a degree of uncertainty in markets, people turn more to rental than prior points. And when they do that, it creates opportunity. And if you look at what may happen as it relates specifically to Brexit, and where there may be work, I think it's reasonable to think that you would see some injection from an infrastructure standpoint. And if that's the case, no one in the United Kingdom is better positioned than we are, not least of which understanding that we've kept our entire workforce intact through this period, and which means we are very much so on the ready. And as you'll see, we've continued to invest in that business.",Brendan Horgan,4393601
,,,,
15166,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, I mean, I'm just picking up specifically on the state aid point, that is to do with history, so it's a legacy thing. So it will still get dealt with. It's a ruling from EU whereby we don't agree without doing a lot of other companies down to agree with another appeal that HMRC has appealed it, and it's going through its process. So, if it totally went against those, you'll see we disclose what the maximum potential liability is. But as I say, we believe we complied with the UK requirements as they were at the time, as they do a lot of other companies. So it will have to just work its way through. But the 36 is the maximum exposure.",Michael Pratt,4393601

,,,,
15181,Presentation,"From a macro perspective, this past election season, saw still more jurisdictions during the growing chorus of states that have legalized adult use of medical cannabis. Additionally, about 67% of the country, a bipartisan majority, now support legalization and we saw the historic passage of the more act in the house representatives just last week. We?re optimistic that 2021 will continue to bring good news for the cannabis industry and we?ll continue to work towards a world where cannabis is legal and regulated.",Tom Lynch,4393501
,,,,
15182,Presentation,,Tom Lynch,4393501
,,,,
15183,Presentation,"In addition to states legalizing adult use of medical cannabis, we?re excited about the local progress in our core market in California, where several new cities that are in close proximity to our existing footprint approved cannabis measures.",Tom Lynch,4393501
,,,,
15184,Presentation,"This week we?re also pleased to announce the addition of Tracy McCourt to our executive team as our new Chief Revenue Officer. She will lead the omnichannel marketing strategy, as well as the company?s buying, merchandising and business intelligence efforts.

,,,,
15185,Presentation,"The unique experience and success in customer targeting and retention will be invaluable to MedMen, as we move into this next chapter of our business. Tracy is a tremendous hire for MedMen and it speaks volumes to not only where MedMen is as a company right now, but the exponential potential for our company in the future. Our ability to attract and retain exceptional talent will continue to be a differentiator for MedMen against our competitors.",Tom Lynch,4393501
,,,,
15186,Presentation,"With that, let?s jump into discussing our fiscal first quarter which was a transformative one for the business across a number of fronts and place us ahead of schedule with respect to our turnaround plan.",Tom Lynch,4393501
,,,,
15187,Presentation,"The primary goal of the turnaround plan was to improve the financial profile of the business, particularly in our core retail business. While we made significant progress over the past six months, external factors, such as COVID and the rioting, which led to store closures last quarter impacted the timing of achieving our turnaround milestones. This quarter was a much different story for us and surpassed even our internal expectations.",Tom Lynch,4393501
,,,,
15188,Presentation,"We?re excited to announce that during our first quarter, we generated $36 million in revenue, representing a 30% increase from the previous quarter, driven by a strong quarter in California where revenue grew by 34%.",Tom Lynch,4393501
,,,,
15189,Presentation,"In addition to growing revenue, we?re able to see the fruits of all the hard work with respect to our optimization efforts. Our retail gross margin surpassed 54% and while we?re not quite there yet on the company-wide positive adjusted EBITDA, we are able to achieve a $12 million improvement from last quarter, bringing our adjusted EBITDA loss to approximately $12 million, the best quarter ever for the company. This is also the first quarter in which we achieved positive cash flow after-tax across our retail footprint, a significant milestone for the team.",Tom Lynch,4393501
,,,,
15190,Presentation,"In addition to optimizing our retail model, right sizing our corporate infrastructure was the next biggest task. At its peak, the company?s corporate related SG&A was approximately $160 million. Over the past several quarters, we?ve continued to chip away at that and I?m excited to announce that our corporate SG&A this quarter was just over $40 million. We?ve done all of this while improving overall efficiency, upgrading talent across the organization and maintaining our growth prospects.",Tom Lynch,4393501
,,,,
15191,Presentation,The next big priority was to strengthen the balance sheet of the company by first deferring as lending cash to limits as possible and then attracting capital from both new and existing capital partners.,Tom Lynch,4393501
,,,,
15192,Presentation,"During the quarter, we executed lender and landlord support agreements to defer $32 million in interest in rent over the next 12 months, while also modifying certain covenants for additional flexibility. Further evidence of the belief our capital partners have the long-term value of the business.",Tom Lynch,4393501
,,,,
15193,Presentation,"The next step was to raise additional funds. During the quarter we announced $20 million in new financing commitments across a few different facilities. Our investors later upsize this commitment to $26 million because of the positive development in the current quarter, while there?s still work to be done on strengthening our cash position, we believe we are more investable than ever with a true line of sight to profitability.",Tom Lynch,4393501
,,,,
15194,Presentation,,Tom Lynch,4393501
,,,,
15195,Presentation,"Lastly, while this is a turnaround situation that requires a standard turnaround playbook of rightsizing the cost structure, eliminating liabilities and narrowing down the focus of the company. The most exciting part about this whole for me is being able to evolve the turnaround story into growth work.",Tom Lynch,4393501
,,,,
15196,Presentation,"We?ve been able to build the most recognized brand in the industry and while we?ve had to hit pause on new store openings and expansions into new markets, we?re well-positioned to begin planning for an acceleration of growth in existing markets such as California and Florida, where we have the number of high profile stores set to open over the next 12 months, as well as new markets like Massachusetts where we have some of the best locations in the state.",Tom Lynch,4393501
,,,,
15197,Presentation,We?re pleased with how much we?ve been able to execute in a short amount of time. It also understands the urgency in which our shareholders and capital apartments expect us to turn the company around. We take this responsibility extremely seriously and I appreciate the patience. I look forward to continuing leading this company to the next chapter and we?ll continue to share updates as they develop.,Tom Lynch,4393501
,,,,
15198,Presentation,"With that, I?ll hand it over to Tim Bossidy our COO for operational highlights.",Tom Lynch,4393501
,,,,
15199,Presentation,"Thank you, Tom. First, I like Tom and incredibly excited about the progress we continue to make here at MedMen. Our first quarter results are a testament to the tireless work put in by each team here. We are building a foundation for sustainable growth and continue to execute on the turnaround plan.",Tim Bossidy,4393501
,,,,
15200,Presentation,"As Tom mentioned, our focus is on driving retail profitability. We do not want this to be interpreted as the only place he focus operationally. We have the same laser focus across the business. But improving and removing complexity from our supply chain and our cultivation facilities, it shows up in our primary KPI, retail cash flow.",Tim Bossidy,4393501
,,,,
15201,Presentation,"Generating significant cash flow from our retail footprint and then expanding our footprint in disciplined manner will not only limit the financings and dilution required to cover our corporate overhead, but will begin to generate capital to invest in new store openings in addition to marketing efforts. Retail cash flow will be what spin is a flywheel and accelerates the growth of the MedMen brand.",Tim Bossidy,4393501
,,,,
15202,Presentation,"With respect to retail revenue, there are a number of initiatives we put into place over the past several months, which were drivers of some of the revenue growth we saw this quarter. As mentioned last quarter, we?ve made significant changes to how we think about marketing to our customers and we continue to focus on the high ROI customer connection.",Tim Bossidy,4393501
,,,,
15203,Presentation,"Over the past several months, we have been extremely disciplined on allocation of budget to marketing, while we redefined our assortment and learned about our change customer base. We continue to learn and as we do, we will grow our budget in a targeted manner.",Tim Bossidy,4393501
,,,,
15204,Presentation,"As we mentioned last call, MedMen have shied away from third-party listing services that represent a jumping off point for millions of cannabis consumers and patients. This past quarter, we successfully integrated a number of these services into our POS systems and have successfully boosted awareness with local customers. Return on this spent and these integration efforts are starting to appear.",Tim Bossidy,4393501
,,,,
15205,Presentation,"Our local customer base has also benefited from the changes we?ve made with respect to our curation and buying process. Our emphasis is on having the best product and improving availability of high earnings piece for our customers, which in turn is boosted in sale conversion.",Tim Bossidy,4393501
,,,,
15206,Presentation,"With respect to one of our key medical markets, Florida, we are shifting our focus to educating physicians on how our products are the safest and highest quality to recommend to their patients. That, plus our increasing cultivation yield and higher flower quality has resulted in an average revenue per box of $3 million to $4 million, representing continuing double-digit growth rates month-over-month.",Tim Bossidy,4393501
,,,,
15207,Presentation,,Tim Bossidy,4393501
,,,,
15208,Presentation,"As a management team, we are highly confident in our ability to continue scaling revenue. It is our firm belief that as the economic environment improves and the pandemic is better managed and controlled, our improved assortment, customer experience and marketing initiatives will drive continued revenue growth during the remainder of fiscal 2021.",Tim Bossidy,4393501
,,,,
15209,Presentation,"Turning to our main retail cost drivers, I will discuss four key initiatives that we were able to achieve during the quarter. The biggest improvement we made was related to our sourcing of product. Our gross margins at retail surpassed 54%, the highest they?ve ever been.",Tim Bossidy,4393501
,,,,
15210,Presentation,"We?ve been able to secure best-in-class pricing in terms of our key vendors through improved communication, transparency and partnership. We believe it is a mutually beneficial relationship. Our vendors are thrilled by our revamped buying and allocation process, but more importantly, to them, our stores are in place for discovery and for the highest quality products. So for our partners, our shelves provide an appreciable lift to the brands.",Tim Bossidy,4393501
,,,,
15211,Presentation,"In terms of payroll, our second biggest four wall cost. The dynamic staffing model we discussed on the last call continues to provide cost savings, with payroll as a percentage of revenue down approximately 4 points than the previous quarter, with California leading the way. Through our efforts from the start of the turnaround plan, we?ve been able to save over $15 million on an annualized basis.",Tim Bossidy,4393501
,,,,
15212,Presentation,"In addition to payroll optimization, we are also undergoing a number of other enhancements to our stores that have chipped away at our retail cost structure, including changes to payment processing, and sourcing and store supplies.",Tim Bossidy,4393501
,,,,
15213,Presentation,"In aggregate, our continued execution on our four wall efforts has enabled us to achieve our first full quarter of being cash flow positive on an after-tax basis and an adjusted retail EBITDA margin of 19%.",Tim Bossidy,4393501
,,,,
15214,Presentation,"Next, I?d like to spend some time providing an update on progress in each market, starting with our recreational markets. As an update for California, while we continue to operate some of the best stores in the state, we plan to enhance our footprint further with two new stores in San Francisco, a new store in Emeryville and a new store in Pasadena. We?ve also nearly completed our LAX store expansion, already our highest growth and most profitable store in the state.",Tim Bossidy,4393501
,,,,
15215,Presentation,"Moving over to Nevada, we saw 192% increase in revenue this past quarter, if tourism began to return without the impact of state mandated closures due to COVID-19. As we look ahead, we will continue to evaluate new store opportunities in the broader Las Vegas market, given the tremendous brand synergies between Southern California and Vegas.",Tim Bossidy,4393501
,,,,
15216,Presentation,"With the tightness in the Nevada wholesale market, we also expect that the various cultivation partnerships we are working on will show up an improve revenue and margin in the coming quarters.",Tim Bossidy,4393501
,,,,
15217,Presentation,"In Illinois, our Oak Park location continues to perform extremely well. This location is the best performing store and the national portfolio in terms of revenue. During the quarter, we made the tough decision to sell our Evanston location. While we were excited about the prospects of the online market, given capital needs for the turnaround plan, the ability to bring in $20 million of cash proceeds in short order is highly attractive to us. We still expect to expand in that market as we evaluate the additional location associated with our Oak Park license.",Tim Bossidy,4393501
,,,,
15218,Presentation,Our final recreational market is Massachusetts. We?ve made significant progress here on the licensing front. We recently announced that the Massachusetts Cannabis Control Commission voted in favor of granting us provisional adult-used license in both our Fenway Park and Newton locations.,Tim Bossidy,4393501
,,,,
15219,Presentation,,Tim Bossidy,4393501
,,,,
15220,Presentation,"Moving on to our medical markets, we?re especially excited about Florida, which we believe can grow to be the second largest state for MedMen. We are proud to say, our shrink-to-grow plan continues to drive results. The current teams are usually doing a fantastic job improving both plant yield and quality.",Tim Bossidy,4393501
,,,,
15221,Presentation,"Yields continue to improve within our existing canopy, contesting results with improve genetics are showing significant gains. While we?ve always prided ourselves on producing the safest and cleanest flower available in Florida. We are now also slowing THC levels well into the 20% range and had a recent test over 30%. We?ll also be rolling out co-manufacturing agreements to add our momentum at this place [ph], they?ll be additive to our assortment, revenue and patient experience.",Tim Bossidy,4393501
,,,,
15222,Presentation,"I want to spend a second here on the growth pipeline in Florida as well. We believe that with a CapEx investment of under $5 million, we will be able to extend canopy enough to power up to an additional 10 locations opening in calendar ?21. And as a reminder, most of these stores are ready for almost ready to go. We have five locations currently mothballed and another four ready to go with minimal incremental CapEx dollars.",Tim Bossidy,4393501
,,,,
15223,Presentation,"Now the medical market, New York, we continue to operate four store locations, including our fifth avenue location, as well as our cultivation and manufacturing operation in Utica. We?ve seen an uptick in revenue and profitability across a New York asset as well, which is, again, reflective of a cohesive operational improvement that shows up in our retail profitability and cash flow.",Tim Bossidy,4393501
,,,,
15224,Presentation,"The last update I will provide is on our cultivation and manufacturing strategy going forward. During this first quarter, we announced the Atlanta Hawks report to pursue partnerships in California and Nevada facilities, DHS and Mustang. They?re close to the finish line of an agreement compare with a strong cultivation partner that would take operational and financial control of these sites and provide significant value to our retail stores through venue agreements and marketing agreements. In addition to supply agreements for our MedMen Red private label offering. This will be a highly synergistic partnership that we hope to share additional update on shortly.",Tim Bossidy,4393501
,,,,
15225,Presentation,And now I will turn it Zeeshan.,Tim Bossidy,4393501
,,,,
15226,Presentation,"Thank you, Tim. As a reminder, as of June 28, 2020, the company no longer met the qualification of the foreign private issuer as a result of more than 50% of the company?s outstanding voting shares being held by residents of the U.S. We are now considered a U.S. domestic issuer under the rules of the SEC. As such our financial statements for our first quarter fiscal 2021 just as they were last quarter or prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.",Zeeshan Hyder,4393501
,,,,
15227,Presentation,"Let?s jump into the financial. Consistent with prior quarters all the figures on today?s call are in U.S. dollars. In addition, I?ll refer to our topline performance in terms of system-wide revenue, as we believe that is the best representation of our economic progress. You can find the further information on these financial measures in MD&A for the first quarter. At a high level, this quarter is the best one we?ve had in terms of companywide in retail profitability and we are excited to share detail.",Zeeshan Hyder,4393501
,,,,
15228,Presentation,"System-wide revenue for our fiscal first quarter was $35.6 million, up 31% from $27.4 million from the previous quarter. Gross profit for the quarter was $16.1 million, leading to a gross margin of 47%, a 7-point increase over gross margin in the previous quarter. We continue to right-size our cost structure, corporate and at our storage facility.",Zeeshan Hyder,4393501
,,,,
15229,Presentation,"General and administrative expenses, which totaled $31.7 million, declined by 41% from the same period last year and 21% from the previous quarter. The improvement in G&A expenses was primarily driven by significant reduction in corporate-related expenses, including payroll, professional fees and deal cost.",Zeeshan Hyder,4393501
,,,,
15230,Presentation,,Zeeshan Hyder,4393501
,,,,
15231,Presentation,"Our first quarter adjusted corporate SG&A totaled approximately $10 million, a 66% decrease from the same period last year, when we were at $30 million in quarterly corporate SG&A spend. Even compared to the previous quarter, we saw a 29% decrease.",Zeeshan Hyder,4393501
,,,,
15232,Presentation,"While there are other additional optimization opportunities, we believe our corporate costs, which now sit at approximately $41 million on an annualized basis are the appropriate levels for both managing our existing asset base and supporting the growth we expect over the next 12 months to 18 months.",Zeeshan Hyder,4393501
,,,,
15233,Presentation,"Turning to profitability, we were able to cut our overall adjusted EBITDA loss in half this quarter, coming in at $11.7 million, compared to the previous quarter?s loss of $23.3 million. In the same period last year, our adjusted EBITDA loss was $32.4 million.",Zeeshan Hyder,4393501
,,,,
15234,Presentation,"As revenue continues to rebound from the early days of COVID-19 and as we move our cultivation and production partnership discussions of DHS and Mustang along, we believe there?s a clear path to achieving breakeven even, especially considering the retail profitability we were able to achieve this past quarter, which I?ll get into shortly.",Zeeshan Hyder,4393501
,,,,
15235,Presentation,"Overall, net loss and comprehensive loss attributable to shareholders of MedMen was $21.9 million or $0.06 per share, compared to $33.1 million or $0.15 per share in the previous year.",Zeeshan Hyder,4393501
,,,,
15236,Presentation,"Let?s now take a deeper look at our retail business. Retail revenue for the first quarter totaled $35.3 million, up to 29% sequentially. This increase in revenue was driven by our California footprint, which was up 34% this quarter over the previous quarter. Our flagship stores, such as LAX, Beverly Hills and West Hollywood were up 56%, 39% and 31%, respectively, during the quarter.",Zeeshan Hyder,4393501
,,,,
15237,Presentation,"Several factors contributed to the sequential increase in California. First, the lifting of shelter-in-place orders earlier this year resulted in increased store traffic into our store. Second, in the last quarter, we temporarily closed most of our California stores due to social unrest and rioting in May, which had a sizable impact on revenue. And third, our product assortment and quality has vastly improved over the past six months, which has been well received by the customer.",Zeeshan Hyder,4393501
,,,,
15238,Presentation,"It?s important to know that for this quarter, we?re only recognizing partial revenue for our Evanston retail store, because of our agreement divest the license to the third-party. Our pre-announced revenue number for this quarter of $37 million included a full quarter of Evanston revenue.",Zeeshan Hyder,4393501
,,,,
15239,Presentation,"Moving down to retail gross margin. We recorded our best quarter ever, 54% nationally and 56% in California. By consolidating our product portfolio we develop extremely strong relationships with our key vendors in each of our markets, on pricing and payment terms that are very favorable to MedMen. Even with all the progress over the past six months, there?s still significant opportunity to expand margin.",Zeeshan Hyder,4393501
,,,,
15240,Presentation,"In Illinois, we are still hovering around mid-40s, as that market normalizes we expect the retail gross margins north of 50%. The same holds true in Nevada, where margins still have room for improvement and as our Mustang partnership discussions move along, we anticipate our supply deals with the potential partner will allow us to move these margins up.",Zeeshan Hyder,4393501
,,,,
15241,Presentation,"In addition to retail gross margin we have made significant improvement in overall retail EBITDA as well. Our adjusted retail EB ITDA jumps to positive 19% this quarter from breakeven in the previous quarter, primarily driven by further payroll optimization and reductions in our store operating costs, such as payment processing.",Zeeshan Hyder,4393501
,,,,
15242,Presentation,"Even when factoring in federal, state and local taxes we were cash flow positive for the quarter across the retail for the first time in the company?s history. We are thrilled with the progress in our retail footprint and believe that as topline normalizes and our gross margins continue to pick up, we?ll put ourselves in a great position to cover our corporate costs and growth initiative since the capital we?re producing across our stores.",Zeeshan Hyder,4393501
,,,,
15243,Presentation,,Zeeshan Hyder,4393501
,,,,
15244,Presentation,"Moving on to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $10 million in cash and cash equivalent. There were a number of capital raising transactions we completed subsequent to the quarter end, including additional capital coming in under our unsecured convertible facility, as well as an upsize in our senior secured term loan. We continue to work closely with our capital partners to continue funding the business as we enter the homestretch of our turnaround plan.",Zeeshan Hyder,4393501
,,,,
15245,Presentation,"A quick note on our cap table as well. Given our multi-class structure, as of December 3rd, we had approximately 500.3 million subordinate voting shares and an additional 147.8 redeemable shares, which are convertible into subordinate voting shares on a one-to-one basis.",Zeeshan Hyder,4393501
,,,,
15246,Presentation,"To wrap up the prepared remarks, I along with the rest of the team are very optimistic and excited about what the rest of fiscal 2021 looks like for MedMen. We?ve made tremendous progress over the past year and while there?s still more work to do with a revamped team and board, a renewed focus on our retail business and additional capital, we are well-positioned to reach profitability this year and return to growth as a leader in cannabis retail within the U.S.",Zeeshan Hyder,4393501
,,,,
15247,Presentation,We will now open up the call to your question.,Zeeshan Hyder,4393501
,,,,
15248,Question-and-Answer,[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from a line of Vivien Azer from Cowen. Your line is open.,Operator,4393501
,,,,
15249,Question-and-Answer,"Hi. Good evening. Thanks for the question. So first one, Zeeshan just a housekeeping item, given that your reporting cycle is happening so late. Can you give us a more real time update on what your cash balance looks like?",Vivien Azer,4393501
,,,,
15250,Question-and-Answer,"Hey, Vivian. So in terms of what we announced post the quarter end, so we announced, as of the end of September, we had roughly $10 million or so on our balance sheet. Subsequent to the quarter end, we announced a couple of different financings. One was the increase under the Stable Road Hankey facility, which was around $7.7 million and then we drew down additional proceeds under our unsecured convertible facility of another a couple million or so. So that?s kind of what we announced post quarter end and then we?re also kind of working on new financings right now with our existing capital partners to bring additional funds in.",Zeeshan Hyder,4393501
,,,,
15251,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. That?s helpful. And then my real question, as you guys kind of think about on the operating landscape over the next few months. I mean, just today, I guess, stay-at-home orders went back, in fact, in Los Angeles and some other jurisdictions in California. So how are you guys thinking about the impact on consumer demand? Thanks.",Vivien Azer,4393501
,,,,
15252,Question-and-Answer,"Sure. Tim, why don?t you take that? This is Tom.",Tom Lynch,4393501
,,,,
15253,Question-and-Answer,"Absolutely. So I don?t think there?s any getting around the fact that reducing storage capacity in California from 50% to 20% will have some impact on our in-store sales. But I think the positive thing to take out of this is that, because we?ve built a foundation, where we think we have an unbelievably good delivery operation, especially now with the addition of scheduled delivery and with the success that we?ve seen from curbside pickup that we think we?ll be able to weather through this income out in pretty good shape. But there will be -- there will absolutely be a store impacted from capacity in the stores. But again, I think, we?re really well-positioned with delivery and curbside pickup.",Tim Bossidy,4393501
,,,,
15254,Question-and-Answer,Understand. Thanks very much.,Vivien Azer,4393501
,,,,
15255,Question-and-Answer,Your next question comes from a line of Scott Fortune from ROTH Capital Partners. Your line is open.,Operator,4393501
,,,,
15256,Question-and-Answer,"Good afternoon and thanks for taking the question. Tim, with your cash flow positions and you want to grow for next year 2021? Where are you prioritizing resources and capital allocations in 2021? You have two stores in Massachusetts, four in Florida, potentially a second one in Illinois. Kind of just stepped up to the near-term plan and timeline of that allocation -- capital allocation of providing growth going forward here?",Scott Fortune,4393501
,,,,
15257,Question-and-Answer,,Scott Fortune,4393501
,,,,
15258,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. Tim, why don?t you take to those markets again.",Tom Lynch,4393501
,,,,
15259,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. Absolutely. So, as discussed, I think, our highest ROI dollars are going to be allocated to expanding our canopy within Florida, just given how attractive our store footprint is already in that market and how many stores are ready to go. So that?s going to be our top priority in terms of allocation of CapEx dollars and then after that we?ve got minimal CapEx dollars to go again to open up our Emeryville location, which we?re incredibly excited about.",Tim Bossidy,4393501
,,,,
15260,Question-and-Answer,"And then as far as the two San Francisco stores and the two Massachusetts stores, part of that will be timed in parallel with the regulatory pieces of getting those up and running. But those are also incredibly high ROI opportunities on our list. But they?ll come right after allocating dollars to the Florida canopy expansion.",Tim Bossidy,4393501
,,,,
15261,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. And then real quick, what?s the follow up on kind of the asset sales, the one in Illinois. You took opportunities there, Arizona and the other states that you?re looking at? And with the favorable M&A market that?s starting to occur here with the new legal rate rest of states coming on board and additional thoughts on your assets and positioning for potential sales there?",Scott Fortune,4393501
,,,,
15262,Question-and-Answer,"Go ahead, Tim.",Tom Lynch,4393501
,,,,
15263,Question-and-Answer,"So, I mean, I think, we?ll -- the way that we look at our portfolio right now is that we?re going to continue to focus on what we view is our highest value markets where our brand resonates the absolute most for further expansion and we will continue to be disciplined about what our other opportunities are out there from a cash standpoint and from delevering in the balance sheet standpoint. But for at -- where we sit right now, we think we?re really well-positioned with our current portfolio.",Tim Bossidy,4393501
,,,,
15264,Question-and-Answer,Okay. Thanks for the color. I?ll pass it on.,Scott Fortune,4393501
,,,,
15265,Question-and-Answer,[Operator Instructions] And there are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to our presenters for some closing remarks.,Operator,4393501
,,,,
15266,Question-and-Answer,"Well, I appreciate everyone taking the time to join us today. We?re pleased with the progress that we?re making. I am very pleased despite the headwinds -- the macro headwinds that we?re all facing. We just hope that everyone stay safe and healthy. And we look forward to speaking with you all again and thanks for taking the time. Take care.",Tom Lynch,4393501

15267,Question-and-Answer,"Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today?s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",Operator,4393501

15268,Presentation,"Go ahead, Mr. Putnam.",Operator,4393467
,,,,
15269,Presentation,"Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome, everybody, to HealthEquity's Third quarter of Fiscal Year 2021 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Richard Putnam, Investor Relations for HealthEquity.",Richard Putnam,4393467
,,,,
15270,Presentation,"Joining me today is Jon Kessler, President and CEO; Dr. Steve Neeleman, Vice Chair and Founder of the company; Darcy Mott, the company's EVP and CFO; Tyson Murdock, our EVP and Deputy CFO; and Ted Bloomberg, our EVP and Chief Operating Officer.",Richard Putnam,4393467
,,,,
15271,Presentation,"Before I turn the call over to Jon, I have two important reminders. First, press release announcing our third quarter earnings, including definitions of certain non-GAAP financial measures that we'll reference today was issued after the market closed this afternoon.",Richard Putnam,4393467
,,,,
15272,Presentation,"Copy of today's press release, including reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures with comparable GAAP measures and a recording of this webcast can be found on our Investor Relations website, which is ir.healthequity.com.",Richard Putnam,4393467
,,,,
15273,Presentation,"Second, our comments and responses to your questions today reflects management's view as of today, December 7th, 2020, and will contain forward-looking statements as defined by the SEC, including predictions, expectations, estimates, or other information that might be considered forward-looking. There are many important factors relating to our business, which could affect the forward-looking statements made today.",Richard Putnam,4393467
,,,,
15274,Presentation,"These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause the actual results to differ materially from statements made here today. As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements and we also encourage you to review the discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock detailed in our latest annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent periodic reports filed with the SEC.",Richard Putnam,4393467
,,,,
15275,Presentation,"We assume no obligation to revise or update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. And at conclusion of our prepared remarks, we'll turn the call over to Jimmy, our operator, to provide instructions and to host our Q&A.",Richard Putnam,4393467
,,,,
15276,Presentation,"With that, I'll now turn the mic over to our CEO, Jon Kessler.",Richard Putnam,4393467
,,,,
15277,Presentation,"Thanks, Richard, and hi everyone. I've got a whole script here, but I'll just start by saying COVID is a tough backdrop, but the team is really firing on all cylinders right now to deliver the profitable and growing and visible business that you all expect from us.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15278,Presentation,"During the fiscal third quarter, team Purple delivered sequentially improved financial results and exceeded our expectations given the difficult backdrop of the pandemic, more progress on integration and strong sales driven by our total solution strategy. We are raising our full year outlook and feel confident enough to offer a very early look at key drivers for fiscal 2022.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15279,Presentation,"I'm going to discuss Q3 performance, including key metrics, our perspective on FY 2021 sales heading into January, and WageWorks integration. Steve's going to offer a perspective on what the outgoing and incoming administrations in Congress can do to support health care consumers. Tyson is going to detail financial results, and then Darcy will cover revised guidance. We've got Ted here with us for Q&A. So, we've got a full basketball team -- the full starting team plus I'm kind of like sixth man, as you might expect.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15280,Presentation,,Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15281,Presentation,"Let's start always - as we always do with key metrics. Revenue of $179 million is up 14% year-over-year, reflecting organic growth and the lapping of WageWorks in August, which was tempered by the pandemic's continued impact on custodial yields and our member's use of commuter benefits and health care cards during the pandemic.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15282,Presentation,"We estimate that lower commuter benefits utilization and healthcare card spend on their own, excluding interest rates, created about $10 million of headwind during the quarter.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15283,Presentation,"Adjusted EBITDA of $61 million is up 10% year-over-year, and adjusted EBITDA margin of 34% was steady sequentially, despite the beginning of the enrollment season ramp. As I will discuss in a moment, we believe there is more to come over time.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15284,Presentation,"5.5 million HSAs at quarter end are plus 9% year-over-year, plus 11% organically, that is excluding the impact of migration-related closures that we talked about last quarter, 104,000 newly opened HSAs is, we believe, a solid figure, given the dearth of newly hired benefits eligibles throughout the economy during the quarter.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15285,Presentation,"12.5 million total accounts were flat year-over-year with growth in HSA, FSA and COBRA, offsetting the decline of about $0.6 million in commuter accounts that are currently in suspense.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15286,Presentation,"Last, but definitely not least, HSA assets reached $12.4 billion, up 19% year-over-year and up $229 million sequentially. While investment asset values provided some tailwind, continued contribution from members in response to HealthEquity's engagement and education efforts, we believe, really is what drove this growth.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15287,Presentation,"As you know, Q4 and particularly January will truly reveal the results of sales activity in FY 2021. And I want to minimize the growth challenges that we face, as many HR departments have pushed off initiatives, some really do remain in crisis mode, and of course, work from home drags on for nearly all of us.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15288,Presentation,"That having been - and additionally new hiring by our clients, which normally provides a base of new account growth, is slow. All that having been said, the team is excitedly preparing for what we believe will be our busiest January ever. And here are a few of the reasons why we are excited.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15289,Presentation,"First, relationship executives managing HealthEquity's 500 largest employer clients, achieved a 97% retention rate in FY 2021 and that's despite all of our platform migration activity, because platform migration has proven to be less a source of attrition and more an opportunity to demonstrate to clients what remarkable purpose mean -- I'm sorry, what remarkable service means and Purple in action.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15290,Presentation,"The enterprise sales team appears to have delivered its best performance in several years, driven by impressive win rates in cross-selling to existing clients, but helped along too by some strong new logo wins. In fact, Thanksgiving week was the first since the summer that the enterprise team didn't have a win. That's pretty late, so that's good.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15291,Presentation,"We've talked previously about the growth in bundled RFPs from our total solution strategy. It's translated into steady growth in the average number of HealthEquity services used by managed clients over the course of FY 2021. And that same trend in the third quarter began appearing in our midsized commercial clients. And with 12 of our network partners having added HealthEquity services to what is already on their shelf so far this year, we hope to extend the trend to our smaller employers in FY 2022.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15292,Presentation,"And finally, open enrollment interactions with members and importantly, prospective members have already more than doubled year-over-year, as clients have embraced the 100% virtual open enrollment tool set that Ted mentioned last quarter. And this includes live and on-demand content, interactive tools, social media and, of course, 24/7 live support for our members and prospective members during open enrollment.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15293,Presentation,,Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15294,Presentation,"The team continues to close and implement FY 2021 business and the enterprise and new partner sales pipeline for FY 2022 is already starting to take shape, with some nice wins for employers with benefit years beginning in March and April already signed. So that's key metrics and sales. Let's talk about integration.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15295,Presentation,"Progress on integration also continues. As of the end of the third quarter, HealthEquity had achieved approximately $55 million of ongoing annual synergies against $63 million of cumulative onetime integration expense, that's a pretty good return. And the team is on-track to achieve a total of $80 million of ongoing annual synergies against cumulative onetime expenses of approximately $100 million by the end of fiscal 2022 as legacy platforms are retired. Indeed, the team reached its FY 2021 goal of 10 platform migrations with more untapped before fiscal year-end. So that indeed really adds to the strength of that.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15296,Presentation,"Off-note, 97% of all HealthEquity HSAs and HSA assets are now on the HealthEquity custodial platform. In Q4, we'll deliver the first installment of HealthEquity's unified portal experience to our clients and then a dozen major new portal features over the next 12 months. With change afoot in Washington, we think most Americans want practical steps to control the pandemic and help families manage its fallout.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15297,Presentation,Steve is here to describe some of the opportunities for HSAs and CDBs and to contribute that Congress is considering. Steve?,Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15298,Presentation,"Thank you, Jon. Last year before the pandemic, approximately 82,000 of our current and potential members attended HealthEquity open enrollment events, including in-person and live online sessions. This year, over 350,000 have attended our live and on-demand events with live support. We think Americans are starting to understand that HSAs and other consumer-directed benefit accounts are part of the solution to healthcare affordability and long-term savings through this pandemic and beyond. And there is evidence that Congress and the incoming administration may come to the same conclusion.",Steve Neeleman,4393467
,,,,
15299,Presentation,"For example, we have been reporting since the pandemic began that consumer spending in healthcare is down year-over-year. Consumers have billions of dollars in FSAs with use or lose provisions. Many have been unable or unwilling to get care during the pandemic. And under current rules and in most cases, they must use their funds by the end of the year to avoid forfeitures. This means consumers and the healthcare system could lose billions of dollars.",Steve Neeleman,4393467
,,,,
15300,Presentation,"As access to care improves, consumers will need that money. The return this week of shelter in place orders in California and elsewhere worsened the problem. Regulators can and in our view, should immediately extend the use or lose period for expiring FSAs through the pandemic emergency period similar to the extension that was passed for paying for telehealth services within high deductible plans during the pandemic.",Steve Neeleman,4393467
,,,,
15301,Presentation,"Extending the use or lose deadline for FSAs would have little or no cost to taxpayers as unused FSA funds revert to sponsoring employers and not the treasury. We believe these rules should apply not only to healthcare FSAs, but for childcare FSAs as well. Because Americans have not been able to go to work and therefore, they should not lose the funds they have set aside for their childcare.",Steve Neeleman,4393467
,,,,
15302,Presentation,Rules around how childcare FSAs can be used during the pandemic emergency period should also be relaxed to allow consumers to have more flexibility to keep working and take care of their kids.,Steve Neeleman,4393467
,,,,
15303,Presentation,"Also incredibly, while we must all use sanitizers, masks and other PPE to prevent the spread of COVID-19, their cost isn't FSA or HSA qualified without a doctor's authorization. Dr. Fauchi's advice apparently isn't enough for the tax man. HR 8450, sponsored by three Republicans and three Democrats would change this. However, this is a common sense measure that shouldn't require an active Congress. We need to help unemployed Americans pay for their healthcare premiums until they're unable to get back to work.",Steve Neeleman,4393467
,,,,
15304,Presentation,,Steve Neeleman,4393467
,,,,
15305,Presentation,"During the global financial crisis in 2008, Congress acted quickly to make COBRA premiums more affordable. We agree with many in Congress, who have signed on to support doing so during the pandemic emergency period.",Steve Neeleman,4393467
,,,,
15306,Presentation,Now turning to HSAs. The Commonwealth Fund and the Employer Benefits Research Institute estimate that 7.7 American workers lost employer-sponsored coverage at the start of the pandemic. Coverage under the ACA exchanges or COBRA cost money.,Steve Neeleman,4393467
,,,,
15307,Presentation,"HSAs are part of the solution to affordability since they can be used to pay these premiums on a pre-tax basis. But, since none of us anticipated this crisis, Congress and our regulators should act to permit catch up contributions to fund these costs by extending the HSA contribution deadline for tax years 2019, 2020 and 2021 until the end of the pandemic emergency period.",Steve Neeleman,4393467
,,,,
15308,Presentation,"Congress can also expand consumers' ability to use HSAs for ACA qualifying insurance premiums by dropping the current requirement that links the stability to eligibility for unemployment insurance, which as we all know, has run out from the Americans.",Steve Neeleman,4393467
,,,,
15309,Presentation,"Finally, there are many consumers who can't make use of HSA because they weren't in a qualified HSA plan pre-pandemic or are unable to choose a qualified HSA plan now. Without a pocket costs continuing to rise and deductibles across all plan types, generally higher than HSA minimum deductibles, any health plan coverage should allow consumers to use an HSA to pay for their out-of-pocket healthcare expenses on a tax-free basis.",Steve Neeleman,4393467
,,,,
15310,Presentation,"Democrats and Republicans have proposed widening HSA eligibility to include more of these plans. We should fix this issue now for the future by permanently allowing individuals with any ACA qualifying coverage, VA or TRICARE, traditional Medicare, Medicare Advantage, Medicaid, Health Care Sharing Ministries or Indian tribal health services to make and/or receive contributions to an HSA.",Steve Neeleman,4393467
,,,,
15311,Presentation,"You can call us nave, but we believe that nearly 50-50 results in November in the house, the Senate and in the presidential election create an environment where moderate voices could have more sway and practical measures have a greater chance for adoption. Our teams in Washington are engaged and working hard to make this happen.",Steve Neeleman,4393467
,,,,
15312,Presentation,I will now like Tyson walk us through the numbers. Tyson?,Steve Neeleman,4393467
,,,,
15313,Presentation,"Thank you, Steve. I will review our third quarter GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. A reconciliation of GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures is found in today's press release.",Tyson Murdock,4393467
,,,,
15314,Presentation,"Our fiscal third quarter financial results, as you know, include the operations of WageWorks, which was acquired in August of last year. So while we have officially lapped the acquisition, keep in mind that Q3 last year had two months of WageWorks in the results, while this year reflects combined results for the full quarter.",Tyson Murdock,4393467
,,,,
15315,Presentation,"Third quarter revenue grew overall in organically in each of our three categories. Service revenue grew to $104.6 million, representing 58% of total revenue in the quarter and 19% year-over-year growth. The increase is primarily attributable to 21% growth in average total accounts, including those from the WageWorks acquisition and new sales.",Tyson Murdock,4393467
,,,,
15316,Presentation,"Custodial revenue grew to $48.5 million in the third quarter, representing 27% of revenue in the quarter and 3% year-over-year growth, despite a 35 basis point decline in the annualized yield on HSA cash with yield assets.",Tyson Murdock,4393467
,,,,
15317,Presentation,"Average HSA cash with yield grew 21% and average HSA investments with yields grew 57% year-over-year. The annualized interest rate yield was 208 basis points on HSA cash with yield. This yield is a blended rate for all HSA cash with yield during the quarter. The HSA assets table of today's press release provides additional details. As previously mentioned, we have migrated 97% of the HSA assets to the HealthEquity custodial platform.",Tyson Murdock,4393467
,,,,
15318,Presentation,,Tyson Murdock,4393467
,,,,
15319,Presentation,"Interchange revenue grew to $26.2 million, representing 15% of total revenue in the quarter and 17% year-over-year growth. The increase is primarily attributable to growth in average total accounts and a negotiated more favorable interchange share, partially offset by reduced spend across our platforms in the quarter.",Tyson Murdock,4393467
,,,,
15320,Presentation,Gross profit reached $104.6 million compared to $96 million in the third quarter of last year. Gross margin was steady sequentially at 58% in the quarter.,Tyson Murdock,4393467

15321,Presentation,"Operating expenses were $93.1 million, or 52% of revenue, including amortization of acquired intangible assets and merger integration expenses, which together represent 15% of revenue.",Tyson Murdock,4393467
,,,,
15322,Presentation,Income from operations was $11.5 million compared to $9.9 million in the prior year. Net income for the third quarter was $1.8 million or $0.02 per share on a GAAP EPS basis compared to a loss of $21.3 million or a loss of $0.30 per share in the prior year.,Tyson Murdock,4393467
,,,,
15323,Presentation,"Our non-GAAP net income was $32.2 million for the quarter compared to $30.3 million a year ago, a 6% increase. Non-GAAP net income per share was $0.41 per share compared to $0.43 per share last year. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter increased 10% to $61.1 million and adjusted EBITDA margin was steady sequentially at 34%, while operating through the impact of COVID.",Tyson Murdock,4393467
,,,,
15324,Presentation,"For the first nine months of fiscal 2021, revenue was $45.4 million, up 65% compared to the first nine months of last year. GAAP net income was $3.5 million or $0.05 per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $93.1 million or $1.25 per diluted share.

15325,Presentation,"On the balance sheet, as of October 31, 2020, we had $299 million of cash and cash equivalents with $1 billion of Term A debt outstanding and no outstanding amounts drawn on our line of credit.",Tyson Murdock,4393467
,,,,
15326,Presentation,I will now pass the mic to Darcy to review our updated guidance. Darcy?,Tyson Murdock,4393467
,,,,
15327,Presentation,"Thank you, Tyson. As you know, our results and guidance for FY 2021 remains sensitive to the COVID-19 pandemic and the timing of economic recovery. As Tyson just discussed, we continue to see improving economic trends, but remain cautious about the impact of a surge in COVID and how quickly employers will open the doors to their businesses, especially in large cities.",Darcy Mott,4393467
,,,,
15328,Presentation,"Based upon our third quarter operating results and the economic progress to-date, we are increasing our guidance for full fiscal year 2021. Specific variables will impact our performance through the remainder of fiscal year 2021, include, but are not limited to, members access to and spending on health care and their use of transit, parking, and other commuter benefits.",Darcy Mott,4393467
,,,,
15329,Presentation,"The modest pace of recovery and employment may negatively impact the number of our average total accounts and conversely perhaps spur uptake in COBRA and other benefit continuation products. Across these and other variables, there exists a wide range of plausible outcomes for the remainder of fiscal 2021.",Darcy Mott,4393467
,,,,
15330,Presentation,"Importantly however, our guidance for fiscal 2021, assumes that current trends across these and other variables continue through the remainder of the year.",Darcy Mott,4393467
,,,,
15331,Presentation,"Under these assumptions, we expect HealthEquity will generate revenue for fiscal 2021 in a range between $725 million and $731 million. We expect our non-GAAP net income to be between $116 million and $121 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted net income per share between a $1.55 and $1.61 per share. We expect HealthEquity's adjusted EBITDA to be between $232 million and $238 million for fiscal 2021.",Darcy Mott,4393467
,,,,
15332,Presentation,Our non-GAAP diluted net income per share estimate is based on an estimated diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 75 million shares for the year.

15333,Presentation,,Darcy Mott,4393467
,,,,
15334,Presentation,"Today's guidance includes the effect of having achieved approximately $55 million in annualized run rate net synergies as of the end of the third quarter, with estimated net synergies of $80 million expected to be achieved by the end of FY 2022.",Darcy Mott,4393467

Before we go to Q&A, I'd like to just take a moment to thank our 3,000-plus team members who are continuing, as I'm sure, as everyone listening on this call to work in living rooms and kitchens and foyers, in my case, in a full corner of the floor behind the Christmas tree/Hanukkah bush. And have been doing so for months and months. And at the same time, as I said at the outset, have made, I think, tremendous progress towards delivering our members -- towards helping our members collect -- connect health and wealth, but I think also towards delivering the kind of business that you as shareholders want to see from us.",Jon Kessler,4393467

15343,Question-and-Answer,"Thanks for taking the question. You spoke about strong cross selling. I was hoping, maybe you could provide a little bit more color there? And then what does the overlap look like between existing wage customers and HealthEquity customers?",Anne Samuel,4393467
,,,,
15344,Question-and-Answer,"Ted, why don't you give a little color on the cross-sell activity and what we're seeing? Only if he?s not on mute though. All right, well if he won't, I will. You can still hear me, though, can't you Anne?",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15345,Question-and-Answer,"Jon, can you hear me?",Ted Bloomberg,4393467
,,,,
15346,Question-and-Answer,I can hear you.,Anne Samuel,4393467
,,,,
15347,Question-and-Answer,Now we can hear you. There you go.,Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15348,Question-and-Answer,"All right. Good. I had a great answer, Anne and no one heard it except my ? where I work which is the corner of my bedroom. But luckily, I got to practice. So yes, let me ? we are really pleased with the quality of conversations that we're having with our existing enterprise clients. And the kind of pace with which they are excited to hear more about buying new services from us. ",Ted Bloomberg,4393467
,,,,
15349,Question-and-Answer,"And I think you heard kind of some high-level remarks from Jon and I'll probably get zapped by Tyson, if I go into too much detail. But basically, what we're seeing is a much higher close rate on sales opportunities that are cross-sold, which isn't a surprise. I think we were surprised a little bit of the magnitude of how successful we can be adding new products to our existing clients. We're seeing quarter-over-quarter, the average number of products used by our enterprise clients march upward.",Ted Bloomberg,4393467
,,,,
15350,Question-and-Answer,"And I think more importantly than anything else, we have kind of done some math on the size of the opportunity when we look at our top 500 and then again, 1,500 clients at the products they don't currently hold today and we feel like the opportunity will persist for quite some time for us to kind of continue to make progress there.",Ted Bloomberg,4393467
,,,,
15351,Question-and-Answer,,Ted Bloomberg,4393467
,,,,
15352,Question-and-Answer,"So I want to -- Tyson, jump in if you want to give a little more specific, but I think the punch line is, we see significant success. We see the numbers, the penetration of our products that?s going up, but we also see a lot of runway and probably years worth of cross-sell opportunity to come. ",Ted Bloomberg,4393467
,,,,
15353,Question-and-Answer,"In terms of overlap, I don't think we would share specific numbers, but I think what we're finding in this little anecdotal is, there were places where our overlap saved us a little -- meaning that, if an enterprise was a client of both legacy HealthEquity and legacy WageWorks, the opportunity to say, is all this going to come under HealthEquity service model and having the answer be yes, probably helped inform that 97% retention rate, which Jon alluded to earlier because people were kind of like, okay, we had some problems with wage service as long as you guys are going to address that we're fine and thus far, we've been able to do so. So I don't think, we reveal the exact overlap statistics, but I think that it's been a good guide for us in terms of consolidating services for our enterprise clients.",Ted Bloomberg,4393467
,,,,
15354,Question-and-Answer,That?s really helpful. Thanks guys.,Anne Samuel ,4393467
,,,,
15355,Question-and-Answer,"Thanks, Anne.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15356,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. And our next question comes from Greg Peters with Raymond James. Your line is now open.,Operator,4393467
,,,,
15357,Question-and-Answer,"Good afternoon, Team Purple.",Greg Peters,4393467
,,,,
15358,Question-and-Answer,Hello.,Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15359,Question-and-Answer,"I guess, I'll be the bearer of market news. Last I checked aftermarket, after hours, your stock was down about 5%. And I know you don't get hung up on daily or hourly movements. But I guess, in that performance, so at least aftermarket, I guess, I'm looking at a couple of things that might be spooking some investors. First of all, the guidance for the full year, if you look at it, not that we have the ? our estimates are the final arbiter of what TheStreet looks like, it does look like the implied fourth quarter guide might be a little bit lighter than where TheStreet is.",Greg Peters,4393467
,,,,
15360,Question-and-Answer,"And then secondly, the HSA balances, I think you said in the press release only added $46 million of new cash in the quarter. That I just -- I'm trying to reconcile that number. I mean, you have 5.5 million accounts, that's, what, $8 account in the quarter, and that's all they can add when they're about ? the maximum number of the dollar contributions are substantially higher. And I don't understand that. And then, I'll have one other area that I don't understand to follow-up with.",Greg Peters,4393467
,,,,
15361,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. Why don't you throw that one out, so we can hit them all at the same time?",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15362,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. Then just the accounts, the actual account numbers, the CDB, obviously, the rate is -- the rate of deceleration sequentially is beginning to moderate, but still we're seeing the CDB account numbers decline sequentially. And I think your previous guidance or suggestion would be that, that would stabilize and grow in the fourth quarter.",Greg Peters,4393467
,,,,
15363,Question-and-Answer,"And then the HSA numbers, you throw in the gross numbers, but if you take out the net with ? it's not as strong. So just ? this is the age-old discussion that we always have every quarter, it seems like about the accounts that you're closing at the same time you're opening new accounts. That's it.",Greg Peters,4393467
,,,,
15364,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. I'll take a couple of those, and then I'm going to throw the guidance question over to Darcy. But let me kind of ? and as you might imagine, I'm not really ? I don't ? I don't try ? I try not to look at after hours, much less talk about it, whether ? in whatever direction it goes.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15365,Question-and-Answer,"But, if I look at, ? I'm going to just take your questions from end to beginning and if I miss something, please tell me. On accounts ? on HSAs, in particular, the net growth in HSAs approached 100,000, and we had 104,000 gross news. So I'm not sure, where you are there, but wasn't quite 100,000, but it was getting up there.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15366,Question-and-Answer,,Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15367,Question-and-Answer,"So, for a third quarter, that's not shabby. And as I said in my prepared remarks, one of the issues that is challenging for us in this environment is that normally there's a sort of base of accounts that we'll see in any given quarter that's happening because our ? basically, because employment grows, our clients are hiring new people.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15368,Question-and-Answer,"And obviously, there was ? if you think about the timing of hiring and then the person becomes benefits eligible a month or two later. This quarter did not represent a period where there was a lot of hiring going on. There may have been some rehiring, that?s good. But you know that, and I know it. So, you can judge whether you think that number is good or bad, but it's ? there isn't a huge difference between the open and net increase numbers.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15369,Question-and-Answer,"In addition, on CDBs, the primary issue that we're battling there is commuter. So we had about 100,000 more commuter accounts in suspense this quarter than last. And that was roughly made-up by the increase in HSA and some more modest increases elsewhere. So, that's where we are.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15370,Question-and-Answer,"With regard to the asset side of things, the answer is that people took $170 million and turned it into investment and investment -- market growth during the quarter actually wasn't that helpful, given the timing of beginning and end. And Tyson will go through the math, if anyone would really like. But the big reason is because they deposited cash and they turn it into investments to the tune of $170-odd million, so that seems kind of, okay, that's what we want people to do over the long-term, that's how you grow your balances, and that's how they become sticky account holders.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15371,Question-and-Answer,"So, by and large -- again, it's -- as I commented at the beginning, COVID is not a great backdrop for us. But our job is to control the things we can control and what we can control is building a more profitable and growing business. So, that as those headwinds turn to tailwinds, that we can do more.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15372,Question-and-Answer,"As far as guidance and the implications for Q4, I'm going to throw that one to Darcy and have him get a start on it. And if I want to add something I will. He might be on mute though. Everyone's on mute now.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15373,Question-and-Answer,Can you hear me?,Darcy Mott,4393467
,,,,
15374,Question-and-Answer,"All right. Now, we can hear you.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15375,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah, I tapped the mute button, but it didn't take or the un-mute button. So, the midpoint of our guidance, Greg, would imply like $183 million. We think there's possibly some upside in there, but we're also cautious. It's up from what we just did in this quarter.",Darcy Mott,4393467
,,,,
15376,Question-and-Answer,"We'll see how the spend comes back. That's a variable for us and how much -- Steve talked about getting relief on people being able to spend their FSA dollars and so we're cautiously optimistic about that, but that's kind of where the midpoint of our guidance comes from that we gave.",Darcy Mott,4393467
,,,,
15377,Question-and-Answer,"I mean I would just add, Greg, we had this same exact discussion. I don't think it was you that asked the question, but last quarter, where people were kind of doing the math and dividing by the rest of the year and so forth. And they were like, you're going to have -- and I understand why people do that. But given our approach to guidance and given some of the uncertainties, you can imagine why we're going to want to be conservative. That's how we -- that's how we roll. That's how we've always rolled.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15378,Question-and-Answer,"And so -- but then we try to over deliver. And certainly, I think for the quarter, relative, broadly speaking to analyst expectations, we were able to do so, and certainly, in certain areas relative to our own expectation to be able to do so.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15379,Question-and-Answer,"Got it. Well, I realize I maxed out my one question and then a follow-up, but I sincerely appreciate your answers and thanks for the guidance on custodial revenue.",Greg Peters,4393467
,,,,
15380,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, sir.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15381,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert C. Jones with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.,Operator,4393467
,,,,
15382,Question-and-Answer,,Operator,4393467
,,,,
15383,Question-and-Answer,"Great. Thanks for the questions. Hey, how are you, Jon?",Robert Jones,4393467
,,,,
15384,Question-and-Answer,All right.,Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15385,Question-and-Answer,"I guess maybe just to follow-up there on the guidance. I know you just touched on the revenue side, but I think similar question on the implied EBITDA guide for 4Q looks to be down a bit compared to what you've been doing. It might be a similar answer, but just curious if there's anything worth calling out there as far as what might be driving the sequential EBITDA or at least the expectation for sequential EBITDA to maybe be a little bit lower than some were expecting.",Robert Jones,4393467
,,,,
15386,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. Darcy, do you want to get this one?",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15387,Question-and-Answer,"Sure. I mean, historically, we've always -- and you go back and look at our history, even premerger and post merger, Q4 has a lot of expenditures getting ready for our January enrollment that will come in. And so, we've been hiring people. We've been training them. We've been getting them on the phones.",Darcy Mott,4393467
,,,,
15388,Question-and-Answer,"And those expenses will hit in -- both in service delivery and in some of our operating expenses in Q4. And so, what we're most pleased about, actually, is that as we've gone through this transition and migration that we've done, what we feel is, a pretty good job of maintaining EBITDA margin with the efficiencies and the benefits that we've got from synergies, despite, you could argue $20 million of revenue impact per quarter from COVID.",Darcy Mott,4393467
,,,,
15389,Question-and-Answer,"And so -- and to be able to get margin out of that and still get through all of these shortfalls in the revenue that we've had with respect to the commuter business we've talked about in the spend in interchange, that's what's factored into all of that, and it flows down to the EBITDA line also, notwithstanding the fact that we're striving to get more efficient and to maintain margin as best we can.",Darcy Mott,4393467
,,,,
15390,Question-and-Answer,"No, that's super helpful. And then, maybe, if I can just ask one follow-up. I was kind of curious on some of Steve's comments around the potential for extending the use it or lose it clause with the FSAs, not being as familiar with it. Just was wondering if maybe you could share a little bit more of what actually does need to happen for that to come to fruition?",Robert Jones,4393467
,,,,
15391,Question-and-Answer,"Does it need an active Congress? Is it up to employers? And then probably, most importantly, like what would that mean to the model for HealthEquity if we find ourselves somehow going into next year with larger FSA balances than we would have otherwise expected to see?",Robert Jones,4393467
,,,,
15392,Question-and-Answer,"Well, I'll take that one and then ask if Steve wants to comment further. As you may recall, the regulators felt they had the authority to extend some other deadlines as they approached earlier in the year, an example being the deadline that people had to enroll in COBRA, which has been extended to the end of the quarantine period. I'm sorry, the end of the pandemic emergency period.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15393,Question-and-Answer,"But now, I'm thinking most people at the time did not think we would still be here at this point in the year, and yet we are. So from our perspective, this is something that the regulators can do. It's certainly something that's being talked about actively, whether they can get their act together or it requires an active congress to get their act together, that's, to some extent, above our pay grade.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15394,Question-and-Answer,"But I think similar to some of those other actions, the practical effect is really is -- I think the reason to do it from a public policy perspective is, it leaves billions of dollars in the healthcare system that will otherwise come out of the system and leave those in consumers' hands that will otherwise come out of them. So that's good for us. Of course, it's good for us in the sense that people have more money to spend and so forth.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15395,Question-and-Answer,"But we just think it's -- and we're working our butts off to make sure people know this and that they don't assume that's going to occur. And instead, spend the dollars where they can. But as you know, and particularly with the new shutdowns, there are people who are -- just don't have access to spending those dollars usefully.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15396,Question-and-Answer,,Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15397,Question-and-Answer,"And so, this seems like a very common sense thing to do. We're hopeful that it does get done, because it's the right thing to do. And would there be some benefits in terms of people having more money in those accounts to spend as they can get back outside, whatnot? Of course, there would be.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15398,Question-and-Answer,That makes a ton of sense.,Robert Jones,4393467
,,,,
15399,Question-and-Answer,"Robert, the only thing I'd add, Jon's got it right. I mean, he knows this is cold. But when they issued this notice 2020 ? that?s in the spring, they just kind of said in the language, we think -- everything will be back to normal in the fall. So we're going to give -- we're going to extend the deadline for the 2019 plan years because we had the same issue in the spring, right? ",Steve Neeleman,4393467
,,,,
15400,Question-and-Answer,"They didn't have time to use their grace period and we said, we'll extend to 2019 through the end of the year, but otherwise we're going to go back to normal. Because we think it will be back at normal then. We're not back at normal. And so they -- we do think that the regulators can act on this and we think they will. I mean, we know that both the outgoing administration and incoming administration are very pro consumer, which is what this is all about, it's helping the consumers on.",Steve Neeleman,4393467
,,,,
15401,Question-and-Answer,"So I think we're a good spot. There's a bunch of momentum. I can tell you, there's all kinds of sponsors that have been signing on letters and things like that and it's a wide group of people, everyone from the American Benefits Council to the AFL-CIO and on the National Education Association and they're all asking for this leniency not only around when you can use your FSA dollars and your HRA dollars and things like that, but also for things like COVID extension. So we're pushing hard.",Steve Neeleman,4393467
,,,,
15402,Question-and-Answer,Yeah. Make sense. Thanks so much.,Robert Jones,4393467
,,,,
15403,Question-and-Answer,Thank you.,Steve Neeleman,4393467
,,,,
15404,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. Our next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.,Operator,4393467
,,,,
15405,Question-and-Answer,"Hey, George.",Steve Neeleman,4393467
,,,,
15406,Question-and-Answer,"Good evening, team -- hey, good evening guys. No, things are not back to normal yet, Steve. I kind of have three questions. I'll lump them all out at the same time as well. I guess, my first one is; Darcy, on the rate guidance for calendar 2021 of 170 to 180 basis points. As we think about the calendar year, do we expect that to be a linear kind of progression down towards the low end? Or do we expect that to be kind of a flat line number as we go through the year?",George Hill,4393467
,,,,
15407,Question-and-Answer,"And then Jon and Steve, I guess, two questions for you guys. On the strategic side, one is in the most recent benefit selling season as a result of COVID, do you guys feel like you saw any new trends that are important or worth calling out? And then the other one is, United appears to be stepping up their focus on healthcare finance banking. Did you guys see anything different competitively out of them in this most recent kind of end of the selling season? Thanks.",George Hill,4393467
,,,,
15408,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. I'll take the second half. And then, if you don't mind Steve, I'm going to throw back to you in terms of employer trends. First of all, on the competitive side, yes, I was actually really pleased to see in United's Investor Day, them talk about this since as I recall George, it was the last year or the year before when somebody asked me if -- it was in December as well when someone said well, they didn't mention it or they threw it off. And I said great. They've got our number if they want to sell their business.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15409,Question-and-Answer,So -- to my mind it validates that there's a lot of growth opportunity here given all the irons in the fire for United in the regulated and non-regulated segments of the business. ,Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15410,Question-and-Answer,So ? but I think probably the main way we see that is in M&A activity where they've always been competitive for different assets.,Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15411,Question-and-Answer,"Depends on the asset and so forth, as an example, I think it's been widely reported, although I've never seen a press release on it, but it has occurred that they acquired a platform called Connector Care, that's a little more FSA, HRA-focused. And I think that's to try and match what we've done in broadening the offering.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15412,Question-and-Answer,,Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15413,Question-and-Answer,"So that seems like -- from my perspective, if you're in a market with no competitors, that's not so good. But they're a good competitor. And so that's the main thing we've seen. We haven't really seen any particularly different behavior in the actual like offering of products or pricing or that kind of thing. Steve, you want to touch on the question about -- and I suppose, Ted, if you have anything, touch on the question of employer behavior during the selling season?",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15414,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. I think Ted spoke to a lot of this, but generally, employers are under a lot of duress, and they just want simplicity. And I think that's one of the reasons why the bundled product has done so well, because it just gives them less meetings, less partners to have to manage. And frankly, we can help them out on pricing when we put all together. And then, I think George also had a question about ? on the finance team. What was your first question? Or you had a question for?",Steve Neeleman,4393467
,,,,
15415,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, Darcy.",George Hill,4393467
,,,,
15416,Question-and-Answer,"Go ahead, Darcy.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15417,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. So George, you asked about the linearity of the yield. We always start off the year based on the placements that we do in December and January. And usually, we're pretty good on that, about it being linear until we get to the end of the year. In this case, that is generally true. It will start a little bit higher in the first part of the year.",Darcy Mott,4393467
,,,,
15418,Question-and-Answer,"The delta that will occur this year that maybe you won't see as much as in prior years, is in August, when we started -- when we did the acquisition, and we're starting to build capacity for Wage, then we had some contracts that will get reset kind of more in the late in the Q3 and Q4 earlier than they normally would.",Darcy Mott,4393467
,,,,
15419,Question-and-Answer,"So, there maybe a little bit of a decrement that will happen kind of in the second half of the year. And then, we always have a resetting in the December, January and the fourth quarter. So, it's probably a little less linear than we would normally expect, but kind of going chunks quarter-by-quarter throughout the year, if that makes any sense.",Darcy Mott,4393467
,,,,
15420,Question-and-Answer,"That does, and I appreciate the color. Thank you.",George Hill,4393467
,,,,
15421,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. Our next question comes from Sean Dodge with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.,Operator,4393467
,,,,
15422,Question-and-Answer,"Thanks. Good afternoon. So maybe on open enrollment, this is the first year you've approached that 100% virtually. Jon, you mentioned a doubling in the number of interactions that have taken place thus far. Do you have any better sense now how effective those virtual interactions are being or going to be in converting people versus your kind of more traditional in-person approach?",Sean Dodge,4393467
,,,,
15423,Question-and-Answer,"Ted, do you want to start on that one?",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15424,Question-and-Answer,Sure. Is my mute button off? Everyone hear me?,Ted Bloomberg,4393467
,,,,
15425,Question-and-Answer,Yes.,Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15426,Question-and-Answer,"Okay, excellent. I'm luckily I'm not being evaluated on mute button management. We are really bullish about virtual OE for a couple of reasons that I'd like to share. The first one is live OE is often standing around gripping and grinning at a benefits there. And for those of you who've been in a benefits there, you know that doesn't get hit very hard. Oftentimes, people just wander through it. And it is difficult to have a meaningful conversation or room with a bunch of your colleagues.",Ted Bloomberg,4393467
,,,,
15427,Question-and-Answer,"Our model this year is virtual, but with live 24/7 online support. And that adds value in a couple of ways. The first one is, I can tell you for sure that I'm not the benefit decision-maker in my household. That would be Doctor Bloomberg. And when she is now able to watch the webinars and attend, because it's virtual.",Ted Bloomberg,4393467
,,,,
15428,Question-and-Answer,"And then second, if we have a question, we can chat it into the chat box in one of our talented Purple member services, agents can answer it on the spot. And we are really bullish about that model. We've gotten tremendous feedback from employers that their folks are more engaged. We're seeing visits to our various learn sites up significantly. But unfortunately, we won't know exactly how that translates into new accounts until mid to late January. But I think -- if you think about the whole funnel, the top couple of steps in the funnel, we're pretty positive on. Steve, I don't know if you have any other thing -- anything to add on that?",Ted Bloomberg,4393467
,,,,
15429,Question-and-Answer,,Ted Bloomberg,4393467
,,,,
15430,Question-and-Answer,"Well, I mean, we have a little bit of a proxy in our tech sector businesses that were a little more out there for the last couple of years and I would say, generally, Ted, that when we've been able to engage people this way, unfortunately, in previous years, it was more limited because kind of the thing they've been doing for 40 years comes sit in the cafeteria and talk to us, which is totally inefficient. It drives me crazy.",Steve Neeleman,4393467
,,,,
15431,Question-and-Answer,"But for the -- if you think about, Ted, some of our employers, I'm not going to name them for obvious reasons that are more techie and have been doing this for the last couple of years, we do have higher penetration adoption rates within those populations, approaching 50%, 60% in some cases whereas the ones that have had less.",Steve Neeleman,4393467
,,,,
15432,Question-and-Answer,"And so it could be selection bias, right? Yes, they're more techie, they get this stuff faster and all that stuff, but I see -- I hope that what's happened in other sectors is now having more broadband. That's what I would have. But I tend to be an optimist. And that's why sometimes they ran out of gas, as Ted told me earlier today.",Steve Neeleman,4393467
,,,,
15433,Question-and-Answer,"Sure. Okay. So, your point on efficiency, I know you increased your marketing spend a little this year, just to kind of get the momentum up. If this works like you think and we look ahead to next year, how big of a cost saver or kind of efficiency contributor could this be if you do say, maybe not 100% virtual, but something closer than you had done in the past?",Sean Dodge,4393467
,,,,
15434,Question-and-Answer,"Sure, I can take that. I think a couple of different answers. The first one is, it's a moderate savings. I mean it's probably a seven-digit number, but not a massive seven-digit number. But we're trying to reinvest that back into the quality of the experience and the interaction and working really hard to show the types of results that Steve just alluded to with some of our early adopters to other clients so that we get more partnerships through more access and that's been working pretty well.",Ted Bloomberg,4393467
,,,,
15435,Question-and-Answer,"One example is to be able to communicate thoughtfully with both existing account holders at an employer and also prospective account holders at an employer. And we've been able to demonstrate the effectiveness of that. So, we've been able to partner with our employers to drive that further.",Ted Bloomberg,4393467
,,,,
15436,Question-and-Answer,"And so we think that there is -- there are some modest cost efficiencies that we're excited to take, but what we're mostly trying to do is reinvest those into a better experience so people can engage more fully.",Ted Bloomberg,4393467
,,,,
15437,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, I mean, I think that last point is really important. At the end of the day, the purpose of pushing towards virtual education is not to save money here, it's to grow the business and that's really what we're aiming at here.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15438,Question-and-Answer,Got it. Okay. Understood. Thanks again.,Sean Dodge,4393467
,,,,
15439,Question-and-Answer,Thank you.,Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15440,Question-and-Answer,Our next question comes from Sandy Draper with Truist Securities. Your line is now open.,Operator,4393467
,,,,
15441,Question-and-Answer,Mr. Draper?,Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15442,Question-and-Answer,"Thanks very much. And just maybe the first one, I heard two different numbers. I heard Darcy mentioned maybe about $20 million of revenue impact from COVID; you could look at it that way. But I thought I heard Jon say something about $10 million this quarter, if I remember correctly, I think it was $16 million last quarter. I'm just trying to, one; sort of make sure I think about--",Sandy Draper,4393467
,,,,
15443,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, the $10 million is ex-interest rate impact, the $20 million is inclusive of interest rate impact. That's all.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15444,Question-and-Answer,"Okay, okay. Got it. That helps. And then -- and that $10 million, is that comparable with the $16 million last quarter? So we should think about there actually was a little bit of a sequential improvement, but the guidance may reflect with spiking that there may be -- we may see some reversal of that?",Sandy Draper,4393467
,,,,
15445,Question-and-Answer,,Sandy Draper,4393467
,,,,
15446,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, I want to make sure we answer that correctly. So Darcy, do you want to take that one?",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15447,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, that's correct. The $10 million and the $16 million are similar numbers, Sandy? That's correct.",Darcy Mott,4393467
,,,,
15448,Question-and-Answer,Okay. Great.,Sandy Draper,4393467
,,,,
15449,Question-and-Answer,"It's difficult. We want to be -- when we're talking about this impact, we do want to be careful about it. We're trying to give you as accurate as we can a sense of where the business would be in a more normal environment.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15450,Question-and-Answer,"And that's why we've kind of provided the detail of impact with regard to commuter and most of that either number, most of that number is commuter and spend. Spend came back a little bit, obviously, but frankly, not as far back as we would like it to. We got some benefits in other areas. Commuter, obviously, has not -- sort of, is where it is.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15451,Question-and-Answer,"Got it. That's helpful. And then my follow-up is, I can't remember what -- if you've given guidance on when you think the integration expenses sort of wind down. Obviously, it's working. The model is working. You're converting on the technology platforms, the customer like it. So, it's clearly money well spent, but just trying to think about in terms of longer-term cash flow, when that number winds down?",Sandy Draper,4393467
,,,,
15452,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, it?s a very important question. I can take this one. We have committed, I think you'll recall, Sandy, from the -- actually, at the beginning, I think we said that we would have these expenses running through fiscal 2023, but with the acceleration of synergies, it's also true that we are confident that this sort of carve-out for integration expense is going to end in fiscal 2022. And the fiscal 2022 number in terms of aggregate, you can sort of do the math to get up to $100 million will be substantially lower than the fiscal 2021.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15453,Question-and-Answer,"I mean, we are starting to wind this down. And the primary expenses in fiscal 2022 are really around the actual kind of shutting down of platforms and the remaining migrations and that kind of thing whereas in -- and then what's going to be left after that or with that, where the timing is a little uncertain, but we're going to operate as though we're going to get it done in 2022 is -- that fiscal 2022 is there's some sort of residual shareholder litigation-related stuff and real estate stuff from the Wage side, that the timing of which is a little bit out of our hands.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15454,Question-and-Answer,"But have been included in the number that we've quoted in terms of cost all along. And if we can get those done in 2022, great, if not, we'll think about how we want to kind of talk about those on the income statement. But there's not going to be a one-time integration adjustment on the income statement after fiscal 2022.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15455,Question-and-Answer,Great. That?s really helpful. Thanks.,Sandy Draper,4393467
,,,,
15456,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, sir.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15457,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. And our next question comes from Stephanie Davis with SVB Leerink. Your line is now open.,Operator,4393467
,,,,
15458,Question-and-Answer,Hi guys. Congrats on the quarter and thank you for taking my questions.,Stephanie Davis,4393467
,,,,
15459,Question-and-Answer,Thank you.,Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15460,Question-and-Answer,"So, Jon, I have a strategic question for you.",Stephanie Davis,4393467
,,,,
15461,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, ma?am.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15462,Question-and-Answer,You guys have done a raise. We've been talking about some assets out in the market. You've talked about competitor buying a platform. Where are you on your M&A priorities? And how narrowly focused are we on the idea of buying books of business as opposed to maybe adjacencies?,Stephanie Davis,4393467
,,,,
15463,Question-and-Answer,"It's a really good question. Thank you for asking. Let me first say that investors should understand that one of the things that has occurred this quarter in practices that we've added more gun powder to the depot or whatever the right metaphor is. You can show how much I know about gun powder. I don't know where you keep gun powder, right? ",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15464,Question-and-Answer,I will accept it.,Stephanie Davis,4393467
,,,,
15465,Question-and-Answer,"I had a gun once, not anymore. I am from Miami, everyone's got a gun, but not anymore. And so we're looking at nearly $300 million of cash on the balance sheet. Obviously, we're adding cash every quarter. And the ratio, the debt ratio is now well under control. And I think importantly, I mean, there aren't that many businesses out there that I'm aware of that take some of these body blows with COVID and are delivering not just profits, but good profits.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15466,Question-and-Answer,,Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15467,Question-and-Answer,"I mean, we didn't -- I know I'm rifting a little bit. But there are a lot of companies out there that some of their profit is like, well, employees ? the health plan is ? has got a surplus and we're taking that into income. We didn't do that. We rebated that to our employees in Q3. And I shouldn't even say employees, our teammates in Q3. ",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15468,Question-and-Answer,"And so bottom line is -- that's all to say that, I think the opportunity we have is substantial. The question that you're asking is how we're thinking about deployment of that ammo or gun powder or whatever.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15469,Question-and-Answer,"And let me say first that, our primary focus remains on competitive assets. We are looking at those very carefully. So for example, the item I referenced in earlier question about an asset that UNH bought. I mean, that's not an asset we needed and an asset that we would have had to look at that in terms of what does it add to the growth opportunity of the business and they were looking at it a little differently in terms of being an alternative to a buy -- to a build. So that's something that we're not going to do. And even with portfolio assets, we have a model and we follow it and when it works, it works. ",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15470,Question-and-Answer,"So I guess, I would say generally, we remain focused on -- for significant deployment we remain focused on competitive assets, particularly those that create real growth channels where there's relationships with third parties that we can see growing the business, where the employer business is relatively young so that there can be growth there, that kind of thing. ",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15471,Question-and-Answer,"We are looking at adjacencies, but we look at adjacencies from the following perspective. One is, in terms of strengthening our core, in the same way that we looked at wage, right? So ultimately, our mission is to help consumers connect health and wealth.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15472,Question-and-Answer,"And as Steve commented, everyone's kind of got a high -- what we used to call a high deductible, everyone's got one of those now. And so really, we look at it in terms of how to serve that population well in any number of different ways. So we're not thinking about like, well there's one leg of the stool and then we need another leg of the stool.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15473,Question-and-Answer,"And then secondly, I would say, with regard to adjacencies while we're comfortable with the idea that there may be some kind of tuck-in items that make a ton of sense. We're not throwing out the build option in those areas because as you know, asset prices are what they are. They're pretty ? so they're well elevated, and they're particularly elevated in some of these private market environments. So, we're not ? we're certainly not shying away from the opportunity to build or partner in some of these areas, too.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15474,Question-and-Answer,"So, I guess that's a long way to say, our primary focus remains competitive assets. It's going to be competitive assets where we think we can really create value for our shareholders with the purchase. And we have a well-developed model to use that. We're going to use it. And then, we are looking at adjacencies, but there are adjacencies that feeds the core. And we're just as happy to build or partner, as we are to buy something in those areas.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15475,Question-and-Answer,"I'm exploring those adjacencies a little bit. I mean, you probably have a better view than we do in these better?",Stephanie Davis,4393467
,,,,
15476,Question-and-Answer,"I knew whatever I said I was going to be asked about exploring. So it's a chocolate pudding, I would still get the same thing.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15477,Question-and-Answer,"Jon, you could?",Stephanie Davis,4393467
,,,,
15478,Question-and-Answer,Go ahead. I am sorry.,Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15479,Question-and-Answer,"?have done things for a while, I'd still be like, all right, cool for the adjacencies. So, a ? but you've been talking the benefit managers, right? I mean you're in your selling season. So,?",Stephanie Davis,4393467
,,,,
15480,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, ma?am.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15481,Question-and-Answer,?what sort of adjacencies are they looking to consolidate under one vendor?,Stephanie Davis,4393467
,,,,
15482,Question-and-Answer,,Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15483,Question-and-Answer,"It's really interesting. We just completed some research on this topic. And I'm not going to tell you all about it because some of the findings are ones that we want to remain proprietary. But, what I will say is that, what's really interesting to me is, and I think hopeful for the business is that, employers is two things.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15484,Question-and-Answer,"One is, the drive ? it's interesting there's a drive, obviously, for simplicity, along the lines that Steve talked about. And in addition to that, employers want ? they don't just want engagements, they want effective engagement.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15485,Question-and-Answer,"And I think that we're beginning to see a little bit of a discernment between like, okay, there's engagement on stuff people expect us as employers to deliver. And then there's engagement on stuff that maybe they go elsewhere for it. And we're not the natural place. And one thing people expect of their employers is the financial side of healthcare, right?",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15486,Question-and-Answer,"They are buying their health insurance from employers. And they expect their employers to provide assistance in helping them navigate the financial side. And so, I see that as a really interesting positive trend. And kind of maybe points the way a little bit to where, we think about the product adjacencies being.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15487,Question-and-Answer,"And importantly, that thought is not limited to their people in HSAs, right? Employers have begun to do the math, and they recognize at this point, that the only distinction between an HSA plan and a comparable PPO plan is plan design. It's not out-of-pocket exposure, maybe a little different, right?",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15488,Question-and-Answer,"But they want to get to the place where people are comfortable, managing their portion of the cost responsibility for care. And they know they're not there yet. And they know that the solutions that are out there are not ? don't fully cut the mustard. And they continue to want to be more in that area.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15489,Question-and-Answer,"Understood. Super helpful. Thank you, Jon.",Stephanie Davis,4393467
,,,,
15490,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, ma'am.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15491,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you, team.",Stephanie Davis,4393467
,,,,
15492,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. Our next question?,Operator,4393467
,,,,
15493,Question-and-Answer,"Well, last year was yellow shots, and this year, it's gone. So who know? It could be trouble.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15494,Question-and-Answer,"I forgot the worst thing, Jon.",Stephanie Davis,4393467
,,,,
15495,Question-and-Answer,That could be troubled.,Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15496,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. Our next question comes from Don Hooker with KeyBanc. Your line is now open.,Operator,4393467
,,,,
15497,Question-and-Answer,"Great, great. Good afternoon.",Don Hooker,4393467
,,,,
15498,Question-and-Answer,"Hey, Jon.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15499,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you for the question. Hey, good afternoon. Good afternoon. Hey, one area that hasn't been touched on, as you guys are ? and it does affect your P&L. I guess, negatively in the near-term, but positive in the long-term, is just to shift to investments. It's hard to discern the trend there. But clearly, it's because I know you're trading off empty accounts and you're cleaning up your HSA account base. But it looks like the percent of HSAs with investments is certainly up very sizably for several quarters in a row now.",Don Hooker,4393467
,,,,
15500,Question-and-Answer,"I'm just trying to think about how you -- is there a way to think about what that trend might look like going forward? Because obviously, in the near-term, it would maybe hurt your P&L a little bit long-term, obviously, it helps you. But near-term, I just want to make sure kind of help us how to think about that?",Don Hooker,4393467
,,,,
15501,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, I mean, I'll answer and then invite Darcy or Tyson to speak further. But you have it exactly right. Invested assets -- I can't remember whether it's assets or account holders with investments grew by 50% year-over-year, one or the other and continue to grow, although there's still a very small percentage of total account holders.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15502,Question-and-Answer,"And per Greg's question from before, we are seeing, and frankly, we want to see our members invest. So, I guess, we don't spend a lot of time thinking about the short-term impact of that to the income statement.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15503,Question-and-Answer,"In fact, I'd say, we spend no time thinking about it. We think about the long-term and the long-term is investors are great customers. And they're great -- and they're doing the right thing by themselves. There are people who, given their risk preferences and so forth, shouldn't be investing, and we have some great product options for them. But for most people, given the long-term nature of this product -- the long-term opportunities with the product, they should be investing. So, that's kind of our overall mindset about it. Darcy or Tyson, you add anything to that?",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15504,Question-and-Answer,,Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15505,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, I'd like to add just one thing and then Tyson can jump in. When we went public, the percentage of HSAs that were investors was 2%, and that was pretty much an industry-wide statistic that was true for not only us, but for everybody out there. And I think that other people may have paid attention to this, but I think that the efforts of HealthEquity have actually grown this so that we are now up over 5%. And you go, well, that's still not that much.",Darcy Mott,4393467
,,,,
15506,Question-and-Answer,"But you know what, every month, I look at that number. When we close the books, I look at that number and it grows every single month. And you're right, the first thing that has to happen is that they did it and they actually become an investor. Once they become an investor, then they start treating their HSA instead of as a spending account and into a savings account and a long-term retirement savings account.",Darcy Mott,4393467
,,,,
15507,Question-and-Answer,"So, it takes a long time, but it's what we've been about and we'll continue to do and the P&L will follow accordingly, and we're in this for the long haul. And people should have more than $3,000 in their HSA. They just should. They should have more than $5,000. And they should have way more than that, because it will pay for their health care expenses for the rest of their life and in retirement, when they'll have significant healthcare expenses.",Darcy Mott,4393467
,,,,
15508,Question-and-Answer,"And you should be able to pay for those tax-free instead of pulling that money out of your K. I mean, I've pontificated on that numerous times. But yes, we're going to stick that course and it will -- the accounts grow and the assets grow much faster than the other cash balances due.",Darcy Mott,4393467
,,,,
15509,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. The only two cents I would add is just when you see someone start to utilize investments, and I was talking to someone this morning about that. They really get what we're trying to do. And so when I think about this, based on my background, I think about this is it is a little bit of an investment, because you don't earn as much revenue from this. So, maybe it's like offering free shipping or Prime. But you know when people do that, that they are sort of -- that then they're, sort of, hooked into this, right? And they get it. And by the time they've gone through the next 25 years of their life, they're going to have a significant amount of dollars in here to fend off the next pandemic or whatever it might be. It's a great savings tool to really create stability for someone in a financial way.",Tyson Murdock,4393467
,,,,
15510,Question-and-Answer,Super. Thank you for the commentary,Don Hooker,4393467
,,,,
15511,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Marcon with Baird. Your line is now open.,Operator,4393467
,,,,
15512,Question-and-Answer,"Hey. Good afternoon, everybody and thanks for taking my questions.",Mark Marcon,4393467
,,,,
15513,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, sir.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15514,Question-and-Answer,"I'm wondering, can you talk a little bit about how you're thinking about calendar 2021? I know what the normal cadence is in terms of giving guidance and fully appreciate the rate commentary. But just, as we're in the middle of the sales season, what are some of the general things that people should think about and consider with regards to how the selling season is going.",Mark Marcon,4393467
,,,,
15515,Question-and-Answer,You mentioned the cross selling is going well. How should we think about like new logos? How should we think about the differences between large enterprises versus some of the small employers that are out there?,Mark Marcon,4393467
,,,,
15516,Question-and-Answer,"And also, just from an asset composition, how should we think about that trend where people are getting it and shifting more and more of the assets to investments as opposed to cash. How would that end up impacting the cash balances as we go through the year?",Mark Marcon,4393467
,,,,
15517,Question-and-Answer,"So there was a lot in there. Darcy, you want to take a shot at this one?",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15518,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. I'll start with the last part and then maybe Tyson can gear up a little bit and talk about what we're thinking. And, Jon, some of the things we've talked about and it?s what we expect with respect to relationships and so on and so forth going into calendar 2021. I know we have a list of some of those things.",Darcy Mott,4393467
,,,,
15519,Question-and-Answer,,Darcy Mott,4393467
,,,,
15520,Question-and-Answer,"And so, with respect to the cash balances, I would note, Mark that notwithstanding the fact that the investment balances have continued to grow. People are moving money from cash. But in spite of that, our cash balances are still growing. And that's just a tribute to the model of what this is all about.",Darcy Mott,4393467
,,,,
15521,Question-and-Answer,"People, even investors, still maintain a cash balance. And they get there by contributing more than they spend and they can grow it to a certain whatever balance they feel like they want to maintain in cash. And then put the rest of it into investments.",Darcy Mott,4393467
,,,,
15522,Question-and-Answer,"And so, we are very encouraged by both items. One, the amount of people that are getting it and moving money into investments and starting to investment -- to invest, but also we still continue to have positive growth in our cash balances. And that comes from contributions.",Darcy Mott,4393467
,,,,
15523,Question-and-Answer,"It comes from them putting a little bit more aside every year, then when they go through open enrollment, generally, they have opportunity to tell their employer how much to take out of their paycheck, starting in January. And we see a big uplift in January and then it moves forward throughout the year.",Darcy Mott,4393467
,,,,
15524,Question-and-Answer,"So that's how we really view this movement. How accurately we can always predict about the movement from cash to investments. We, obviously, grow our investments a little bit faster than the cash, but we still anticipate cash balances will grow.",Darcy Mott,4393467
,,,,
15525,Question-and-Answer,"Hey, Mark, I'm just going to -- since that was a long question, I want to make sure I give you a more direct answer. Is there a second part there that Darcy didn't touch on?",Tyson Murdock,4393467
,,,,
15526,Question-and-Answer,"No, he hit it, and I fully appreciate that the cash is continuing to grow and that we obviously want the investments to grow at a faster rate, because that proves the long-term value. So fully appreciate both parts.",Mark Marcon,4393467
,,,,
15527,Question-and-Answer,"I think that the other question that I was referring to a little bit, and Jon maybe you even want to talk about this longer term. We're not giving FY 2022 guidance, obviously. But there are some things that, we think about going forward. We think that we're going to still grow accounts. We think that we're going to still grow assets, as we talked about. And at some time, we think that some -- this pandemic will be over, we don't know exactly when. But when it does, maybe the vaccine and people start coming back to work and then we see a little bit more, what we would call normality in our business, right?",Darcy Mott,4393467
,,,,
15528,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. I mean look, I guess this is where we -- I think, philosophically Mark, it's funny. I mean, we've had this pandemic, but if you look at what we said we were going to be focused on a year ago and what we are focused on, it's exactly the same thing. And in truth, if you look at what we said, we'd be focused on at the time of the WageWorks acquisition or for that matter, at the time of the IPO. It's exactly the same thing. And that's because we have the same belief in the long-term opportunity in the business.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15529,Question-and-Answer,"And so what we are trying to do is, rather than there are obviously things we could do and that maybe others are, maybe they're not to try and chase around anything. Even -- we could be spending all day and night trying to figure out well, what should we do with our commuter business?",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15530,Question-and-Answer,"Well, the answer is, we should be ready when people are ready to come back to work. And if it turns out that; at the end, 5% less come back to work, okay, fine, then we'll deal with that. But for the moment the answer is, we should be ready when 95% of them are ready to come back to work, right?",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15531,Question-and-Answer,"And similarly with regard to rates, there was a lot of discussion well, you know, is there some change in the model, etcetera, etcetera? The answer is we should be focused on helping people grow their balances and on building strong relationships and diverse relationships with the places we can deploy those deposits, right? And that's what we've been doing.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15532,Question-and-Answer,,Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15533,Question-and-Answer,"And the result of that, I'm kind of actually funny as some of you know, Steve and his brother David have a history in the airline business. And one thing that I've heard from David in the past is that, if you can make money as an airline when oil prices are skyrocketing then you can do really -- if you can breakeven then, you can do real well when they're not. And I always feel that way about our business.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15534,Question-and-Answer,"If we can deliver -- we turned in 34% EBITDA margins last quarter and that was despite really missing effectively, as we talked about an earlier question, $20 million of very high-margin rev. And if we can be a good, strong, profitable business with improving customer metrics and all those kinds of things in an environment like this, then we can be a great business in a better environment.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15535,Question-and-Answer,"And some people will dig that and some people will want to bet on what the next quarter is or isn't going to be like with regard to the pandemic. I -- that's not a bet I know how to make, so I'm not making it.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15536,Question-and-Answer,I appreciate that. Thank you.,Mark Marcon,4393467
,,,,
15537,Question-and-Answer,Thank you.,Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15538,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. And our next question comes from Allen Lutz with Bank of America. Your line is now open.,Operator,4393467
,,,,
15539,Question-and-Answer,"Hey, Allen.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15540,Question-and-Answer,"Hey Jon, thanks for taking the questions. I guess, given the lack of spending year-to-date, does the 4Q guide assume an elevated FSA spend versus normal years or is there a headwind expected from lockdown?",Allen Lutz,4393467
,,,,
15541,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. So we were very -- this is an area we were somewhat cautious, honestly, Allen. We -- and I probably should have just thrown to Tyson, but since I started, I'll just keep going. Especially seeing the shutdown activity that's occurring and whatnot, we just don't know the answer.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15542,Question-and-Answer,"Normally, what we would expect is, as we talked about elsewhere, people got to use their balances. And notwithstanding, the possibility of some relief along the line Steve talked about, one, that message may not get to everybody.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15543,Question-and-Answer,"And two, folks shouldn't be waiting around and hoping it happens. And as I said, we're doing our best there, but we do recognize that as of today, anyway, those of us in the Golden State and perhaps elsewhere, are not making just casual trips to the doctor's office. We're just not. And so, we've been somewhat cautious about that in our guidance. And so -- and I think that's appropriate. So that's kind of my answer.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15544,Question-and-Answer,"Tyson, do you want to elaborate on that at all? Now, I guess ? let me say one other thing, I'm sorry, and then I'll throw it obviously. In January, people's balances will get topped up just because they have contributions. They are employers that contribute at the beginning of the year. And in the case of FSAs and the like, the balances are all available at the end of the year.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15545,Question-and-Answer,"So we are anticipating increased spending in January but nonetheless, we're remaining somewhat cautious relative to typical trends in light of -- and certainly, relative to what's remaining in people's accounts for the current year in light of the current environment and the surge in cases and so forth. Tyson, anything to add to that?",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15546,Question-and-Answer,"I mean you -- that was the last point I was going to add is just January, obviously, when you think about that, there's a large amount of spend that occurs there. And of course, it's because people get topped up and they have use it or lose it. So, I think the way that this works out, people have that muscle memory. They do that, there's used it or lose it, but still given the unprecedented nature of the year, there's always a little bit of caution built in there about how that will play out, and whether it will look like it has historically.",Tyson Murdock,4393467
,,,,
15547,Question-and-Answer,"Thanks, Tyson. And then going back to the $10 million commuter headwind, a couple of questions. What percent of the costs in that business are variable? And then, I know that you're obviously not guiding to it, but just conceptually, what type of incremental margin would that business have if and when it comes back?",Allen Lutz,4393467
,,,,
15548,Question-and-Answer,,Allen Lutz,4393467
,,,,
15549,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. So thank you for asking that. It's actually interesting. So that ? just first of all, if you co the $10 million includes commuter and then some healthcare spend, but the commuter is the biggest component of it. And the answer is surprisingly that, it's a business where there's a material fixed cost component.",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15550,Question-and-Answer,"And relative to our average gross margins, let's say the incremental gross margins in this business are pretty high. And so, it's ? I mean, they're not quite as high as custodial, but quite -- certainly, a majority of those dollars and a good majority flows down on the flip side as they come back, will flow down to the bottom line. Tyson, do you want to elaborate on that at all?",Jon Kessler,4393467
,,,,
15551,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. I just want to make sure, we definitely don't provide those numbers because we don't want to create a segment in that business. And for the fact of the matter is we service it with our teammates across the Board, and we gain efficiency by that. So, that's an important thing.",Tyson Murdock,4393467
,,,,
15552,Question-and-Answer,"So that's why we wouldn't necessarily throw out numbers, particularly to that. But I would say that as that business has declined. And I think we've shared a little bit, the size of that relative to the business from a revenue perspective, it's about 10% or whatever. It has come down significantly, and we've taken costs out as it's come down relative to that decline.",Tyson Murdock,4393467
,,,,
15553,Question-and-Answer,"And as Jon said, I think this is a place where we want to -- the business is still a good business. It still generates cash flow. We want to be in a position for when the market comes back, that there were the ones there ready to take on the business as it comes through.",Tyson Murdock,4393467
,,,,
15554,Question-and-Answer,"And I do think another positive is just that it's not like we haven't been able to sell this as part of the bundle, even though people aren't utilizing it. Companies still need to have this as part of the offering that they give to their employees. So, I think there's been some success in selling this and so there's potentially some upside when people come back, the fact that we actually have more customers who will have commuter because of that.",Tyson Murdock,4393467
,,,,
15555,Question-and-Answer,Great. Thank you both.,Allen Lutz,4393467
,,,,
15556,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions in the queue at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Jon Kessler for any closing remarks.,Operator,4393467

15557,Question-and-Answer,"Thanks everyone. Have safe and happy, but mostly safe holidays.",Jon Kessler,4393467

15560,Presentation,"Good day, and welcome to the DLH Holdings Fiscal 2020 Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode.

15561,Presentation,"I would like now to turn the conference over to Chris Witty, Investor Relations Advisor. Please go ahead.",Operator,4393459
,,,,
15562,Presentation,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. On the call with me today is Zach Parker, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kathryn JohnBull, Chief Financial Officer. The company?s earnings release and PowerPoint presentation are available on our website under the Investor page.",Chris Witty,4393459
,,,,
15563,Presentation,"I would now like to provide a brief Safe Harbor statement, which is also shown on Slide 2 of the presentation.

15564,Presentation,"On today?s call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of our non-GAAP results to our reported GAAP results is included in our earnings release and in the investor presentation on DLH?s website. President and CEO, Zach Parker will speak next followed by CFO, Kathryn JohnBull, after which we will open it up for questions.",Chris Witty,4393459
,,,,
15565,Presentation,"With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Zach. Please go ahead, Zach.",Chris Witty,4393459
,,,,
15566,Presentation,"Thanks, Chris, and good morning to our friends and shareholders. Welcome to our fourth quarter and year-end conference call. The last 12 months have been very active time for the company setting the stage for continued solid operating performance in fiscal 2021.",Zach Parker,4393459
,,,,
15567,Presentation,"First, however, as we all know, 2020 has been a tumultuous year for our nation as well as our DLH employees throughout the world, one which saw major social and civil unrest ignited by a series of high-profile killings in black communities and, of course, the onset of the coronavirus, which has become the worst global pandemic in a century.",Zach Parker,4393459
,,,,
15568,Presentation,"I would like to take a moment to praise our courageous and truly mission-focused employees, who throughout these difficult times, have been committed to the services that we provide to the underserved, our military and our veterans. Throughout the pandemic, we have had over 1,000 essential personnel entering government facilities on a daily basis, braving the challenges ? not braving the various challenges to deliver high-quality and highly productive services to our customers throughout the country.",Zach Parker,4393459
,,,,
15569,Presentation,"And doing so with complete adherence to CDC and DLH guidelines, resulting in an infinitesimal number of COVID cases. And to the several 100 employees assigned to our DLH offices, but adhering to our stay-at-home directive, thank you. You have done a tremendous job of adjusting to the many challenges of the quarantines and telework without skipping a beat. We realize this can be taxing and look forward to the days where your choice become ? can become the driver for our workplace decisions. We are indebted to you all.",Zach Parker,4393459
,,,,
15570,Presentation,"Starting with Slide 3, let me begin by providing a high level overview of our financial performance and some color on the outlook for the coming year. The company posted revenue of $50.7 million for the quarter, as Kathryn will review in a moment, and $209.2 million for the fiscal year in total. This represents an increase of more than 30% year-over-year, reflecting recent acquisitions, new contract awards and solid results across our core programs and services despite the global pandemic.",Zach Parker,4393459
,,,,
15571,Presentation,,Zach Parker,4393459
,,,,
15572,Presentation,"Operating income was $13.5 million for the year and we posted earnings of $0.54 per share, while EBITDA rose to $20.5 million in fiscal 2020 versus $13.9 million last year. We also completed the acquisition of Irving Burton Associates for $32 million on September 30, bringing prudently aligned health IT solutions and strong credentials with the Defense Health Agency and the Medical Research and Development Command to DLH.",Zach Parker,4393459
,,,,
15573,Presentation,"We generated $19.5 million in cash from operations during the year, which we use to pay down $19 million of debt prior to the acquisition of IBA. So while starting FY 2021 with $70 million of indebtedness, you can rest assure that we plan to once again use the same recipe going forward, utilizing free cash flow to delever the company, as Kathryn will go over momentarily.",Zach Parker,4393459
,,,,
15574,Presentation,"As shown on Slide 4, a record backlog of nearly $700 million provides a strong foundation for the long-term health of the company, bolstered by new wins related to COVID-19, a stronger position within the markets we serve and greater opportunities for growth than ever before. Technology innovations to drive program efficiencies contributed to our recompete award of $150 million Office of Head Start System contract during the quarter.",Zach Parker,4393459
,,,,
15575,Presentation,"We have benefited from the recent actions of the VA on our heritage CMOP programs, with determinations leading to cancellation of the small business set aside solicitation, while remaining in contention for our associated medical logistics work. Accordingly, I feel real proud about the company?s performance and our outlook going forward.",Zach Parker,4393459
,,,,
15576,Presentation,"As I mentioned earlier in the year, DLH is well-positioned within our key spending areas, and we believe strongly that the recent election has not changed that. In fact, we address it - I address it as neutral to positive.",Zach Parker,4393459
,,,,
15577,Presentation,"Turning on to Slide 5. We show that we normally state that our key markets and specific programs enjoy widespread support from both sides of the aisle. I would also add one positive note given the election results. We believe that several healthcare-related spending items will be higher priority under the new administration, resulting in greater access to healthcare and new spending opportunities on health-related priorities, not only for the general public, but also for our military and veterans community.",Zach Parker,4393459
,,,,
15578,Presentation,"We expect that the pandemic preparation will also take a larger role going forward and that the Affordable Care Act maybe enhanced and adjusted during the next four years assuming that Congress concurs. The bottom line is that we anticipate that the agencies we serve will likely operate at current or better spending levels over the next several years, again, underscoring both the strength and stability of the markets we served. Of course, we expect that the BCA caps will expire during FY 2021, but the potential of a continuing resolution provides good stability as we enter FY 2021.",Zach Parker,4393459
,,,,
15579,Presentation,"Turning to Slide 6. I want to provide an update on the pandemic and its impact to DLH. As we have said in the past, our portfolio of mission-critical healthcare-related services across key federal agencies provide numerous opportunities to assist the government in addressing the challenges faced due to COVID-19. Though as always, there are some headwinds in the government contracting market when facing outbreaks in the like.",Zach Parker,4393459
,,,,
15580,Presentation,"We remain cautiously optimistic about the continuing opportunities for DLH to be at the forefront of combating this threat and working feverishly alongside our clients towards mitigation. We won new awards this year in that realm during FY 2020 and we will continue to conduct trials for the safety and efficacy of investigational therapeutics, working closely with the agency, their thought leaders regarding policies, and approaches to respond to the pandemic.",Zach Parker,4393459
,,,,
15581,Presentation,,Zach Parker,4393459
,,,,
15582,Presentation,"I am sure our listeners are well aware of the ongoing dynamics regarding COVID-19. With the positive news about vaccines offset by increases in infections worldwide, it is still a very fluid situation involving the partnership of government and industry and DLH remains well poised to continue support in a variety of these programs.",Zach Parker,4393459
,,,,
15583,Presentation,"We have an active pipeline of opportunities across the entire business platform. And overall, such growth areas are far more offsetting than the near-term headwinds created by certain opportunities associated with program delays, travel restrictions and potential cancellations.",Zach Parker,4393459
,,,,
15584,Presentation,"While we can?t eliminate or while we can?t elaborate further just yet, we do expect that additional work and anticipated task orders could increase organic growth rate in FY 2021 to a higher level than this past year. These are very critical times and DLH is playing a vital role in moving the nation forward addressing many near-term health-related priorities.",Zach Parker,4393459
,,,,
15585,Presentation,"Turning to Slide 7, I would like to review our current strategic visions before handing it over to Kathryn. We have come a long way since I came on board 10 years ago and we wanted to celebrate the fact that DLH has completed this transition into a strong, differentiated company with broad unique capabilities spanning across all three of our market areas in the ? on market focus areas and our recent acquisitions, including Danya, S3, and IBA have continued to bolster our strategic direction.",Zach Parker,4393459
,,,,
15586,Presentation,"We are also rapidly developing our market presence in data analytics, artificial intelligence and machine learning and secure systems. The cyber community will also continue to be key as we position our incentive by cloud solution to expand in the digital transformation technologies.",Zach Parker,4393459
,,,,
15587,Presentation,"We are at the next stage of our development and we look forward to organically growing as well as through acquisitions into an even greater technology leading enterprise that can serve the health-related customers throughout the full lifecycle of modernization. It is an exciting time here at DLH, but we won?t be looking to grow just for growth?s sake. Rather, our new capabilities and market pursuits will continue to be strategically aligned and continue to diversify the business base. We will improve the lives of millions of Americans and ultimately increase the returns for our shareholders.",Zach Parker,4393459
,,,,
15588,Presentation,"Of course, we will continue to utilize our operating cash flow to pay down the debt to de-lever the balance sheet and reduce the interest expense, while investing appropriately in business development opportunities and technology enhancements. We are focused on the next decade, during in which we will build upon what we have accomplished thus far further transforming DLH into a leader in healthcare related technology enabled cloud based solutions for key agencies in the federal government. Given our accomplishments in 2020, our investments coming in 2021 during this pandemic and global economic downturn, we are upbeat about the future and the opportunities for tomorrow.",Zach Parker,4393459
,,,,
15589,Presentation,"I would like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Kathryn JohnBull. Kathryn?",Zach Parker,4393459
,,,,
15590,Presentation,"Thank you, Zach and good morning everyone. We are pleased to end the year on a strong note. Turning to Slide 8, we posted revenue for the 3 months ended September 30, 2020 of $50.7 million versus $54.2 million in the prior year?s fourth quarter. This year-over-year revenue variance largely reflects deferrals in monitoring and compliance programs and a reduction of non-labor cost from the changing business conditions due to the ongoing pandemic. We anticipate revenue to grow organically in fiscal 2021 due to our new COVID-19 contracts and task order timing.",Kathryn JohnBull,4393459
,,,,
15591,Presentation,"Turning to Slide 9, income from operations was $2.7 million for the fiscal 2020 fourth quarter versus $3.4 million last year, adjusting for $0.9 million of acquisition expense, current period operating income improved year-over-year, notwithstanding the revenue delays previously mentioned. This reflects improved operating leverage on G&A costs and reduced depreciation and amortization. We reported net income of approximately $1.4 million or $0.10 per diluted share versus $1.6 million or $0.12 a share last year. Adjusted for acquisition expense of $0.9 million, net income would have been $2.3 million and earnings per share would have been $0.15. The company recorded a $0.6 million provision for tax expense in the fourth quarter of both 2020 and 2019. Interest expense declined to $0.8 million in 2020 versus $1.2 million last year due to lower interest rates and lower outstanding debt for most of the period prior to the acquisition of IBA.",Kathryn JohnBull,4393459
,,,,
15592,Presentation,,Kathryn JohnBull,4393459
,,,,
15593,Presentation,"Turning to Slide 10, EBITDA for the 3 months ended September 2020 was $4.4 million and adjusted for acquisition cost was $5.3 million in line with the prior year period. As a percent of sales, acquisition adjusted EBITDA rose to 10.4% this quarter versus 9.8% last year. Reconciliations of GAAP net income to EBITDA and adjusted EDITDA are in our earnings statement and at the back of this presentation.",Kathryn JohnBull,4393459
,,,,
15594,Presentation,"Slide 11 shows the growth of our backlog since fiscal 2018. Our backlog grew over 66% in fiscal 2020 and we are pleased that this not only reflects recent acquisitions, but also speaks well over our base business. Organic backlog growth was fueled by the Head Start recompete, as Zach mentioned earlier, CMOS extensions and other awards. As Zach indicated, we now have a much more diverse and balanced portfolio of programs and services and stronger revenue visibility for the upcoming fiscal periods.",Kathryn JohnBull,4393459
,,,,
15595,Presentation,"Slide 12 gives a snapshot of our debt position at the end of the fiscal year, reflecting the closing of our recent acquisition of IBA. DLH generated $19.5 million in operating cash during fiscal 2020 versus $18 million last year and we reduced our senior debt bank debt by $19 million during the past 12 months. This resulted in a remaining debt balance of $37 million prior to closing the IBA acquisition on September 30. Even with the new debt, our improved operating performance and higher EBITDA means that our leverage ratio as calculated under our credit agreement is approximately 2.8x EBITDA and substantially lower leverage ratio on similar net debt levels than after our last acquisition in June of 2019. As Zach mentioned, we will continue our practice of using operating cash to pay down debt and expect levels ? debt levels of $50 million to $52 million at the end of fiscal 2021. This concludes my discussion of the financial statements.",Kathryn JohnBull,4393459
,,,,
15596,Presentation,"With that, I would now like to turn the call over to our operator for questions.",Kathryn JohnBull,4393459
,,,,
15597,Question-and-Answer,We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joe Gomes with NOBLE Capital. Please go ahead.,Operator,4393459
,,,,
15598,Question-and-Answer,Good morning.,Joe Gomes,4393459
,,,,
15599,Question-and-Answer,"Good morning, Joe. How are you?",Zach Parker,4393459
,,,,
15600,Question-and-Answer,"Doing well here. I hope everyone there is staying safe also. First question, I was wondering if you might be able to quantify for the quarter or may for the full-year, what the impact on the top line was for some of the pass-through revenues and the delays that occurred in the fourth quarter?",Joe Gomes,4393459
,,,,
15601,Question-and-Answer,"Impact ? I am sorry, Joe, impact of which revenues?",Zach Parker,4393459
,,,,
15602,Question-and-Answer,"Of the absence of the pass-through revenues and some of the delays that occurred in the fourth quarter, what was that impact on the top line for the quarter and the full-year?",Joe Gomes,4393459
,,,,
15603,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. Joe, let me just begin by indicating it, as you know, we did address it as it entered into our book of business in Q3, and it has continued, I will say, also into the fourth quarter, has had some impact as well as currently into our current quarter as well. So, Kathryn, can you give some a round for Joe?",Zach Parker,4393459
,,,,
15604,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, exactly that. We are rounding that at $7 million to $8 million, Joe.",Kathryn JohnBull,4393459
,,,,
15605,Question-and-Answer,About $7 million to $8 million?,Joe Gomes,4393459
,,,,
15606,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, $7 million to $8 million.",Kathryn JohnBull,4393459
,,,,
15607,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. That?s very helpful. Hopefully, some of these restrictions are ? we are able to lift some of these restrictions sooner rather than later, so we can get back to a normalized state of business.",Joe Gomes,4393459
,,,,
15608,Question-and-Answer,"Well, we?re all keeping our fingers crossed there, as you well know. It?s ? at present, we do expect that with the activities of the Thanksgiving holiday, we are really forecasting as are the most models that this week and next we will see greater spikes and potentially the same following the end of last year of December. So probably won?t be seeing much regaining of that for Q1 and Q2 and hopefully, we will start to see some rebound after that.",Zach Parker,4393459
,,,,
15609,Question-and-Answer,,Zach Parker,4393459
,,,,
15610,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. And if I was looking, I took a quick look at the K here. And if I look at year-over-year growth, you had really nice growth in VA, really nice growth in the VA logistics part of it. But revenue year-over-year at health and human services was down about 14%. Can you just kind of break that out? And as you guys are looking forward, do you expect the same type of growth rates on the VA type of business? And can we expect or anticipate a rebound in the health and human services side?",Joe Gomes,4393459
,,,,
15611,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, yes, Joe. I think you have accurately described the model that I expect to continue for at least another quarter or two. I think we will continue to see that veterans will be held out of the communal areas in all of the VA hospitals and clinics throughout the country and thus be far more dependent upon the mail order versions of satisfying their prescription needs, potentially even additional spikes as we look at distributions to our veterans once vaccines and expanded therapeutics come online.",Zach Parker,4393459
,,,,
15612,Question-and-Answer,"Similarly, of course, on the public health and life sciences arena, we are continuing to invest and double down towards the potential of expanding our large network of support team to really tackle and build a large sample base for COVID-19 therapeutics. And so we hope to see that part grow. I think it will be relatively flat still in the market around our HHS-related business, just because again the nature of the business and how it seemed to carry the brunt of the restrictions aspect in our book of business.",Zach Parker,4393459
,,,,
15613,Question-and-Answer,Okay.,Joe Gomes,4393459
,,,,
15614,Question-and-Answer,"And to clarify that, that flat is in the human services and solutions.",Kathryn JohnBull,4393459
,,,,
15615,Question-and-Answer,Correct.,Zach Parker,4393459
,,,,
15616,Question-and-Answer,"Right. Great. Okay. And you mentioned it a little bit, Zach, on the call, but we are operating under a continuing resolution at least for a couple of more Ks. Have you seen any negative or hopefully positive impact here in the current quarter of operating under the continuing resolution?",Joe Gomes,4393459
,,,,
15617,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. The CR is really kind of our friend as much as I hate to describe that sort of state of affairs. There is a tremendous risk associated with, of course, closure, tremendous risk of going into the caretaker state that the federal government could do. So we are really excited to see both the President and the two sides of the ? the other two sides of the government support CR.",Zach Parker,4393459
,,,,
15618,Question-and-Answer,"Of course, we have some things that are expiring in December 11 and 12 that we are optimistic, the folks that we are engaged with on the hill give us a great reason to believe that certainly some continuation there and even the potential of some form of stimulus may mitigate some of the risks associated with this quarter and potentially, the first part of FY 2021.",Zach Parker,4393459
,,,,
15619,Question-and-Answer,"So we will stay tuned there. But the CR is our friend from the standpoint of retention of our businesses, the ability to get these kinds of extensions that have been important to not only us, but some of our peers in the company ? in the industry. It has had an effect of slowing down new work. That?s usually one of the first casualties of a CR and a new ? and a lack of a new budget and that is that the acquisition folks in the GovCon are really, really restricted from issuing new types of awards and new types of contracts.",Zach Parker,4393459
,,,,
15620,Question-and-Answer,So we have got one or two of those in our crosshairs and they just continue to slip to the right. But we are benefactors of that as well as we look at some of the extensions in our recompete work as well.,Zach Parker,4393459
,,,,
15621,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. And one more for me and then I will hop back in queue. Accounts receivable, Kathryn, you might be able to talk a little bit to that. I know that?s something we have been working on in reducing that and it looks like it went up sequentially from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, so just trying to get a little more insight into the accounts receivable situation?",Joe Gomes,4393459
,,,,
15622,Question-and-Answer,,Joe Gomes,4393459
,,,,
15623,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. So some of that - so there was, as you pointed out, some sequential growth attributable to translate to two factors. One is, of course, the acquisition. So our fourth quarter number includes the effect of the accounts receivable we acquired of about $3.5 million.",Kathryn JohnBull,4393459
,,,,
15624,Question-and-Answer,"Additionally, we had a switch in the dispersing office when we ? as a part of the Head Start recompete. And so just getting that process transitioned caused a little bit of ability in accounts receivable. But all of that in proper context, we still have a day sales outstanding less than 60, but it is an opportunity as you imply that for us to derive some additional operating cash flow. And so we know where that will go when it happens.",Kathryn JohnBull,4393459
,,,,
15625,Question-and-Answer,"Great. Thanks for the insight. Great year and look forward to hopefully a better current year, and I will get back in line.",Joe Gomes,4393459

,,,,
15631,Question-and-Answer,"Sure. We are very excited you must be my straight man today, Joe, because we are tremendously excited ? we are tremendously excited about the additions ? the new additions to the DLH family in the form of the IBA team. Mary has proven to be a really good leader and has been integral to our transition efforts across the company. We haven?t said it publicly.

So, we are real excited about it and we think it?s come along well.",Zach Parker,4393459
,,,,
15635,Question-and-Answer,"Great news. And one more on the Infinibyte Cloud, I mean, if you could just talk a little bit about more as where you see that that product going? Are we making sales today on that or is it still like kind of more of a trial type phase?",Joe Gomes,4393459
,,,,
15636,Question-and-Answer,Yes.,Zach Parker,4393459
,,,,
15637,Question-and-Answer,"I mean, it sounds like there is huge potential here. Just trying to get more of an idea of when we might start seeing that potential realized?",Joe Gomes,4393459
,,,,
15638,Question-and-Answer,"Be careful, Joe, people are going to start thinking that I put you up to these questions here pretty soon versus this is really an exciting one. As you know, we are really clear that now is the time to invest and dub [ph] down on our nation?s commitment to secure environments, secure, large scale data analytics platforms. And Infinibyte Cloud is our entry there. As you know, we secured appropriate approvals as FedRAMP marketplace provider earlier this year.

,,,,
15639,Question-and-Answer,,Zach Parker,4393459
,,,,
15640,Question-and-Answer,"To answer the second part of your question, yes, we have actually been providing it for some customers already we are in the process of starting to implement it for another client. We have received requests for some other firms that do not have the capability that also have a commitment to support our target agencies, including the VA and HHS. So we are excited about the potential. There are also a number of major or few major ID/IQs for government wide agencies coming up in the next 3 to 6 months.",Zach Parker,4393459
,,,,
15641,Question-and-Answer,"And they will be drivers for health IT, secure health IT solutions in the cyber realm for 10 years, for the next 10 years. And it?s critical that we have a seat at that table and incentivize is our tool to get there. We are investing today in developing solutions and approaches to increase our win probability there and we will continue those investments over the coming months.",Zach Parker,4393459
,,,,
15642,Question-and-Answer,"So, we think that while there is a, there is some certainly some near-term opportunities and substantial investments going on right now that the cyber community and the secure data analytics in the health arena are going to be huge over the next 24 months and we want to be substantial players there. So we are excited about where it?s going. We have a great team under Jeff Shea and Alan and Alan [indiscernible] and again they have been really, really helping us to feel the super tool to be an enterprise wide capability. We also think IBA has areas bring ? some areas with some customer sets that are looking for that type of secure platform.

15709,Presentation,"This concludes our prepared remarks. And we are now happy to take your questions. Operator, please open the call.",Charlie Cao,4393388
,,,,
15710,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you very much. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] First we have Philip Shen from Roth Capital Partners. The floor is yours, Mr. Philip?",Operator,4393388
,,,,
15711,Question-and-Answer,"Hi, everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one is on the margin outlook for Q4. I think for Q3, your cost per watt was roughly $0.203. And if we take your guidance into account for Q4, it's just the cost per watt, maybe closer to $0.20.7, $0.21. Can you help explain how can your cost per watt be flat in Q4 when polysilicon prices have gone up so much along with glass? I think glass alone is up $0.02 per watt? And then freight is up meaningfully. So where are you? How are you able to maintain that flat cost structure in spite of the rising input costs? Thanks.",Philip Shen,4393388
,,,,
15712,Question-and-Answer,"Hey, Philip, this is Charlie. And, you know, the gross margin, 13% to 15% for the fourth quarter. And we are - firstly I want to just to sum up clarification as we believe, it's ? gross margin is reaching to the lowest level. I mean, Q4 is lowest level. And if we look forward, so we expect the gross margin in the first half year, next year, we will gradually improve quarter-over-quarter.",Charlie Cao,4393388
,,,,
15713,Question-and-Answer,"And back to glass. And it's you know, combination, in-house production cost quarter-over-quarter, that's fourth quarter versus third quarter, it did increase because of the polysilicon cost. You know, the glasses and a lot of materials is on the outside trend. On the other side, we - the ASP, the module price, at the same time increased a little bit. And as well as we have, I think we have good mix in terms of the shipments in US and versus you know, some relatively high ASP ratings, higher margin ratings. So which helps us to deliver a relatively, a slightly, let's say the margin, you know, decrease in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter.",Charlie Cao,4393388
,,,,
15714,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. Great. So, were you saying is the pricing is helping to offset, but from a cost standpoint, when you say the in-house production cost is helping, can you specifically highlight what area is helping you drive that cost structure lower and did you specifically find you know, for example, independent the ASP, are you able to - were you able to keep costs flat? And if so, where you're getting that specifically?",Philip Shen,4393388
,,,,
15715,Question-and-Answer,"Philip, and I?d say, the in-house production cost is increased a little bit quarter-over-quarter. And - but the material cost is up dramatically, particularly for the silicon, the glasses. But we are hoping which is offset is by you know, and our production efficiencies and we have relatively more production volume and, you know, the production, the cost is relatively lower, but the material cost is higher.",Charlie Cao,4393388
,,,,
15716,Question-and-Answer,"Second one is the most important is ASP is relatively higher quarter-over-quarter. And with you know, China thee ASPs has increased, because of the input costs increase, as well as we have higher mix in the US and other, you know, regions with relatively higher ASP.",Charlie Cao,4393388
,,,,
15717,Question-and-Answer,"Great. Thank you for the clarification, Charlie. As we look to next year, you talked about margins improving in Q1 and Q2, I know you haven't provided official guidance, but can you share how much improvement you see and also what kind of bookings do you see for Q1 and 2? And is the pricing also higher in those quarters, relative to Q4?",Philip Shen,4393388
,,,,
15718,Question-and-Answer,,Philip Shen,4393388
,,,,
15719,Question-and-Answer,"Phil, this is Gener. Let me take this booking question first. So for - I think in our last quarterly call, we established our strategy that Jinko as a tradition, we always target to achieve 50% level of the book - field before the year began. So I think that is still our strategy, we are on the right track to close that.",Gener Miao,4393388
,,,,
15720,Question-and-Answer,"The marketing side, you know, on the first side, we expect, you know, the material costs will down a little bit and including the polysilicon and we are seeing the polysilicon prices decreasing, to RMB25 [ph] now, and the glasses supply side will be you know, relatively - the supplies, the volume is stable, but the total Q1 and Q2, this global demand, you know, it's relatively lower, so we expected the material cost will have the contributions.",Gener Miao,4393388
,,,,
15721,Question-and-Answer,"On top of that, we are promoting the large size 182, the Tiger Pro, and the large size of the products and the production costs is lower. And we can charge the volume and we are expecting the 182 next year, as combined together next year, we'll get you know, 40%, 50%, you know, 182 in our shipments. And this part, you know, will help gradually quarter-by-quarter and improve our gross margin as well.",Gener Miao,4393388
,,,,
15722,Question-and-Answer,"Great. Yes, that larger format [ph] should be helpful. So thank you very much for the questions, guys. I'll pass it on.",Philip Shen,4393388
,,,,
15723,Question-and-Answer,Thank you.,Charlie Cao,4393388
,,,,
15724,Question-and-Answer,Thank you very much. Next we have Mr. Gary Zhou from Credit Suisse. The floor is yours.,Operator,4393388
,,,,
15725,Question-and-Answer,"Hello, management. Thank you for taking my questions. It is Gary from CS. So basically three question from my side. So firstly, can management share with us the latest update on your subsidiary stock market listing? And do you expect the timing of the Asia listing would have any impact on our capacity expansion decisions into the next one to two years?",Gary Zhou,4393388
,,,,
15726,Question-and-Answer,"And the second question is on something about the solar glass. So given the currently relatively high solar glass price, are we kind of holding back our motor [ph] production plant a little bit. So in other words, if there's not such kind of high raw material cost, would our fourth quarter module be otherwise higher?",Gary Zhou,4393388
,,,,
15727,Question-and-Answer,"And lastly, on the bifacial [ph] solar module, so just one small question, have we tried any ultra-wide floating glass as the backsheet eat of the solar class instead of solar glass and, if possible, can management share with us the economics comparison between two pieces of solar glass or using the backsheet as floating glass or even compared with transparent backsheet solution? Thank you.",Gary Zhou,4393388
,,,,
15728,Question-and-Answer,"A couple of questions and the first one is, you know, our subsidiaries, Jiangxi Jinko, we closed the equity financing, financial financing just by the end of October and we started the preparation for IPO in China immediately and the process is smooth and we will keep the market informed if we reach significant milestone.",Charlie Cao,4393388
,,,,
15729,Question-and-Answer,"And the second one is capacity, the funding for the capacity. And is that going to be depend, you know on the IPO process? If not, and we closed the 3.1 ? RMB3.1 [ph] and we think, you know, we have sufficient funding. And for the capacity expansion next year, and we will focus on the solar cell capacity, as well as some mono wafer capacity. And in the prepared remarks our CEO and we target to return you know, stable, slightly increasing on the integration levels and maintain returns 75%, 80% and to have good control of our you know, capabilities.",Charlie Cao,4393388
,,,,
15730,Question-and-Answer,"And on top of that, you talk about, I think the bifacial glasses and transparent?",Charlie Cao,4393388
,,,,
15731,Question-and-Answer,"I think we have two more question both regarding the glasses, right. I think, firstly, the beauty of our Jinko strategy is we have the certain flexibilities based on the market turbulence, that's why we have the geographic mix, and together with the product, different product portfolio mix. So, to conclude our conclusion, we are keeping the flexibility to adjust our capacities and also the factory output based on the market turbulence, we are keeping such kind of flexibility.",Gener Miao,4393388
,,,,
15732,Question-and-Answer,,Gener Miao,4393388
,,,,
15733,Question-and-Answer,"And the second question about the glass bifacial side. So, we have foreseen the, you know, the bottleneck of the glass supply, I think back a year ago, or even 1.5 years ago, that's why only promote the bifacial product, we do not offer only double glass, but also we offered transparent backsheet solution as well. So, both solutions are well accepted across industry and from our customer base, our customer feedback is neutrally well accepted.",Gener Miao,4393388
,,,,
15734,Question-and-Answer,"Meanwhile, for the ultra wide floating glass you just mentioned, I think the whole industry is trying to impose or trying to introduce such a glass to ease the short term supply from the solid glass manufacturing capabilities right now. And Jinko has done some progress on that way together with our peers. I think we are on that way, but its still, you know, the total volume available versus the demand that we are facing right now is still short of supply in terms of the glass. Hope that answer your question, Gary.",Gener Miao,4393388
,,,,
15735,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. Thank you very much. That's very clear. Thank you, management. And I?ll pass on.",Gary Zhou,4393388
,,,,
15736,Question-and-Answer,Thank you.,Gener Miao,4393388
,,,,
15737,Question-and-Answer,Thank you very much. Next we have Mr. Tony Fei from BOCI. The floor is yours.,Operator,4393388
,,,,
15738,Question-and-Answer,"Hi, management. Thanks for the questions. I have three from my side. The first one is regarding your operating margin. So in the third quarter, we see actually your operating margin has increased Q-on-Q despite your gross margin declined a little bit. So can you explain the reason behind it because we see you have quite a bit of savings in your sales and marketing expenses, despite the fact that shipping costs actually increased quite a bit in recent month. And if possible can you provide your guidance on the shipping costs in Q4?",Tony Fei,4393388
,,,,
15739,Question-and-Answer,"And second question is regarding your integration plan. So I think for 2021 your priority will be increasing your sales capacity in-house, but there has been quite a lot of debate regarding the economics of PERC and HJT on the cell technology route. So have you made a decision on how much of a new cell capacity will be PERC and how much from that will be in HJT?",Tony Fei,4393388
,,,,
15740,Question-and-Answer,"So the third question regarding exchange rate. So because of the RMB appreciation recently, do you see any impact on your order intakes, especially in overseas markets and if possible, do you have a plan on how much of your China order will increase in your sales mix in 2021? And do you expect to have increase in hedging costs for the currency side in next year? Thank you.",Tony Fei,4393388
,,,,
15741,Question-and-Answer,"And, you know, for first question is, I think, you know, the operating expenses, right, and, we expect relatively stable, operating expenses against revenues, roughly 11% quarter-over-quarter, including the fourth quarter.",Charlie Cao,4393388
,,,,
15742,Question-and-Answer,"And the question is the cell capacity, capacity, and we have not finalized the decision expecting we will expand basically the PERC capacity, but have the flexibility to upgrade to, you know, the entire TOPCon technology. And back to the TOPCon technology and we had 800 megawatts and ? tracing back to one year ago, and the efficiency is reaching to very good level. And we think that technology now is in relatively maturity stage. And so we - when we build the new capacities, of course, it's a big size and the big size PERC capacity, and we have the flexibility to upgrade to the TOPCon very quickly.",Charlie Cao,4393388
,,,,
15743,Question-and-Answer,"Exchange rate is ? it did have pressure, and we did had roughly 50%, the RMB against US dollars. And for the pricing, and we don't believe the 5% to 7%, you know, the exchange rates will have an impact on the demand side, and from international markets. And the customer are able to absorb the potential impact. So, we don't believe we have significant adjustment though for the mix, and China versus international markets because of the exchange rates.",Charlie Cao,4393388
,,,,
15744,Question-and-Answer,Great. Thanks for the color. I'll pass on.,Tony Fei,4393388
,,,,
15745,Question-and-Answer,,Tony Fei,4393388
,,,,
15746,Question-and-Answer,Thank you.,Charlie Cao,4393388
,,,,
15747,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you very much. Next, we have Mr. Brian Lee from Goldman Sachs. Mr. Brian Lee, you may ask your question.",Operator,4393388
,,,,
15748,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Charlie, could I go back to the previous question on OpEx? So I didn't capture, but why was SG&A so much lower this quarter? And what's the expectation for Q4 in terms of either absolute dollars or percentage of?",Brian Lee,4393388
,,,,
15749,Question-and-Answer,"In the third quarter, firstly, I think you know, the total, let's say the total revenue is increasing, right. And I think the total revenue there is some contribution. Second one is the - we have lowered marketing expenses, activities, and as well as you know, because of the relatively lower ASP, and when we calculate the warranty costs, the warranty costs relatively will be a little bit lower. So it's a combination of some one-off operating expenses, savings and revenue increase, as well as the decrease of warranty costs.",Charlie Cao,4393388
,,,,
15750,Question-and-Answer,Okay. And expectation for Q4?,Brian Lee,4393388
,,,,
15751,Question-and-Answer,"Q4 is roughly - because Q4 has roughly be the same, I think 11%.",Charlie Cao,4393388
,,,,
15752,Question-and-Answer,"11% of sales for just the SG&A line, is that the guidance?",Brian Lee,4393388
,,,,
15753,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. I mean, the operating expenses accounted for the total revenue is 11%, roughly, in the fourth quarter.",Charlie Cao,4393388
,,,,
15754,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. So OpEx in total, including R&D, not just SG&A? Okay, fair enough. I think you mentioned earlier, at one of the questions, I think it was maybe Phil at the beginning of the call. The ASP for 3Q, I think, if we just do the calculation, it was about $0.03, $0.04 per watt. The guidance for 4Q is down about sequentially.",Brian Lee,4393388
,,,,
15755,Question-and-Answer,"So maybe I misheard you, but it sounded like you were expecting 4Q, or is that just part of the mix. And the overall, I think blended, I think is still going to be down in 4Q?",Brian Lee,4393388
,,,,
15756,Question-and-Answer,"I mean, the ASP when you calculating is a little bit down, right?",Charlie Cao,4393388
,,,,
15757,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah, correct, by 3%, I think.",Brian Lee,4393388
,,,,
15758,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. Its not correct and I know the calculation. We use the total revenue with the P&L ? total shipments. And for the fourth - the third quarter, we have other revenues, some low efficiency solar cell and modules roughly. So the module revenue account for 95% and 5% is our revenue. So, when you do the ASP calculation in Q3, it will be relatively lower. Second one is when you do Q4, the guidance revenue, we don't consider our revenues, we just use the module revenues as a reference.",Charlie Cao,4393388
,,,,
15759,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. I think I captured that. I'm, you know, netting out the volume that's not related to modules and still getting to $0.24 for 3Q. But I could take that offline. But maybe can you just answer the question? What percentage increase in pricing are you expecting across the module mix for Q4 versus Q3?",Brian Lee,4393388
,,,,
15760,Question-and-Answer,"You mean the percentage ASP quarter-over-quarter, right?",Charlie Cao,4393388
,,,,
15761,Question-and-Answer,Yes.,Brian Lee,4393388
,,,,
15762,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. It's slightly increase, you know, the Q4 versus Q3. But I just talked about, you know, because we'll have higher mix in US and in China, the ASP has increased in the fourth quarter. So it's a combination which contributed to the increase of ASP in the fourth quarter.",Charlie Cao,4393388
,,,,
15763,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. Fair enough. Maybe two more if I could squeeze them in. Just one housekeeping one first, the third quarter, did you have the CapEx, depreciation and free cash flow numbers for the quarter?",Brian Lee,4393388
,,,,
15764,Question-and-Answer,"Okay, I can give you the ? let me check, I can give you the first quarter, third quarter, the nine month numbers, you know, the total CapEx for the nine month is roughly US$ 350 million. And operating cash flow is roughly negative US$200 million, which is because of the inventory now with a significant increase in inventory levels. And so depreciation each quarter is roughly let?s say US$40 million.",Charlie Cao,4393388
,,,,
15765,Question-and-Answer,"Okay, great. And then last one, I'll pass it on after this, is the Abu Dhabi sale, the 20% stake. I know that was outside of the quarter, but can you provide impact that you're expecting from that in 4Q. I thought you had been carrying it on the balance sheet of $50 million of value, and I think you sold it for $20 million?",Brian Lee,4393388
,,,,
15766,Question-and-Answer,,Brian Lee,4393388
,,,,
15767,Question-and-Answer,"So first question is, is that the correct math? And if so, why are you booked at your last year? And then last, I'm not sure if this is related, but why did the non-controlling interest [ph] on the balance sheet go down this quarter so much?",Brian Lee,4393388
,,,,
15768,Question-and-Answer,"Abu Dhabi project, we are currently in the long-term investment because it's investment on equity, 20%. And we signed you know, the sale purchase agreement with Jinko Power and the valuation is based on the independent third party valuation firms. And - but the closing are expected to be taking a longer time, maybe six months because it's subject to a lot of regulatory and including the government approvals.",Charlie Cao,4393388
,,,,
15769,Question-and-Answer,"And in terms of economics, and we don't expect significant impact and after the closing, but it?s a very small, you know, depending on the closing date.",Charlie Cao,4393388
,,,,
15770,Question-and-Answer,Okay. But it will be booked at a loss. And is there any impact this quarter from?,Brian Lee,4393388
,,,,
15771,Question-and-Answer,"No, not but because the closing is taking a longer time. So before the closing the economics of the Abu Dhabi project, we will enjoy the economics before the closing. So that is why I'm saying, you know, after the closing and depending on the timing and but, for sure, it's not loss situations, and it's a profit situation.",Charlie Cao,4393388
,,,,
15772,Question-and-Answer,Okay. What was the carrying value in the long term investment?,Brian Lee,4393388
,,,,
15773,Question-and-Answer,"I need to check, but it's -- on the balance sheet, we have separate items carrying the investment, and we can get back to you after the call.",Charlie Cao,4393388
,,,,
15774,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah, you reported $25.5 million in the quarter, but I suppose some of that is not Abu Dhabi?",Brian Lee,4393388
,,,,
15775,Question-and-Answer,Yeah. I need to check?,Charlie Cao,4393388
,,,,
15776,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah, I can take that off line. This last one, the non-controlling interest, it was down $100 million or close $200 million quarter-on-quarter? Any read into that?",Brian Lee,4393388
,,,,
15777,Question-and-Answer,"You mean the rationale, right? The non-controlling interest on the balance sheet?",Charlie Cao,4393388
,,,,
15778,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah, on the balance sheet, just wondering what's prompted the big move there?",Brian Lee,4393388
,,,,
15779,Question-and-Answer,"So, you know, it's because we - by the end of October we did the equity financing for the Jiangxi Jinko, the major subsidiaries. So before that, we - in some of our subsidiaries, we have arrangement with the energy fund being supported by the government. And because we have equity financing, we launched $3.1 billion and some more investors, they think it's good. We pick up some minority interest to the subsidiary levels.",Charlie Cao,4393388
,,,,
15780,Question-and-Answer,"So organized the arrangement with government's funded energy funds and some of the funds we plan to redeem in our near future, which is, you know, it's a purely equity investment from the government equity funds.",Charlie Cao,4393388
,,,,
15781,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. Thanks a lot, guys. I?ll pass it on.",Brian Lee,4393388
,,,,
15782,Question-and-Answer,Thank you.,Charlie Cao,4393388
,,,,
15783,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you, Mr. Brian. Yes, in absence of time, we will take the last question from the participants. Next we have Mr. William Graben from UBS. The floor is yours. Mr. Williams, please ask your question.",Operator,4393388
,,,,
15784,Question-and-Answer,"Great, thank you. I just have one quick, quick one here. Just wondering if you could clarify if there is any AD CVD true-ups that are impacting the fourth quarter guidance?",William Graben,4393388
,,,,
15785,Question-and-Answer,"It could be up a little bit, but it's not significant impact. So when we give the margins - when we give the margin guidance, we did not consider the positive impact.",Charlie Cao,4393388

15797,Presentation,"And with that, I'll turn the car over to Greg.",David Calusdian,4393364
,,,,
15798,Presentation,"Thank you, David, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We performed in line with our expectations for the third quarter, particularly in light of the ongoing effects of COVID-19. In the Product Identification segment, revenue and operating margin increased sequentially and year-on-year, while in Test & Measurement our results continue to reflect the effects of the pandemic on the commercial aerospace industry. Let me touch on each of these segments.",Greg Woods,4393364
,,,,
15799,Presentation,"On the Product Identification side, we're seeing the benefits of our new and fully-updated product offerings combined with the expanding emphasis on digital, sales and marketing. Our enhanced digital presence highlighted by our new website at astronovaproductid.com has been very well-received.",Greg Woods,4393364
,,,,
15800,Presentation,"Earlier this quarter, we launched the new site globally, which integrates our QuickLabel, TrojanLabel and GetLabel brands into one comprehensive site with state-of-the-art interactive capabilities. This site includes digital educational content such as online demonstrations, eBooks, White Papers and blogs to help customers to make informed decisions. The response from the user community to all of the newly added digital thought leadership content has been very positive across the board.",Greg Woods,4393364
,,,,
15801,Presentation,,Greg Woods,4393364
,,,,
15802,Presentation,"Product Identification revenue in the quarter of $22.9 million was up more than 5% year-over-year, nearly 6% on a sequential basis. Segment operating profit increased by 87% to $3.5 million due to the higher revenue as well as operating expense reductions. These results were driven by strong demand for our printers and suppliers through our new color label printers such as the QL-120X and the QL-850, as well as their recent release wide format, direct product and packaging printer, the T3-OPX, which continues to exceed our expectations.",Greg Woods,4393364
,,,,
15803,Presentation,"The rate of new customer acquisition was also favorable, which contributed to the segment's strong performance in Q3. Innovations in technology and applied marketing are cornerstones of our Product Identification growth strategy. At the recent PACK EXPO Connects digital trade show, we demonstrated a range of advanced new products that enable customers to further increase productivity, reduce waste, and drive those efficiencies to the bottom-line. These new offerings include several new products that expand our reach into our customer's Product Identification automation processes.",Greg Woods,4393364
,,,,
15804,Presentation,"For example, the LF-100 and LF-200 label finishers unpack all-in-one desktop finishing systems that add in line label lamination and dye cutting, saving production time and lowering video expenses; and the QTC based print and apply solution, a new downstream adjacency for us, that combines our label printing technology with high-speed automated robotic label placements. PACK EXPO Connects with our first large scale virtual trade show. We held eight interactive seminars as well as a broad range of video demo rooms, all were well received and well attended, and our sales teams are now busy following up with those attendees.",Greg Woods,4393364
,,,,
15805,Presentation,"Turning to Test & Measurement, not surprisingly the combination of COVID-19 and the 737 MAX grounding continue to adversely affect commercial printer deliveries in Q3. Segment revenue of $5.1 million was down about $6.4 million year-over-year and $900,000 sequentially. That being said, in light of recent developments, we're hopeful as the third quarter represents a low point for our T&M segments. Though we don't have a crystal ball, the potential of approved Coronavirus vaccines in the coming days and the FAA's November decision clearing the 737 MAX for return to service are positive signs for our commercial aerospace business as we move through fiscal 2022 and beyond.",Greg Woods,4393364
,,,,
15806,Presentation,"As the aviation industry works its way through what is expected to be a gradual recovery, we have restructured the commercial aerospace portion of our business to more closely align our operations with the current reduced production levels. Even these reduced operating levels however we have made sure to keep our core technical and support teams in place so that we can rapidly ramp up production as the current crises abate. In terms of recent highlights, during the third quarter, we announced the receipt of an exclusive multiyear commitment from a major North American carrier, which is deploying our narrow formats top-rated printers in its Boeing 737 aircraft. As I noted on the Q2 call, this will likely result in more than 200 printer orders during the term of that agreement.",Greg Woods,4393364
,,,,
15807,Presentation,"The defense portion of our customers in this segment while traditionally a much smaller component of revenues in commercial is growing and trending positively, in my last fall, I mentioned the receipt of a printer contract for military transport aircraft, and we continue to pursue similar airborne activities and opportunities. Additionally, we have received initial orders for our new data acquisition recorders and telemetry systems for evaluation at several U.S. and foreign military ground facilities. These early successes bode well for this next generation equipment.",Greg Woods,4393364
,,,,
15808,Presentation,,Greg Woods,4393364
,,,,
15809,Presentation,"Now, let me turn the call over to David for his financial review, after which I'll make some concluding remarks and then we'll open the line for questions. David?",Greg Woods,4393364
,,,,
15810,Presentation,"Thank you, Greg, and good morning everybody. Rather than repeating all the information on the earnings release, I'll just highlight a couple of key points about our P&L and balance sheet. In light of the ongoing economic impacts of COVID-19 and the 737 MAX impacts on us, in Q3we again remain focused on cost control initiatives as a result of actions that we've taken this year, including in the third quarter, operating expenses declined by about $2.5 million or 21% from the year earlier quarter. Through the first nine months of fiscal year '21, operating expenses are down $5.3 million or nearly 16%, which is about the same as a revenue percentage drop over that period.",David Smith,4393364
,,,,
15811,Presentation,"As a reminder, in the second quarter, we reduced executive compensation imposed across the board freeze on all other employee compensation in 2019 levels and reduced the host of expenses in professional and other services, travel and tradeshow expenses, and so forth. For fiscal 2021, we're still targeting in more than $7 million reduction in operating expenses compared with fiscal 2020. On a percentage basis, we're aiming to have the expense reduction exceed the decrease in revenue. One potential risk that targeted reduction is an uptick in COVID cases that is effective so that the past month and could result in higher personnel expenses in Q4.",David Smith,4393364
,,,,
15812,Presentation,"The operating margin in the quarter was 1.5%, up 20 basis points from the same period last year. As for non-cash charges, depreciation and amortization were $1.4 million and share-based compensation was 591,000. EBITDA in the quarter was 1.7 million or 6.1% of revenue. Through the first nine months of the year, EBITDA is 6.1 million or 7.1% of revenue. On the other expense line, we've reported expensive 436,000 in the quarter which primarily reflects interest expense and also some foreign exchange losses.",David Smith,4393364
,,,,
15813,Presentation,"Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter were 9.6 million. That was 17.9 million with 13.5 billion excluding the 4.4 million Payroll Protection Program loans, which we still expect will be forgiven. During the quarter, we paid down 2 million on a revolving credit debt and amortized another 800,000 in our term loan thus reducing our total debt by 2.8 million from the period ending August 1st.",David Smith,4393364
,,,,
15814,Presentation,We now have the full 10 million available under our revolving credit facility. Our debt structure challenges earlier this year after the two black swan events of the 737 MAX and COVID have been resolved. We are and expect to remain in compliance with all bank covenants and plan to refinance or restructure our debt facility at some point in the coming quarters. We're comfortable with our liquidity position relative to our operating requirements.,David Smith,4393364
,,,,
15815,Presentation,"In terms of working capital, at quarter end, the net of inventory and payables that declined about 1.2 million compared to the end of the fiscal second quarter, receivables were up 800,000 due to heavy shipments at the end of the quarter, but day sales outstandings are constant and other quality metrics are good.",David Smith,4393364
,,,,
15816,Presentation,"Another note because it comes up, we continue to pay the guaranteed minimum royalties to Honeywell under our asset purchase and license agreement, and that guaranteed liability shows up in current long-term liabilities on the balance sheet. But as in the second quarter, due to decline in aerospace volume, we had no excess royalty payments in the third quarter.",David Smith,4393364
,,,,
15817,Presentation,"With that, I'll turn the call back over to Greg.",David Smith,4393364
,,,,
15818,Presentation,"Thanks David. Looking ahead, we're optimistic that the third quarter momentum in our Product Identification business will continue in Q4, an exciting growing base of new customers and the ongoing ramp up of new products. On the Test & Measurement side, we're expecting fourth quarter revenue to be stronger than the third quarter based on anticipated contributions of shipments for defense applications.",Greg Woods,4393364
,,,,
15819,Presentation,,Greg Woods,4393364
,,,,
15820,Presentation,"Now, David and I'd be happy to take your questions. Operator?",Greg Woods,4393364
,,,,
15821,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dick Ryan with Colliers.,Operator,4393364
,,,,
15822,Question-and-Answer,"Greg, you mentioned on the Product ID side some new customer acquisitions. Can you give us a sense of how many new customers have come in? Or maybe just from a geographic standpoint, where are you seeing strength and weakness in the Product ID side with your new marketing initiative?",Dick Ryan,4393364
,,,,
15823,Question-and-Answer,"Sure. It's really pretty widespread, quite frankly, I mean, we still have some sectors like retail are not feeling well, but a lot of our segments now seem to be doing fairly well. The new customers North America, Europe and Asia, all have a good contribution of new customers. It's partly driven by new product because it's in the new market areas, as I highlighted. For example, the T3-OPX, which instead of printing labels, we shouldn't apply to a product. You can print directly onto packages, bags, would hold a variety of things.",Greg Woods,4393364
,,,,
15824,Question-and-Answer,"So that's opening up opportunities with, for example, commercial printers, as well as brand owners. So, they're new customer markets for us. And then even in the label business, we're getting more and more new customers as opposed that we always track percentage of upgrades, we were very high loyalty with our customer base, so that stays pretty consistent, but we keep a close eye on the actual new customers and new markets. One example I could try out there, which we pretty much see all across North America's CBD business. So, we're getting quite a few new customers there I think in a variety of states and territories.",Greg Woods,4393364
,,,,
15825,Question-and-Answer,Any COVID driven business creating opportunities for you?,Dick Ryan,4393364
,,,,
15826,Question-and-Answer,"We're still seeing that in terms of the janitorial cleaning supplies, chemical products that is actually still ramping, as well as medical products. At recent, we have several kind of PPE-type customers and actually medical tests companies too where you can label business. And recently, we've got few new customers and kind of the eye care area, which I don't that's really COVID related, but just a better penetration overall for our business within the medical industry.",Greg Woods,4393364
,,,,
15827,Question-and-Answer,"On the T&M side, the sequential increase anticipated for the aero side, is that pretty much driven by these new military contracts? And maybe a bigger perspective on the 737 MAX issue, is there the printers inventory has have to be worked through as their production ramped kind of slowly improve? Or is that kind of a book and ship business with our level of production?",Dick Ryan,4393364
,,,,
15828,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. So, with the Boeing 737 MAX, it's a bit of a mix. I mean, Boeing does keep some inventory, but they don't keep a lot. It's mainly customer purchase printers, which we then directly shipped to Boeing for their aircraft assembly as is coming on the production line. And as you know, as we started, but it's kind of in the single digit type of numbers as far as installing aircraft production, but we are seeing increases and then we'll mention the extra aircraft models, but there are some of them that we went through a dry spell of very low to no orders for several months.",Greg Woods,4393364
,,,,
15829,Question-and-Answer,"We have started to see those orders come into, a good chunk of those won't get until next fiscal year, but it's a good sign that moving in the right direction. So, what I'd say is, it's a mix of a slow uptick in the commercial business versus the head that going in the other way. And then, we do have a few of these different defense contracts that are due to shift in actually December and January that should give us a bit of a bump here in the fourth quarter.",Greg Woods,4393364
,,,,
15830,Question-and-Answer,"Okay, what does the Honeywell handoff? And I mean, obviously, it's you've got the COVID issues, but how much longer do you anticipate that impacting margins?",Dick Ryan,4393364
,,,,
15831,Question-and-Answer,,Dick Ryan,4393364
,,,,
15832,Question-and-Answer,"We're hopeful to wrap that up this quarter. I know we've been trying to get it done for a few quarters here, but COVID did have some impacts in terms of restructuring at other -- both at Airbus and Honeywell as well as our own organization. So that a little disruption to the contract negotiations, but we're certainly in the final stages right now. I would say, very high probability that we'll have it done in Q4. And then, that will -- the impact will start pretty much immediately from there.",Greg Woods,4393364
,,,,
15833,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I am showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Woods for closing remarks.",Operator,4393364
,,,,
15834,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you all for joining us here this morning. And on behalf of everyone at AstroNova, have a wonderful safe and healthy holiday season, and we look forward to keeping you informed and updated on our progress. Goodbye.",Greg Woods,4393364

,,,,
15843,Presentation,"Good morning and good evening, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. 2020 is a challenging year for China lodging industry due to the impact of COVID-19. However, we are very glad to see the whole industry is recovering, thanks a lot to the Chinese government's effective preventing measures and a cooperation from Chinese people. In addition, the recovery is also supported by various government stimulus policies released post the COVID-19 pandemic.",Ji Qi,4393332
,,,,
15844,Presentation,"Starting with the first slide. This year, the year of 2020 is also a very special year for Huazhu. It's our 15th anniversary. We also successfully completed our Hong Kong secondary listing in September, which is another big milestone for Huazhu. The secondary listing not only brought us more capital but also enhanced our company's competition in the whole market.",Ji Qi,4393332
,,,,
15845,Presentation,"Moving to pages 3 and 4. Every company has 2 slides -- 2 sides. Despite this huge challenge, COVID-19 also provided a golden opportunity to speed up consolidation in the upcoming years. Looking back to the last 2 decades of each crisis, such as SARS in 2003 and financial crisis in 2008, the chain penetration of China lodging industry accelerated. We believe it should repeat this time. In fact, compared with 2019, we saw the total number of hotel rooms decline by 3.7% as of Q3 2020, while chain hotel rooms actually increased by 2.8% during the same period. Therefore, we think industry leaders like us will see the consolidated markets.",Ji Qi,4393332
,,,,
15846,Presentation,"Now we move to Page 6. Huazhu is not a traditional hotel company. We build our unique 3-in-1 super composite business model. Business includes brand, traffic and technology.",Ji Qi,4393332
,,,,
15847,Presentation,,Ji Qi,4393332
,,,,
15848,Presentation,"Brand is fundamental. It means combine strong brand portfolio with a massive hotel network to achieve dominant offline presence. Our near-term target is to reach 10,000 hotels in 1,000 cities by 2022.",Ji Qi,4393332
,,,,
15849,Presentation,Traffic is crucial. It means more and more Europe sales driven by strong policy program.,Ji Qi,4393332
,,,,
15850,Presentation,Technology is a catalyst. It means future developing and utilization and to utilizing advanced technology to achieve full digital process and improve operational efficiency. We think the lodging industry is entering into a new stage. Our 3-in-1 super composite business model will still be in the leading position in supporting our long-term growth.,Ji Qi,4393332
,,,,
15851,Presentation,Now I will turn the call to Jin Hui to discuss our 2020 strategy review. Thanks.,Ji Qi,4393332
,,,,
15852,Presentation,"Thanks, Ji Qi. Good morning, everyone. Before we review our 2020 strategic review, I would like to firstly share with you our China business recovery situation and update.",Jin Hui,4393332
,,,,
15853,Presentation,"Please turn to Slide 8. From the occupancy rate, by fourth week of November, our weekly average occupancy rate was roughly 76%, which was 2.6 percentage points compared to last year.",Jin Hui,4393332
,,,,
15854,Presentation,"We're also very happy to see there were several weeks, actually, the occupancy rate was higher than last year same period.",Jin Hui,4393332
,,,,
15855,Presentation,"However, according to the STR data, the entire China lodging industry occupancy rate was only 62%, which was 7.2 percentage points lower compared to last year. Therefore, we can see that Huazhu continuously leading the recovery and achieved higher than industry recovery by 14 percentage points.",Jin Hui,4393332
,,,,
15856,Presentation,Turning to the Slide number 9. It shows our current recovery trend of the RevPAR. The trend also shows the tick shape to recover -- recovery trends mentioned by Ji Qi earlier.,Jin Hui,4393332
,,,,
15857,Presentation,"In September, our blended RevPAR has recovered to roughly 100% level compared to 2019. And in October, the recovery also achieved roughly 98% compared to 2019, which is close to 100%.",Jin Hui,4393332
,,,,
15858,Presentation,"However, considering the uncertainties might -- brought by the current recurrency -- recurrency of COVID-19 in Shanghai and the future potential of recurrency of COVID-19 in some other regions, during the winter season, we still hold quite cautiously optimistic view for the next 1 to 2 quarters.",Jin Hui,4393332
,,,,
15859,Presentation,Turning into the Page 10. It shows that was our 3 key strategic focus for 2020.,Jin Hui,4393332
,,,,
15860,Presentation,"There were 3 main parts. The first one is on the accelerated quality hotel expansion, and second one is on the multi-dimensional direct sales, and the last one is the global technology-based shared service platform. Me and Liu Xinxin will introduce an update on these 3 areas.",Jin Hui,4393332
,,,,
15861,Presentation,"I will firstly discuss on the accelerated quality hotel expansion area. And after my part, I will let Liu Xinxin introduce on the direct sales and global technology-based shares service platform part.",Jin Hui,4393332
,,,,
15862,Presentation,"Okay. Please look at Slide number 11 for the hotel expansion. This year, we focused on more quality expansion. By looking at our new signings of hotels this year, from the first quarter to the third quarter, we have been seeing that our soft brand's signing numbers has been declining, while our standardized brand's signing numbers has been accelerating.",Jin Hui,4393332
,,,,
15863,Presentation,"We also optimized our soft brand strategy. First of all, we redefined our soft brand strategy by removing soft brand hotels that do not meet our quality standard as well as raising the entry threshold for the soft brand hotels.",Jin Hui,4393332
,,,,
15864,Presentation,"And also, our soft brand now has been serving as our reservoir of our -- for our standardized brand and the preparation for the future standardized brand expansion.",Jin Hui,4393332
,,,,
15865,Presentation,"And also, we have been continuously upgrading our products to enhance our product quality. You can look at our Slide number 12.",Jin Hui,4393332
,,,,
15866,Presentation,"In the Slide 12, that shows that we have introduced and launched our new version for HanTing brand and Hi Inn brand. For the HanTing brand, we upgraded from 2.0 to 3.5, and Hi Inn brand, we upgraded from 4.0 to 6.0. Also in the Page 13, for our acquired brands, we also introduced and launched our Orange and Crystal Orange brands from 1.0 to 2.0 version.",Jin Hui,4393332
,,,,
15867,Presentation,,Jin Hui,4393332
,,,,
15868,Presentation,"In Slide 14, on the hotel expansion, we also focus on more lower-tier cities' penetration this year.",Jin Hui,4393332
,,,,
15869,Presentation,"At the end of October, there were roughly 44% of our net openings of hotels come from the Tier 3 and below cities, close to 50% of our net openings.",Jin Hui,4393332
,,,,
15870,Presentation,"By looking at our existing hotels and pipelines. In the existing sales network, there were roughly 70 -- roughly 33% of sales comes from the third tier -- 3-tier and lower -- below cities, and there were roughly 50% of the pipeline comes from the lower-tier cities.",Jin Hui,4393332
,,,,
15871,Presentation,"Now turning into the Slide 15. As Ji Qi mentioned earlier, post the COVID-19, there will be a consolidation acceleration. By looking into Huazhu's new signings data, which also shows this trend, from the January to October, the first 10 months, our conversion rate achieved 59%, which was higher than last year, 54%. This is a very clear trend on the consolidation acceleration.",Jin Hui,4393332
,,,,
15872,Presentation,"With that, Liu Xinxin will give you an update on the sales and technology areas.",Jin Hui,4393332
,,,,
15873,Presentation,"Thanks, Jin Hui. Good morning and good evening, everyone. As shown on our Slide 15, we are glad to see a very strengthening recovery of direct sales post the COVID-19 outbreak in Q1. In Q3, rooms night contributed by members have recovered to nearly the same level of last year at roughly 75%, and the central reservation contribution of room nights also recovered to the same level of last year at 56 percentage.",Liu Xinxin,4393332
,,,,
15874,Presentation,"As of Q3, we have total over 115 million members, which we think still small as our target is to sell broad population. Therefore, we continually develop new strategy to further expand our membership base.",Liu Xinxin,4393332
,,,,
15875,Presentation,"Move on to Page 17. Our current strategy for attracting new member focus on entire life cycle of customers' hotel staying, from before check-in to after check-out. Customers who scans the QR code, we provided to become our member for using various facilities and functions of our hotel, such as room TV projection, laundry service and invoice service and so on. Compared to previous major way to convert nonmember to members through the frontdesk staff, our new multiple touch point strategy is much more -- most and efficient without incremental staff cost.",Liu Xinxin,4393332
,,,,
15876,Presentation,"Turning to Page 18, corporate sales is another key focus this year. Since Q1, we have been putting a lot of efforts to divest corporate clients and helping an initial fruitful outcome in Q3. By the end of Q3, our total corporate clients increased by 33% to 12,000 compared to 2019 year-end. We are directly linked with B2B and Huazhu's app from headquarter to headquarter, particularly corporate-to-corporate. And in Chinese, we call it [Foreign Language].",Liu Xinxin,4393332
,,,,
15877,Presentation,"Also, our penetration to top 3,000 public listed companies ranked by market cap and revenue increased to 30% in Q3 compared to only 10% in 2019. We are aiming to have 100% penetration rate by the end of 2021.",Liu Xinxin,4393332
,,,,
15878,Presentation,"Move on to Page 19. Given the increase in corporate clients, our room lines contributed by corporate clients increased to 10% in Q3 from 8% in Q1, up 10%. More importantly, as our hotel rooms are still expanding, the absolute number of room nights contributed by corporate clients increased more significantly by over 40% year-over-year to nearly 4 million in Q3.",Liu Xinxin,4393332
,,,,
15879,Presentation,"Moving to DH. Recall that we announced a 500-day digitalization planned for DH in Q1 earnings release. As of Q3, we had achieved a lot of progresses from various aspects, as shown in Slide '20. Despite in -- despite the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic, prolonged recovery in Europe. But our digitalization plan remains unchanged. We expect the whole process to be completed by the middle of next year. We would like to fully utilize why China's confidence of high operational efficiently and advanced technology capabilities to further optimize the DH operation for better efficiency and profitability in the future.",Liu Xinxin,4393332
,,,,
15880,Presentation,,Liu Xinxin,4393332
,,,,
15881,Presentation,"In conclusion, as mentioned by Ji Qi earlier, direct sales is an enhancer and technology is essential and catalyst. Both are crucial part of our 3-in-1 super composite winning formula to support its long-term sustainable growth. Hence, we would continually reinforce our direct sales efforts and further develop our advanced technology capability.",Liu Xinxin,4393332
,,,,
15882,Presentation,Now I will turn the call to Teo to discuss our Q3 operational and financial review. Thanks.,Liu Xinxin,4393332

15883,Presentation,"Thank you, Xinxin, and good morning, everyone. As Ji Qi mentioned earlier, this dynamic will have to accelerate the lodging industry's consolidations. As shown on Slide 22, at the end of Q3, we had a total now of 6,507 hotels with 634,087 of rooms in operations, an increase of 26% from Q3 2019. Excluding the 23,322 rooms of Deutsche Hospitality hotel rooms, at the end of Q3, Legacy Huazhu also recorded a room inventory growth of 21%, with 610,765 rooms at the end of Q3.",Teo Nee Chuan,4393332

15885,Presentation,"Our European business has also been recovering steadily in Q2 up to late September. However, the second wave of the pandemic in Europe since late September has impacted a number of countries in Europe. For example, a number of countries imposed lockdowns from the beginning of November that causes a decline in hotel occupancy. I will share more at the later part of my presentation.",Teo Nee Chuan,4393332

15897,Presentation,"Excluding DH, hotel operating cost was CNY 1.94 billion compared to CNY 1.95 billion in 2019. The higher hotel operating costs mainly was due to the higher rental expenses. It was due to increase in rental expenses, depreciation and amortizing costs, consumables that was related to several new upscale leased and operated hotels that had started business in this year. In addition, higher other operating costs also included a provision for impairment for assets related to terminated leased and operated hotels of CNY 15 million.",Teo Nee Chuan,4393332

At the peak of COVID-19 in Europe at end March, early April, the local government has requested close to 3/4 or 73% of these hotels to contain the spread of COVID-19 virus. Since May, European government has gradually reopened the economy following some early success in the containment of this pandemic. In this connection, we saw a steady recovery of occupancy up to 42% at the end of September.",Teo Nee Chuan,4393332

15916,Presentation,"With that, please open the floor for questions. Thank you.",Teo Nee Chuan,4393332
,,,,
15917,Question-and-Answer,[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Justin Kwok from Goldman Sachs.,Operator,4393332
,,,,
15918,Question-and-Answer,"Perhaps I got three questions, two more on the strategic side and one on -- more on the recent operations. The first one on the strategic side is that, as you mentioned about the market consolidation post COVID and not to raise the crisis, what are you seeing in terms of the M&A landscape, be it in onshore China or in other markets that you operate, like in Europe or the rest of Asia? What's your appetite now? And what are you seeing in terms of opportunities? Are you very ready to make a move or are you close to make a move on that side?",Justin Kwok,4393332
,,,,
15919,Question-and-Answer,"The second question is about the high-end hotel business. It seems that in the past 40 minutes of presentation, there wasn't a lot of discussion on the high-end hotel business segment. Can you share a bit more on what's the progress there in terms of how the DH brand would be potentially rolled out in China, et cetera? What are your preparation on that?",Justin Kwok,4393332
,,,,
15920,Question-and-Answer,"And the last one about more recent operations. Obviously, your occupancy is more or less back to pre-COVID level. What are your expectation now on the room rates, especially into 2021? Do you expect to see some resumption of like-for-like growth in your room rates overall in China? That's the 3 questions.",Justin Kwok,4393332
,,,,
15921,Question-and-Answer,"So basically, for the top-tier companies, like us, and other choose owned companies actually, those choose and owned companies supported by us and be supported by the capital markets. But post the COVID-19, we have been seeing some minor opportunities, is more like the cooperation instead of a major M&A.",Jin Hui,4393332
,,,,
15922,Question-and-Answer,"Not only for introducing the DH brands to the mainland China, we also introduced several new products, such as Joya Hotel and [Hua Ting Tao] Blossom. And as a Chinese old saying, that we have to build our house during the sunny days. So basically, currently, the overall market is still during a quite tough period. So Huazhu is always trying to move back in advance before the market gets too hot. So as we have been dominating or we have been quite -- have a strong presence in the middle scale and economic hotels, we want to move a step forward to enter into the upscale market.",Jin Hui,4393332
,,,,
15923,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. In terms of the ADR recovery, so actually, you have been seeing that the OCC has recovered roughly the same level as 2019. However, for the ADR recovery, it really depends on the entire lodging industry recovery, especially for the middle upscale and upscale segment. Because as you can see, post the COVID-19, this middle upscale and upscale hotels, ADR has been under quite a lot of pressures.",Jin Hui,4393332
,,,,
15924,Question-and-Answer,"We also analyzed a very mature market in the U.S. in terms of the hotel recovery after the crisis. We have been seeing that the trend is kind of similar, that OCC has been leading the recovery while ADR has to be followed.",Jin Hui,4393332
,,,,
15925,Question-and-Answer,"As they?re expecting that the vaccine will be available in the next 1 or 2 quarters, so we are remaining quite confident that ADR could be ? continuously trend up. And I think, especially for our very good presence in terms of the economic and the middle-scale hotels, we think the ADR for these segments could be recovered slightly faster. However, for the upscale and ? middle upscale and upscale segment, it?s probably going to take a longer time.",Jin Hui,4393332
,,,,
15926,Question-and-Answer,Your next question comes from the line of Billy Ng of Bank of America.,Operator,4393332
,,,,
15927,Question-and-Answer,,Operator,4393332
,,,,
15928,Question-and-Answer,"I have two questions here. First of all, I just want to follow-up on the RevPAR questions that Justin just asked. Can you tell us a little bit more on the same-store RevPAR trend? I think from the presentation, you guys showed that the blended RevPAR is largely recovered at this point. But can you tell us a bit more on the same-store RevPAR trend at this point and what you are seeing recently? And also in terms of the revenue guidance for the fourth quarter, what's the implied same-store RevPAR that you guys are using in order to get to the 4% to 7% decline of the revenue from China for the fourth quarter 2020? That's my first question. And I will ask another question later, yes.",Billy Ng,4393332
,,,,
15929,Question-and-Answer,"Billy, this is Teo. The revenue guidance is actually based on the blended RevPAR rather than same-store RevPAR. The same-store RevPAR was actually slightly below the blended RevPAR because the blended RevPAR, taking into account of the new hotels opening, okay? So it's like a couple of percentage below. However, if they are actually taking line by line, the recoveries in the blended RevPAR also reflects the same hotel RevPAR recovery as well.",Teo Nee Chuan,4393332
,,,,
15930,Question-and-Answer,"Now to answer the second question, is that the -- in November -- in October, November, we have seen pretty strong recoveries in Q4. However, it's that the -- because there is some resurgence in the, particularly in the bigger cities like Shanghai and Tianjin, we have actually taken a more conservative look on -- outlook on the blended RevPAR for December. So we are actually expecting approximately 85% to 90% of recoveries. So -- but let's see how it goes.",Teo Nee Chuan,4393332
,,,,
15931,Question-and-Answer,"But so far, the trend is actually on the positive side, actually at the high end or even slightly higher than the higher end of estimates. But there are still 3 more weeks to go. So we have to remain cautious and we watch the numbers closely. Thank you.",Teo Nee Chuan,4393332
,,,,
15932,Question-and-Answer,"And my second question is, in terms of your presentation, you guys also showed that the Tier 3, Tier 4 cities' exposures is increasing, and more than half of the pipeline will come from the Tier 3, Tier 4 cities' exposure. And I just wonder, can you tell us roughly what kind of profitability for the franchisees in Tier 3, Tier 4 cities achieving right now in terms of the return and in terms of the margin? And how does that compare to the Tier 1, Tier 2 cities' franchisees?",Billy Ng,4393332
,,,,
15933,Question-and-Answer,"And also in terms of RevPAR, going forward, what do you think the difference between Tier 1, Tier 2 cities and the Tier 3, Tier 4 cities hotel RevPAR? Is that going to be like a 30%, 40% difference? Or what should be the right number to think of?",Billy Ng,4393332
,,,,
15934,Question-and-Answer,"Billy, it's Teo again. Now I think to answer the questions on the profitability of the lower-tier cities. Now this is still how we see it. I would say that the hotel operations, the largest cost of hotel, which is actually rental, people cost and depreciation and amortizations. Now we have to acknowledge that currently, at this moment, what we have seen is that the RevPAR for the lower-tier cities are actually lower compared to the higher-tier cities, okay?",Teo Nee Chuan,4393332
,,,,
15935,Question-and-Answer,"But having said that, is that the stronger recoveries in lower-tier cities, actually, you can see that they closer to maybe the range of the higher-tier cities. So actually, the RevPAR has been pretty good or even slightly better compared to the higher-tier cities.",Teo Nee Chuan,4393332
,,,,
15936,Question-and-Answer,"However, the rental cost in the lower-tier cities are much lower. The people costs are much lower, while the depreciation and amortizing costs are relatively the same compared to the higher tier cities. Now I won't be able to comment exactly on the exact profitability to the franchisees. But having said that, what we have seen -- what the franchisees said back -- is when they are making the investment decisions on opening up Huazhu's hotels, they are not comparing the hotels in higher-tier cities. The reason is because in -- for the hotel business, it's a local business. The local franchisees, they have connections in the lower-tier cities to secure the properties. On the other hand, they were not able and they do not have access to the business network in the higher-tier cities to secure the properties. So they are not comparing that. It's number one.",Teo Nee Chuan,4393332
,,,,
15937,Question-and-Answer,,Teo Nee Chuan,4393332
,,,,
15938,Question-and-Answer,"Number two is that with the excess of the properties in lower-tier cities, they are actually comparing -- by opening Huazhu hotels compared to other brands in the local areas or compared to the other commercial activities in the local areas. We have to acknowledge that the business activities in lower-tier cities are slightly lower because of this lower disposable income. But on the other hand, is that they would -- for our franchisees, what they are looking for is getting the better yield of per square meter for the properties that they have access, to the property they have access to. This is number one.",Teo Nee Chuan,4393332
,,,,
15939,Question-and-Answer,"Number two, from Huazhu perspective, is that Huazhu's fee revenue is actually on the percentage of the total hotel turnover. And from our perspective, it's that because -- Huazhu's operating leverage is very high because the way we operate using the centralized operating platform. Our incremental cost compared to our fee revenue is minimal, so this is actually a win-win situation for both the franchisees as well as Huazhu. Thank you.",Teo Nee Chuan,4393332
,,,,
15940,Question-and-Answer,"Just one quick follow-up is -- sorry. Just -- so in terms of the RevPAR difference between Tier 1 and Tier 3, Tier 4 cities, is that widening or is that narrowing? And how much exactly are we talking about right now?",Billy Ng,4393332
,,,,
15941,Question-and-Answer,"The RevPAR trend is actually narrowing. The recovery -- as I mentioned earlier, is that the recoveries for -- the RevPAR in the lower-tier cities is actually higher compared to the higher-tier cities. So the gaps are actually narrowing.",Teo Nee Chuan,4393332
,,,,
15942,Question-and-Answer,"I just want to give some supplement information in terms of our lower-tier cities' penetration strategy. So over the past 15 years, we have been serving roughly 300 million to 400 million urban people, populations. But we are targeting to serve up to 1.4 billion populations for all the -- or consumers. And by doing this, we can further strengthen our direct sales and serve more customers. Thank you.",Jin Hui,4393332
,,,,
15943,Question-and-Answer,[Foreign language],Billy Ng,4393332
,,,,
15944,Question-and-Answer,"For the lower-tier cities? penetrations, because over the past few years, the urbanization rate for the ? in the lower-tier cities has been increasing, and we have been seeing the population in this lower-tier cities has been also increasing. And until now, what we have observed, that actually in the lower-tier cities, our middle-scale hotels performed pretty well. And especially, for example, our JI Hotels, actually, their performance has exceeded our previous expectation.",Jin Hui,4393332
,,,,
15945,Question-and-Answer,"So going forward, in terms of our lower-tier cities? penetrations, we will use both middle-scale brands and economic brands. So we think both are going to work. Thank you.",Jin Hui,4393332
,,,,
15946,Question-and-Answer,Your next question comes from the line of Lina Yan from HSBC.,Operator,4393332
,,,,
15947,Question-and-Answer,"My question is regarding the structure of the new store -- new hotel opening while you maintained the 1,600 to 1,800 new opening. But judging from the 9 months new hotel additions, the opening like in midscale seems to be like below the target in the beginning of the year. So I'm wondering if this is like something temporary? Or it's going to like be last for -- like for a while, this kind of like shift in opening mix towards more economy-type? Because as Teo mentioned, like our same hotel RevPAR is normally a couple of percentage points below the blended RevPAR because we always have this like a mix type of drivers. But this year, it's kind of like different from previous years. So I want to understand this point.",Lina Yan,4393332
,,,,
15948,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. I will discuss the -- I will answer your questions. So due to the COVID-19 pandemic impact, basically, a lot of middle-scale and middle upscale hotels due to the delay for the construction given the low liquidity, especially in the second quarter, so there will be some of the delay for the new openings. And secondly, we have to say there is a possibility that a lot of franchisees who used to focus on the middle to upscale hotels, but due to the heavy CapEx and the impact by the COVID-19, they're probably going to delay their demand.",Jin Hui,4393332
,,,,
15949,Question-and-Answer,,Jin Hui,4393332
,,,,
15950,Question-and-Answer,"Specifically for the Starway brand hotels, actually, we have been -- we have been increase -- or we have been rising the entry thresholds for the Starway franchisees, and we also increased the quality standard as well. So that's another reason for this particular brand to have less openings this year.",Jin Hui,4393332
,,,,
15951,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. That's very clear. But is there any data you can share, for example, the monthly opening? Have we seen like picking up in the opening of new midscale hotels?",Lina Yan ,4393332
,,,,
15952,Question-and-Answer,"We have been working on our new openings plan for next year 2021, and we have been deciding to have the middle-scale hotels openings to return to the previous general, normal level.",Jin Hui,4393332
,,,,
15953,Question-and-Answer,"I just want to add one more note. We ? actually, we have seen that in November, December, we have seen that the hotel openings for the midscale has picked up the pace. Thank you.",Ji Qi,4393332

,,,,
15968,Presentation,,Virgilio Gibbon,4393144
,,,,
15969,Presentation,"Moving to Page 5. We'll discuss our main highlights. Starting with our top line. Third-quarter adjusted net revenue increased 52% year over year, mostly due to maturation of our medical school seats and consolidation of acquired companies. It's also important to highlight that the discounts granted by the state decrees and legal proceedings due to COVID-19 on site classes restrictions did not impact us materially and represent around 1% of our net rev in this third quarter. In 2020, profitability continues to run ahead of last year, as we not only grow the business, but we are capturing synergies from acquisitions to leverage net growth.",Virgilio Gibbon,4393144
,,,,
15970,Presentation,"Adjusted EBITDA margin increased 340 basis points year over year and net income was up 47% to BRL101 million. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately BRL1.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet and the cash conversion for nine months 2020 was 86%. Despite any short-term challenges posed by COVID-19, we remain confident in our strong cash flow and healthy balance sheets to manage through the current crisis and beyond. With respect to M&A, our team continues to successfully execute both on generating and closing new business, as well as, capturing synergies.",Virgilio Gibbon,4393144
,,,,
15971,Presentation,"We are particularly pleased with our acquisitions in the digital health service with PEBMED, which is quickly followed up with iClinic and MedPhone. At the same time, we continue to grow our medical seats, acquiring two companies during the quarter and another one subsequent to quarter end. With these acquisitions, we are now at 85% of our IPO three-year target of adding 1,000 medical seats. On a separate topic, I'm very pleased to share that we were the winners in the education sector in the Epoca Negocios 360 survey.",Virgilio Gibbon,4393144
,,,,
15972,Presentation,"This award, which has been held annually for seven years is one of the most significant in the communications industry and recognizes companies that are market leaders across six different categories, including financials, corporate governance and sustainability, vision and human resources. Besides that, we also have won the Golden Tombstone in the equity category. This award is evaluated by IBEF Sao Paulo and recognizes equity operations in aspects such as complexity of the transactions, innovation, price, and others and Afya's award was due to our successful IPO in 2019.",Virgilio Gibbon,4393144
,,,,
15973,Presentation,"Moving next to a discussion of our recent digital acquisitions on Page number 6. Even during these challenging times, we remain committed to deliver innovation to our students, faculty, and other healthcare professionals. COVID did not slow down implementation of our strategic initiatives. In fact, we have accelerated our digital investments.",Virgilio Gibbon,4393144
,,,,
15974,Presentation,"We are expanding our digital offers and we began this digital journey with the acquisition of PEBMED, which we discussed on the last quarter call. As a reminder, PEBMED provides tools and content for healthcare professions through the WhiteBook and Nursebook apps and through the PEBMED news portal. It's also the market leader in clinical decision software and is an extremely popular app, ranking the top 10 Brazilian apps by consumer spend and NPS of 85. The business model consists of both paid subscription and free content, providing an additional source of revenue for us.",Virgilio Gibbon,4393144
,,,,
15975,Presentation,"We followed this with the acquisition of iClinic, a leading practice management software for physicians in Brazil, which includes electronic medical records, clinical management system, telemedicine, and a complete marketplace that connects doctors and patients with schedule consultations. We currently have close to 12,000 monthly subscribers with monthly average per user of 107 hands. With this acquisition, we have strengthened our position into the digital health service segment, complementing our end-to-end offering to the healthcare professions, and providing another revenue source.",Virgilio Gibbon,4393144
,,,,
15976,Presentation,,Virgilio Gibbon,4393144
,,,,
15977,Presentation,"And subsequent to quarter end, we announced the acquisition of MedPhone, the number two medical app in Brazil behind WhiteBook, a PEBMED company. MedPhone has 175,000 registered users and close to 60,000 monthly active users, a 4.9 score in app store with more than 9,100 reviews. The integration of MedPhone's clinical decision software with PEBMED will generate synergies and allow us to offer both products from the same platform. Importantly, the founders of these acquired companies will join Afya and will be an integral part of the digital team driving our growth in the health tech services.",Virgilio Gibbon,4393144
,,,,
15978,Presentation,"These have been key acquisitions for us as they accelerate our digital efforts to improve the user experience and efficiency of both healthcare students and other healthcare professionals. There are approximately 500,000 doctors in Brazil and close to half of them are currently using our digital products and services. Our goal is to improve even more penetration to support the largest majority of physicians in Brazil with our digital health service platform.",Virgilio Gibbon,4393144
,,,,
15979,Presentation,"Now on Page number 7. We'll discuss our overall strategic positioning. As we look to the future, we see the opportunity to maintain a long-term relationship with physicians from the time they enter into our school as undergraduate through the residency prep, specialization studies, and then through their entire career. We believe the investments in our medical programs and new digital health products will provide growth and revenue impact for many years, as well as, strengthening our relationship with medical students and other healthcare professionals.",Virgilio Gibbon,4393144
,,,,
15980,Presentation,"Importantly, our digital investments are already paying off by opening new business revenue opportunities for us. We will also continue to consider acquisition targets. And as shown on the bar chart on the right, we have been adding medical seats, 851 seats in just 15 months while also increasing our geographic footprint. This increase in medical seats drives a predictable revenue stream and maximized cash flow predictability as well.",Virgilio Gibbon,4393144
,,,,
15981,Presentation,"We are also looking to further grow our digital assets through disciplined acquisitions of business, complementary to, as well as, further broadening this business. Importantly, our balance sheet remains healthy with positive cash flow generation that provides us with the results to continue to grow the business both organically and through M&A.",Virgilio Gibbon,4393144
,,,,
15982,Presentation,"Turning up and before turning the call over to Luis, our accompaniments 2020 as we continue to navigate through an unprecedented environment are proof of the strength and resilience of our business model and the exceptional work of our passionate team. We are focused on creating shareholder value by delivering our financial targets, investing in growth, driving top-line momentum, and implementing our strategic priorities.",Virgilio Gibbon,4393144
,,,,
15983,Presentation,I will now turn the call over to Luis for a further discussion of our financial results and second-half 2020 guidance. Thank you.,Virgilio Gibbon,4393144
,,,,
15984,Presentation,"Thank you, Virgilio, and good morning, everyone. Moving to Page 9. Similar to past calls, my discussion this morning will focus on the main and most significant P&L items. There is additional info in the earnings press release that you can refer to for further more information.",Luis Andre Blanco,4393144
,,,,
15985,Presentation,"I'm pleased that we delivered another good quarter across all key metrics. Let me highlight a few. Both medical seats and students saw a significant increase during the quarter. With respect to the number of medical seats, we added 294 seats year over year for a total of 1,516 seats.",Luis Andre Blanco,4393144
,,,,
15986,Presentation,"Reflecting the seat maturation process and acquisitions, the total number of students in the third-quarter 2020 was 9,567 students, an increase of 50% over the same period of the prior year. Adjusted net revenue for the quarter, which includes the impact of the state decrees and individual and collective legal proceedings related to the strongest grade rated to COVID-19 on site classes restrictions was up 52% year on year to BRL313 million, partially benefiting for recognition of revenue that has been deferred earlier on the year when practical classes were unable to take place. This deferred revenue amounted to BRL14.4 million in the quarter. Excluding the acquisition of UniRedentor, Sao Lucas, and PEBMED, net revenue grew by 16% year over year reaching BRL239 million.",Luis Andre Blanco,4393144
,,,,
15987,Presentation,,Luis Andre Blanco,4393144
,,,,
15988,Presentation,"The increase was primarily driven by organic revenue growth, mainly due to the maturation of medical school seats, and increase in the average ticket. The strong top-line growth combined with cost efficiency and synergies from acquisitions was reflected in adjusted EBITDA increasing 63% to BRL149 million and margin expanding 340 basis points. Adjusted EBITDA also benefited from the inclusion of the deferred revenue I just mentioned. Excluding the consolidation of UniRedentor, Sao Lucas, and PEBMED, adjusted EBITDA increased 32% year over year to BRL121 million, a margin increase of 620 basis points to 50.4%.",Luis Andre Blanco,4393144
,,,,
15989,Presentation,"Adjusted net income increased 47% from the third-quarter 2019, reflecting the revenue contribution, synergies captured, and margin expansion from the consolidation of acquisitions. Earnings per share increased 48% from BRL0.54 in the third-quarter 2019 to BRL0.80 in the third-quarter 2020.",Luis Andre Blanco,4393144
,,,,
15990,Presentation,"Moving on to Page 10 for a discussion of key operating metrics by business unit. We delivered solid growth across both business units. Growth in key operating metrics as shown on this slide, is being driven by a combination of organic growth and acquisitions. Starting with BU1, our average monthly medical tuition fees at the nine months were BRL8,053, which was 17% above the same period in 2019. This reflects the combination of new students enrolling with a higher tuition rate combined with students graduating with a lower tuition. As a reminder, this does not include UniRedentor and Sao Lucas.",Luis Andre Blanco,4393144
,,,,
15991,Presentation,"As shown in the middle chart, 78% of our combined tuition fees are derived from medical schools, up from 69% in the same period of the prior year. The combination of 50% increase in the number of students and a 17% increase in the average ticket, resulted in net tuition fees of 41% when compared with the same period of the prior year. With respect to BU2, we have 130,000 active paying users at the quarter end, which included 95,000 from PEBMED. Excluding PEBMED for the nine-month period, we saw a 40% increase in active paying students. We saw the largest increase of 132% in the specialization due to the acquisitions of UniRedentor.",Luis Andre Blanco,4393144
,,,,
15992,Presentation,"Now turning to Page 11 for a discussion about different tractions we are gaining from our digital assets. All these recently acquired businesses are also helping to elevate our brand, as well as, deepening our connections with students and physicians. We have focused our efforts over the last year on continuing to enhance the student experience.",Luis Andre Blanco,4393144
,,,,
15993,Presentation,"We're closely monitoring their behavior and targets, personalized approach to keep them engaged. The digital investments that we have made enable us to agile and ensure that we are supporting our students as well the broader healthcare industry with what is so important to them, quickly and timely access to important medical information. This is more critical now than ever and is also a key leverage for both member of acquisitions and retention. And so on the charts on this page, we are seeing positive gains from our move to digital engagement.",Luis Andre Blanco,4393144
,,,,
15994,Presentation,"In the third quarter, combined monthly active users across our Medcel and PEBMED platform, we are close to 180,000 users. On the chart on the right, you can see the trend in the current consumptions. Content that users are consuming included podcasts, learning assets, as well as, structured medical webinars. We are also seeing a positive traction here with a 9% increase when compared to the first quarter of 2020 when we began our push into digital assets.",Luis Andre Blanco,4393144
,,,,
15995,Presentation,"The higher performance in the second quarter is partially reflective of our opening up of our digital assets for free at the start of the pandemic to our students and healthcare professions temporarily inflating up the number of users. In summary, we keep looking for ways to modify and enhance our business units to elevate our service offerings. And as we further build our additional capabilities, we will have strong foundations of products offering to support our long-term growth objectives to empower the physician.",Luis Andre Blanco,4393144

15996,Presentation,,Luis Andre Blanco,4393144
,,,,
15997,Presentation,"Moving on to a deeper analysis of revenue and EBITDA on Slide 12. As shown on this page, we have provided the net revenue and adjusted EBITDA from our historical third-quarter 2019 revenues to the reported third-quarter 2020. For the nine-month period, adjusted net revenue increased 62.3% to BRL860 million.",Luis Andre Blanco,4393144
,,,,
15998,Presentation,"Excluding UniRedentor, Sao Lucas, and PEBMED, adjusted net revenue grew 35% through September through BRL750 million with a contribution of BRL93 million from acquisitions and BRL90 million from organic growth, which is comprised of the maturation of medical school seats and increase in the average ticket. UniRedentor contributed revenue of BRL64 million in the nine-month period, while Sao Lucas' contribution was BRL73 million, and PEBMED was close to BRL7 million.",Luis Andre Blanco,4393144
,,,,
15999,Presentation,"Luckily, there was also a BRL4 million benefit from the nonrecurrence discount granted due to COVID-19. On the right side of the page, we show nine-months 2020 adjusted EBITDA. During the period, adjusted EBITDA increased 77% year over year to BRL480 with 390 basis points expansion in the margins due in part to a BRL50 million contribution for UniRedentor, Sao Lucas, and PEBMED and BRL4 million contribution of mandatory discounts granted due to COVID-19. Excluding the contribution of these acquisitions, adjusted EBITDA advanced 54% to BRL356 million with BRL48 million contributed from acquisitions and BRL75 million from organic growth.",Luis Andre Blanco,4393144
,,,,
16000,Presentation,"The adjusted EBITDA margins excluding these three companies expanded 1,020 basis points. Moving next to a discussion of our cash flows on Slide 13. Cash and cash equivalents of BRL1.1 billion at the quarter end were 3% higher than the period and in the second quarter, reflecting the strong cash generation that we had in the quarter. The majority of this fund is invested in low-risk Brazilian reals denominated instruments.",Luis Andre Blanco,4393144
,,,,
16001,Presentation,"Total debt was BRL599 million at the quarter end 2020, up from BRL535 million at the end of second-quarter 2020 and BRL361 million at year-end 2019. The increase reflected the acquisition payables. Cash generation remained strong in the nine-month period, increasing 39% to BRL325 million, which resulted in a cash conversion of 86%, compared to the 109% in the same period of 2019. The decrease in cash conversion rate year over year is mainly due to the consolidation of Medcel business, our student renegotiations of overdue monthly installments due to COVID-19, and we saw a decrease in advances from our students.",Luis Andre Blanco,4393144
,,,,
16002,Presentation,"Turning next for a discussion about pro forma cash and debt on Slide 14. On this slide, we have upgraded our cash positions at the end of the third quarter to arrive at the pro forma level. This bridge takes in account the cash outflows for the five announced acquisitions since the second-quarter end, coupled with an increase in the bank debt to support our growth initiatives. All of these options have resulted in a pro forma cash position of BRL656 million, compared with BRL1.1 billion at the end of September.",Luis Andre Blanco,4393144
,,,,
16003,Presentation,"By contrast, our pro forma gross debt has increased to BRL1.3 billion from BRL599 million at the end of September. The increase reflected the increase of the bank debt that I just mentioned, coupled with the debt we had summoned with the acquisition of Ciencias Medicas. Turning next for a discussion about guidance on Slide 15. We are reaffirming our second-half 2020 guidance based on the solid performance in the third quarter.",Luis Andre Blanco,4393144
,,,,
16004,Presentation,"Our guidance takes in account the successfully concluded medical students intake for the second half of 2020. As a reminder, the world is still in the middle of a pandemic. Economics are slowly opening up and our guidance takes in account the best information available at this point of time. Two key metrics for the second-half 2020 guidance are as follows.",Luis Andre Blanco,4393144
,,,,
16005,Presentation,,Luis Andre Blanco,4393144
,,,,
16006,Presentation,"The second half net revenue is between BRL600 million and BRL640 million. Second-half 2020 adjusted EBITDA margins ranging between 45.5% and 47%, our guidance includes the impact of the adoption of IFRS 16, UniRedentor starting from February 2020, Sao Lucas from May 2020, and PEBMED from the late July and exclude other acquisitions that may be concluded after the issuance of this guidance. Additionally included in the revenue outlook is the revenue recognition for some medical classes that could not be held during the first half and were pushed out to the second-half 2020 upon the resumption of classes.",Luis Andre Blanco,4393144
,,,,
16007,Presentation,"This amounts to BRL40 million. Before opening the call to questions, let me finish by saying that we are pleased with our performance in the third quarter with the context of this challenging environment. I would like to thank you, every one of our employees emphatically for their continued hard work and resilience during these unusual times. We remain confident that our strategic investments are established as a solid foundation, creating further differentiation and positioning us from continued strong financial results that will drive long-term shareholder value creation.",Luis Andre Blanco,4393144
,,,,
16008,Presentation,"This ends our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take your questions. Operator, please open the lines for questions.",Luis Andre Blanco,4393144
,,,,
16009,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Marcelo Santos of JP Morgan. You may proceed with your question.,Operator,4393144
,,,,
16010,Question-and-Answer,"Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first is if you could provide some update on the intake for the medical unit in 2021. If we're being able to fill the seats and kind of ticket outlook you could discuss. And the second is about PEBMED integration and cross-sell initiatives. If you could provide us an update on how this is going and if you're ready -- about to launch some initiatives that could perhaps put together Medcel courses that matter. Anything in that sense would be very helpful. Thank you.",Marcelo Santos,4393144
,,,,
16011,Question-and-Answer,"Hi, Marcelo. Thank you for your question. I'll take the first question here then Julio will help me with the second answer here. So the intake for our medical seats for 2021 it's in very good trend. We are not expecting any kind of surprise and keeping the same trend to have 100% of occupancy of all seats, including the maturation and the new institutions acquired in 2020. So there will be no surprise on the intake side and also renewal for the following semester. On PEBMED, integration and cross-sell opportunities, Julio?",Virgilio Gibbon,4393144
,,,,
16012,Question-and-Answer,"Hey, Marcelo. Hello, everyone. I hope everyone is healthy and fine there. In regards to PEBMED, we started not integrating the Company yet, Marcelo, but we started with all the activities in terms of offering products to the different audiences.",Julio de Angeli,4393144
,,,,
16013,Question-and-Answer,"So Medcel has been promoting PEBMED and the other way around as well. So we just finalized, especially now the Black Friday period, which is important in terms of subscriptions for both business and enrollments. So we don't have yet concluded, but we've been doing integrated activities, commercial activities at this point. So far, I mean, PEBMED is now at a very, very different level.",Julio de Angeli,4393144
,,,,
16014,Question-and-Answer,"I mean, it's been growing, it's above 100,000, subscribers at this point, and Medcel has been doing quite well as well in the intake, where we started in September. So it's been growing above market levels as well. But so far, answering your questions, we are doing more of the commercial activities at this point. We have a couple of projects to be launched, especially with initiatives where we're going to add educational components to the offer.",Julio de Angeli,4393144
,,,,
16015,Question-and-Answer,And we are about actually to launch a specific marketplace where students will be able to have bundle offers from the different services and this is yet to come.,Julio de Angeli,4393144
,,,,
16016,Question-and-Answer,,Julio de Angeli,4393144
,,,,
16017,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. Our next question comes from Susana Salaru with Itau. You may proceed with your question.,Operator,4393144
,,,,
16018,Question-and-Answer,"Hi, guys, good morning. Thank you for taking our questions. We have two. First is related to the MedPhone and the WhiteBook. Are you guys going to maintain both lines? Or are you planning to unify and have a new combined product? That will be our first question. And the second question is related to the Medcel student base, which is -- which didn't evolve comparing to the previous quarter. What should we expect going forward? And if you are seeing a scenario that is different from what you had in your business plan for Medcel? That's it, guys. Thank you.",Susana Salaru,4393144
,,,,
16019,Question-and-Answer,"Hey, Susana, Julio here. So in regards to the first question, so far with MedPhone, I mean, we still want to keep the application up and running. And at this point, we are trying actually to convert the users from MedPhone to WhiteBook subscribers, so that's what we are doing now. In terms of the future, what -- the plan is actually we still need to keep both those applications just up and running and -- but the focus is to grow WhiteBook's user base.",Julio de Angeli,4393144
,,,,
16020,Question-and-Answer,"The other one about Medcel, again, answering your question, the student base actually declined a bit, but it's mostly because of the -- the cause is we had to deal with the pandemic. But the intake, as I mentioned on the previous answer to Marcelo, the intake, which is the most important for Q4 and for next year is doing well again, above the market growth level.",Julio de Angeli,4393144
,,,,
16021,Question-and-Answer,"Well, thank you, Julio. Just a follow-up on the Medcel student base. The cross-selling for the students -- for the last year students and the students that are before the last year students, is this happening? Or you are just -- the majority of the sales are happening just for the students that are graduating?",Susana Salaru,4393144
,,,,
16022,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. Well, the majority of the students, they are actually -- let me explain how this works. So the intake actually during this period of the year, September to December, most of them, the majority of them are still in the school. So they're still graduating, so they're finishing fifth year or the sixth year and the intake with doctors actually that are already physicians that are already graduated is higher after January, so January to March, April.",Julio de Angeli,4393144
,,,,
16023,Question-and-Answer,"So, so far now, it's more of students that are -- and this hasn't changed a lot. But what we see is that the market is growing and we're growing in the same pace, but more -- at this moment of the intake, it's more of the students that are still not graduated and it's just following the same pattern as other years.",Julio de Angeli,4393144
,,,,
16024,Question-and-Answer,Our next question comes from Fred Mendes with Bradesco. You may proceed with your question.,Operator,4393144
,,,,
16025,Question-and-Answer,"Hello, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for the call. I have two questions as well. The first one regarding the discounts that you recognized in this quarter. Just wondering if this is something that you already recognized. The mandatory discounts, right, that's something that you already recognized everything? Or should we expect to see more of these discounts as we move forward? This would be my first question. And then on the second question, I know as the state of the total revenue is not as much, but we saw a significant decrease in the number of students not related to healthcare course. So just wondering what can you expect from this business as we move forward? Thank you.",Fred Mendes,4393144
,,,,
16026,Question-and-Answer,"Thanks, Fred, it's Luis speaking. Regarding the mandatory discounts that we had on the third quarter, it's all that we got on the third quarter, okay? It's related to state decrees that requires us to give the discounts at this period and reflects the discount that at the first instance the judge has ruled us to give this discount. So we have this BRL3.9 million of discounts on the third quarter. Moving forward, we have some states laws that are still in place. So we will see at the fourth quarter, some discounts. I think this number should be around 1% to 2% of our net revenues, okay, this -- this amount.",Luis Andre Blanco,4393144
,,,,
16027,Question-and-Answer,,Luis Andre Blanco,4393144
,,,,
16028,Question-and-Answer,"Hi, Fred. Just to add a point here. This is Virgilio. So that will not put in risk the guidance, we are very comfort to reach the guidance for the second semester. On your second question about the nonmedical programs, we are closing many of them. That's one of the main reasons of the leverage in our operations, many of the programs from the institution acquired. They came with low margins of negative operational results, so we are closing these programs.",Virgilio Gibbon,4393144
,,,,
16029,Question-and-Answer,"And also we have seen the impact on COVID for the traditional on-campus undergrad program. So that's a combination of this, too. We are closing. We are very disciplined in closing programs that is not sustained in the long term. We are not going to challenge the competition or if there's distance learning and lowering our price. So we are just keeping on track the program that is sustainable and make the difference on the region that we have the operation.",Virgilio Gibbon,4393144
,,,,
16030,Question-and-Answer,"So it's expecting to dilute nonmedical programs on our penetration. Last year, if I'm not wrong, it's around 18% and this year it's around 14%. So also this is considered on our expectation for the entire year.",Virgilio Gibbon,4393144
,,,,
16031,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. Our next question comes from Mauricio Cepeda with Credit Suisse. You may proceed with your question.,Operator,4393144
,,,,
16032,Question-and-Answer,"Hello, guys. Thank you for the time, for the questions. I have two questions that are kind of specific. We noticed that the receivables for the quarter are still up versus last year. We'd like to know if this is a new level or if it's something that is contingent to COVID only? And also, we saw that the cash flow this quarter specifically was a little bit lower than last year's. So if you could give a little bit of more qualitative insight on this. We saw that it was something related to tax payables and advances from customers. But if you could give some more, let's say, rationale for what's happening. Thank you.",Mauricio Cepeda,4393144
,,,,
16033,Question-and-Answer,"Hi, Mauricio, it's Luis speaking. About the receivable base that we got on the third quarter, yes, it was a little bit higher than the days that we had on the third quarter last year, but it's lower than the one that we have presented on the second quarter. What's the difference between the years of it? What we got, there are three main reasons. The first one is the advances that we got from our students.",Luis Andre Blanco,4393144
,,,,
16034,Question-and-Answer,"If we compare this year with the 2019, the number of advances that we got from the students were lower, okay? So it's common that the students anticipate the payment of the semester to get a little bit of financial discounts on that. The second one is the installments that we -- the financial support that we provided to our students during this -- this pandemic. We have established the support through the installments to them instead of giving them discounts. So we were expecting a little bit of increase of our receivable days and that's the core.",Luis Andre Blanco,4393144
,,,,
16035,Question-and-Answer,"But it's already moving down as we reduce our receivable days from the third quarter if you compare that to the second-quarter 2020. And the third reason, if you compare with the 2019, it was Medcel. Medcel was incorporated with Afya during the second quarter last year and the Medcel business is the one that you recognize the revenue first on and then you got the receivables. So last year, we had recognized the revenue before Medcel was incorporated into Afya and we continue to get this cash on the second quarter, the third quarter last year.",Luis Andre Blanco,4393144
,,,,
16036,Question-and-Answer,"So this -- these are the three major factors giving more colors about this change on the receivables, okay?",Luis Andre Blanco,4393144
,,,,
16037,Question-and-Answer,[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Irma Sgarz with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question.,Operator,4393144
,,,,
16038,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. Hi, thank you for taking my question. One question, more technical, follow-up question. Your earlier remarks were very helpful. And from what I understand from all the answers, you're quite sort of comfortable, if I may say so, in terms of how underlying dynamics are shaking out, all things considered. In terms of dropouts, anything that you feel sort of additional that one is worth mentioning here and how you expect that to evolve from here and the ability to -- for early dropouts to reposition?",Irma Sgarz,4393144
,,,,
16039,Question-and-Answer,,Irma Sgarz,4393144
,,,,
16040,Question-and-Answer,"You're speaking to 100% occupancy, so I assume that's sort of baked into there. But anything additional that you feel worth mentioning would be helpful. And then just as you look sort of beyond the near-term and into the medium-term, just sort of from an M&A perspective, to the extent that you can speak to it. Sort of what incremental are you looking for -- incremental new characteristics from a regional perspective or from a quality perspective or any other aspects of variables that you're taking into consideration as you look through at incremental sort of last bit of M&A targets? And third question is just a quick update on the approval process for the remaining Mais Medicos' two campuses. Any update there you can provide? Thank you.",Irma Sgarz,4393144
,,,,
16041,Question-and-Answer,"Hi, Irma, this is Virgilio. I got your first and the third question about Mais Medicos. About the dropouts, before renewing all students for the second semester, we are expecting to see a higher dropout, but when we finished the reenrollment, we didn't see that. The renewal rates was the same pattern that we had previous year and we will start renewal on January because you have a very long second semester because of the COVID and we are not expecting as we -- any problem in the renew and keeping the 100% of occupancy of the students. It's worth to mention that demand is keeping a very high level.",Virgilio Gibbon,4393144
,,,,
16042,Question-and-Answer,"So the candidates perceive it's very healthy and we are still in the beginning of the classes. But I think, it will be no surprised in terms of student pay for medical students in the first half of 2021. On other programs, ex medicine, will be tough, we are seeing dropouts, lower intake, the competition of distance learning doesn't make any sense for us. So we will keep very discipline in closing programs that doesn't make sense in terms of sustainability for operations and improving our penetration of closing -- getting close to 90% of our BU1 revenues coming from medical program, okay?",Virgilio Gibbon,4393144
,,,,
16043,Question-and-Answer,"On the Mais Medicos side, we already had the first intake for Santa Ines. That was our first license authorized. And we are expecting a very short term, maybe in weeks to have the second approval for another institution on North region. For the others, we still have five to get the final authorization and expect to be two by the end of first 2021 and the other three by the end of next year.",Virgilio Gibbon,4393144
,,,,
16044,Question-and-Answer,"Irma, it's Luis. I'm going to take the questions regarding M&A. Talking about the M&A opportunities that we have on the BU1 first. We are very close to reach the 1,000 seat goals that we have established on the IPO. We have a very fertile pipeline. We have some views that are in our hot pipeline. So we can get -- reach this 1,000 seat goals in the short term. Moving forward though on BU1, I think we're going to be more strategic on our movements.",Luis Andre Blanco,4393144
,,,,
16045,Question-and-Answer,"We are -- we are keeping our disciplines on -- just focus the units that had more than 6% of their revenues on the maturation that comes from the medicine business -- from the medicine part of the business and we established our minimal IRR in those acquisitions. So we continue to see opportunities and we're going to keep our discipline on that. Regarding BU2, we -- first of all, it's important to remember that we are between signing and closing of iClinic. We're supposed to get the iClinic closing in the very, very beginning of January. And we are discussing with the Bruno of PEBMED and with Julio, the opportunities that we have to keep going on the health tech business.",Luis Andre Blanco,4393144
,,,,
16046,Question-and-Answer,"We have this view that we have to repower the physicians. We want that the physicians have the access to the best tools for them to get the best outcome, to give them the best efficiency, to increase their productivities, and we want them to provide the tools that give them flexibility, mobility on their day-by-day business so they can focus on patients. We have mapped the market on this health tech, on these functionalities and we are working together to see the next movement, to plug them in this future environment that we are building to provide this to empower of the physicians. So, we are very excited for the opportunities that we have in the M&A in both business units.",Luis Andre Blanco,4393144

16047,Question-and-Answer,,Luis Andre Blanco,4393144

We will then be happy to take some questions. We are pleased with our strong performance in second quarter fiscal 2021, which reflects the tireless efforts of our associates around the world and the strength and resilience of our global platform.",Iv Culp,4393139
,,,,
16061,Presentation,"As we continue to navigate our way through these uncertain times.

We are incredibly proud of our team's continued drive to deliver innovative products and satisfy the evolving needs of our customers while also integrating enhanced safety practices and new ways of working virtually throughout our business.",Iv Culp,4393139
,,,,
16062,Presentation,"Overall, we are very pleased with the top line performance for both our mattress fabrics and the Upholstery Fabrics segment. Its faster than expected recovery indicates an increased consumer focus on the home environment, as well as our ability to service this increase in demand with our strong global platform in stable supply chain. We are also benefiting from market share gains as our innovative products are resonating well with both new and existing customers.",Iv Culp,4393139
,,,,
16063,Presentation,,Iv Culp,4393139
,,,,
16064,Presentation,"Additionally, we delivered significant sequential improvement in operating income as compared to the first quarter consistent with our expectations. We further strengthened our balance sheet with increased liquidity, its total cash and investments reached $56.5 million. Based on the strong financial performance and excellent cash flow for the first half of the year, we are pleased to announce that our Board of Directors approved a 5% increase in our quarterly dividend marking the eighth consecutive year of increase.",Iv Culp,4393139
,,,,
16065,Presentation,"This is consistent with our capital allocation strategy and our commitment to generate value for our shareholders. We also expect to continue investing in working capital and planned capital expenditures during the second half of the year. Additionally, we have decided to maintain the suspension of our share repurchase plan at this time. These strategic decisions are based on our disciplined approach to capital allocation and subscribed in our capital allocation strategy, which is posted on our website.",Iv Culp,4393139
,,,,
16066,Presentation,"The ongoing uncertainty relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, including a recent surge in cases and governmental considerations for new shutdown measures it's certainly a factor we're taking into consideration with respect to capital utilization. But we are also working to remain strategically positioned during the current environment. Our current approach to capital allocation is conservative in terms of managing short-term COVID-19 uncertainty.",Iv Culp,4393139
,,,,
16067,Presentation,"But we also believe it is appropriately aggressive and allows us to be opportunistic on growth opportunities that may present themselves, both organically and otherwise. As always, this is a strategy we evaluate continually based on current facts and circumstances. Looking ahead, our customers? ability to meet their demand is being challenged by - supply chain constraints related primarily to non-fabric components, as well as some labor shortages, which could temporarily delay their scheduled delivery of fabric orders from - our divisions.",Iv Culp,4393139
,,,,
16068,Presentation,"Additionally, the ongoing impact in duration of the COVID-19 pandemic remains unknown. We are prepared for a range of macroeconomic scenarios and we are confident in our ability to weather these near-term headwinds.

,,,,
16071,Presentation,Thanks Iv.,Ken Bowling,4393139
,,,,
16072,Presentation,"As mentioned earlier on the call, we have posted slide presentations to our Investor Relations website that cover key performance measures. We've also posted our capital allocation strategy. I also want to note that as a result of the sale of eLuxury during the fourth quarter of last year, the financial result for the Home Accessories segment are excluded from the reported financial performance of our continuing operations and presented as a discontinued operation in our consolidated financial statements.",Ken Bowling,4393139
,,,,
16073,Presentation,"Here are the financial highlights for the second quarter. Net sales were $76.9 million up 10.5% compared with the prior year period. Both divisions had a strong sales performance for the quarter, Iv will go into more detail on divisional operation performance in a moment. On a pretax basis, the company reported income from continuing operations of $3.9 million, which included $680,000 other expenses related mostly to foreign exchange rate fluctuations associated with our operations in China.",Ken Bowling,4393139
,,,,
16074,Presentation,"This compared with pretax income from continuing operations of $4.5 million for the second quarter of last year, which included only $99,000 in other expense. The current quarter was affected by the unstable foreign exchange rate fluctuations I just mentioned, as well as higher SG&A expense due primarily to higher crude incentive compensation expense, offset somewhat by lower T&E and marketing expenses.",Ken Bowling,4393139
,,,,
16075,Presentation,,Ken Bowling,4393139
,,,,
16076,Presentation,"On a percent of sales basis total SG&A came in at 12.7% compared to 13.1% for the same period a year ago.

,,,,
16077,Presentation,"The effective income tax rate for the second quarter of this fiscal year was 41.4%, compared with 50.1% in the same period a year ago. The effective income tax rate is affected over the fiscal year by the mix and timing of actual earnings from our U.S. operations and foreign subsidiaries located in China, Canada, which have higher income tax rate as compared to the U.S. Federal rate.",Ken Bowling,4393139
,,,,
16078,Presentation,"Looking ahead to the rest of this fiscal year, we estimate that our consolidated effective income tax - rate for the third and fourth quarters of this fiscal year will be in the range of 40% to 50% based on the facts we know today. Trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA as of the end of the second quarter of this fiscal year was $11.5 million or 4.5% of sales.",Ken Bowling,4393139
,,,,
16079,Presentation,"Now let?s take a look at our two business segments. For the Mattress Fabrics segment sales were $40 million up 12.2% compared to last year?s second quarter. Operating income for the quarter was $4.4 million compared with $3.3 million a year ago, with an operating income margin of 10.9% compared with 9.2% a year ago. Our improved operating performance for the second quarter primarily reflects the benefit from fixed cost absorption and higher sales and improved operating efficiencies resulting from fully maximizing our production capacity.",Ken Bowling,4393139
,,,,
16080,Presentation,"For the Upholstery Fabrics segment, sales for the second quarter were $36.8 million up 8.7% over the prior year. Operating income for the quarter was $3.3 million compared with $3.5 million a year ago, with an operating income margin of 8.9% compared with 10.2% a year ago. Operating performance was materially affected by unfavorable China foreign exchange rate fluctuations, as well as some impacts in sales mix, offset somewhat by lower spending on T&E and marketing expenses.",Ken Bowling,4393139
,,,,
16081,Presentation,"Here are the balance sheet highlights, we reported $56.5 million in total cash and investments and no outstanding borrowings ever been in the quarter, up from our $38.7 million net cash position as of the end of last fiscal year. For the first six months of this fiscal year, we incurred $2 million of capital expenditures and spent $2.6 million on regular quarterly dividends. Cash flow from operations and free cash flow were $22.7 million and $20.5 million respectively.",Ken Bowling,4393139
,,,,
16082,Presentation,For the first six months of the year compared with cash flow from operations and free cash flow of $8.2 million and $5.6 million respectively for the prior year period. This year-over-year improvement reflects the focus attention on working capital management during the first half of the year. While we're extremely pleased with our strong cash position and fortified balance sheet going into the second half of the year.,Ken Bowling,4393139
,,,,
16083,Presentation,"It is important to note that our cash position will be affected by our strategic investments and working capital and planned capital expenditures during this period. The company did not repurchase any shares in second quarter, leaving the full $5 million available under the share repurchase program approved by the Board in March 2020. As previously disclosed, the company temporarily suspended the share repurchase program during the fourth quarter of last fiscal year given the economic uncertainty related to COVID-19.",Ken Bowling,4393139
,,,,
16084,Presentation,"With that, I'll turn the call back over to Iv.",Ken Bowling,4393139
,,,,
16085,Presentation,Thanks Ken.,Iv Culp,4393139
,,,,
16086,Presentation,Let me start with the Mattress Fabrics business. We were especially encouraged by the strong growth and sales and operating income for the Mattress Fabrics segment during the second quarter. We built on the momentum generated during the last eight weeks of the first quarter by utilizing our product driven strategy for both mattress fabrics and sewn covers as well as our global supply chain and dedicated attention to our customers.,Iv Culp,4393139
,,,,
16087,Presentation,,Iv Culp,4393139
,,,,
16088,Presentation,"The strength and flexibility of our global manufacturing and sourcing operations in the United States, Canada, Haiti, Asia and Turkey enabled us to support current demand and serve the need for our mattress fabrics and cover sewn matters fabric and cover customers. We are also pleased with the continued growth of our sewn mattress cover business with demand trend for mattress cover now exceeding pre COVID levels.",Iv Culp,4393139
,,,,
16089,Presentation,"This trend is driven by the ongoing growth in the boxed bedding space and we continue to work collaboratively with new and existing customers to develop fresh and innovative products. Our sewn cover production capabilities in U.S., Haiti and Asia align with our vertical ability to provide innovative product offerings from fabric to sewn cover provide us with a strategic integrated advantage in supporting the rapidly changing demands of our customers.",Iv Culp,4393139
,,,,
16090,Presentation,"Additionally, our building expansion in Haiti was completed during the second quarter, providing additional capacity and enhancing our ability to produce sewn covers. We're also excited about ongoing developments and product innovation, including expanding our specialty finish options to include features for sustainability anti-microbial protection and other wellness related properties.",Iv Culp,4393139
,,,,
16091,Presentation,"We also remain pleased with the continued opportunities for innovation through our Re.Imagine Culp Home Fashions, our 3D rendering services, which have allowed us to continue showcasing our products and support our customers through virtual, design collaboration in the face of travel limitation. Our virtual design and search began before the pandemic and since that time, these capabilities have strengthened our position with customers.",Iv Culp,4393139
,,,,
16092,Presentation,We expect that our increased fabric capacity in North America resulting from our investment in additional equipment will be available in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. We also believe that domestic mattress industry and in turn our business will benefit from the recent preliminary anti-dumping duties imposed by the U.S. Department of Commerce on mattress imports from seven countries.,Iv Culp,4393139
,,,,
16093,Presentation,"Additionally, despite these ongoing uncertainty relating to the pandemic, we have continued to focus on our commitment to environmental sustainability. We have now achieved landfill-free status in both of our U.S. manufacturing facilities which reflects our ongoing effort to promote sustainable production across our operations.",Iv Culp,4393139
,,,,
16094,Presentation,"Barring additional shutdowns or significant disruption in our customers supply chain for raw material other than fabric, we believe we are well positioned in mattress fabrics to execute our strategy and increase market share during the second half of fiscal 2021.",Iv Culp,4393139
,,,,
16095,Presentation,"Now let me turn some attention to the Upholstery Fabrics segment. We were also very pleased with the solid growth in our upholstery fabrics business for the second quarter. Our residential upholstery business saw a significant increase in sales compared to the prior-year period, driven primarily by the increased consumer focus on the at-home experience and overall comfort.",Iv Culp,4393139
,,,,
16096,Presentation,"Through our strong platform in Asia, including our expanded cut and sew capabilities in Vietnam and our stable, long-term supplier relationships, we were able to respond quickly to meet the upsurge in demand from our customers and increase our market share. We have also generated historically strong backlog in our residential upholstery business, reflecting the ongoing favorable demand trends for this business.",Iv Culp,4393139
,,,,
16097,Presentation,"Our line of highly durable, stain-resistant LiveSmart performance fabrics, as well as our line of LiveSmart Evolve performance plus sustainability fabrics, continued to experience favorable demand trends.

,,,,
16098,Presentation,,Iv Culp,4393139
,,,,
16099,Presentation,"We are focused on promoting these product lines and building our strong brand performance products under our LiveSmart umbrella. These LiveSmart performance fabrics are important drivers of our residential growth. Our hospitality business remained under pressure by the ongoing COVID-19 disruption that continued to affect the travel and leisure industries. These lingering pressures also affected Read Window Products, our window treatment and installation business, during the quarter.",Iv Culp,4393139
,,,,
16100,Presentation,"While sales for our hospitality business remained relatively stable as compared in the first quarter, we expect that the disruption in hospitality and leisure will continue to affect this business in the near-term. Additionally, while we saw solid sequential improvement in our operating income as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2021, our second quarter results compared to the prior-year period were materially affected by unfavorable China exchange rate fluctuations, as well as some impact from sales mix.",Iv Culp,4393139
,,,,
16101,Presentation,"We expect these factors will continue to affect our operating income during the third quarter. Despite these pressures, we were encouraged by our solid operating margin in the second quarter. We are encouraged by the historically strong backlog in our residential upholstery business and are confident in our ability to meet this demand. We expect the strong performance in our residential upholstery business to continue, absent any additional pandemic-related shutdowns or material disruption to our customers? supply chain.",Iv Culp,4393139
,,,,
16102,Presentation,Ken will now discuss the general outlook for the third and fourth quarter for this fiscal year and we will then take some questions.,Iv Culp,4393139
,,,,
16103,Presentation,"At this time, due to the continued economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the lack of visibility as to this duration or ultimate impact, we are providing only limited financial guidance for fiscal 2021. Although subject to unforeseen changes that may arise in connection with the pandemic. We are encouraged by the ongoing execution of our product-driven strategy and continued strength in demand for home furnishing products, as well as our opportunities for market share growth.",Ken Bowling,4393139
,,,,
16104,Presentation,"Considering each factors we expects sales and operating income for the third quarter of this fiscal year to be comparable to the prior-year period, with the Mattress Fabrics segment continuing its strong year-over-year rebound and the Upholstery Fabrics segment facing ongoing headwinds relating to foreign exchange rate fluctuations associated with its operations located in China, customer supply chain constraints, and sales mix.",Ken Bowling,4393139
,,,,
16105,Presentation,"We also expects sales and operating income for the fourth quarter of this fiscal year to be dramatically improved for both segments as compared to the fourth quarter of last fiscal year. Based on current expectations, including the $4 million investment in additional knit machines for our Mattress Fabrics segment that we mentioned last quarter, capital expenditures for this fiscal year are now expected to be in the $8.5 million to $9 million range. Depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $7 million for this fiscal year.",Ken Bowling,4393139
,,,,
16106,Presentation,"With that, we will now take your questions.",Ken Bowling,4393139
,,,,
16107,Question-and-Answer,[Operator Instructions] And our first question is Bobby Griffin with Raymond James. Please go ahead.,Operator,4393139
,,,,
16108,Question-and-Answer,"So, I guess first I want to talk about just before commentary here. So good momentum here in mattress you referenced and I think in the prepared remarks and a very good backlog and a pull through record level backlog. So maybe just help me connect the dots between when that type of momentum and then maybe in the sales commentary have been roughly comparable year-over-year?",Bobby Griffin,4393139
,,,,
16109,Question-and-Answer,So is there a timing issue or is the currency hurting the top-line or is there anything else there that might be driving that or just general conservative - or just some conservatism in the guidance?,Bobby Griffin,4393139
,,,,
16110,Question-and-Answer,,Bobby Griffin,4393139
,,,,
16111,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, thank you Bobby good question. And thanks for asking that and I'll give you a commentary. I'll break it down by division, if that's okay, and then Ken you certainly can chime in to. On the mattress fabrics side, you just have to remember there is some seasonality in our Q3, being and generally a normally weaker quarter, with our holiday shutdowns really across all locations. We have that in U.S., Canada and also in Haiti.",Iv Culp,4393139
,,,,
16112,Question-and-Answer,"And what I yes I would point you to for Q3 as in the mattress fabrics side is significantly improved year-over-year, which we're very happy with. On the upholstery side, the residential backlog, the rise does remain historically high. There are some headwinds for that business like currently, and really more so maybe for the sales on our customers supply chains, which I would say for that business, if your materials and capacity for our customers improve, then there's certainly some upside for that business.",Iv Culp,4393139
,,,,
16113,Question-and-Answer,"Generally for both businesses, a little bit of capacity and raw material cleaning up for both sides of the business to get a little better at our customer side, we could ship them more fabric that we have prepared. So that is an upside to the Q3 that could be there. Ken feel free to add to that if0 you'd like.",Iv Culp,4393139
,,,,
16114,Question-and-Answer,"No, I think you covered it all, I think the key there is the year-over-year improvement that we're looking at and the seasonality part of it and of course on the upholstery side, the headwinds that we'll continue to have to face - those are factors.",Ken Bowling,4393139
,,,,
16115,Question-and-Answer,"And it's generally a story Bobby of third quarter mattress fabrics, is continuing to rebound very well in upholstery we are just being a bit cautious in some of the headwinds uncertainty.",Iv Culp,4393139
,,,,
16116,Question-and-Answer,"Okay, okay, that's helpful. And then when we look at, you look at the business and how you guys have ramped back up production stuff. I mean where is efficiency verse historical levels within mattresses is throughput getting back close to normal from your side, taking the other industry supply chains out. But it seems like the supply chains, more non-fabric related issues, and then on your products.",Bobby Griffin,4393139
,,,,
16117,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, if you think back on the mattress side, really over the last couple of years, we did some significant capital expenditure work, to really build a world-class platform, both in the U.S. and in Canada that gets complemented by our really strategic global options Haiti, Asia, and Turkey. So, we're really pleased with that platform. And the more volume we run through it, the better that will perform.",Iv Culp,4393139
,,,,
16118,Question-and-Answer,We have built a platform that will thrive efficiently with volume. And so - to see the sales start to rebound. And our expectation is that we?ll keep going that does help us quite a bit with our efficiency in the mattress fabrics side.,Iv Culp,4393139
,,,,
16119,Question-and-Answer,Okay. And has anything been done. Have you guys passed any price yet related to the currency changes happening in China or is that still? Maybe going forward you'd have to make some adjustments?,Bobby Griffin,4393139
,,,,
16120,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, I'll let Boyd speak to that. And I'll just tee it up a little bit. Over time we have shown as these currency impacts, in this case primarily related to the China foreign exchange rates. For sure we do our best to adjust our costs and things within China to offset some of that. But if there are continued pressures, then we do have to adjust our prices and we always have business to do that. And Boyd you may speak to your timeline how are you thinking about that?",Iv Culp,4393139
,,,,
16121,Question-and-Answer,"Yes no, that's exactly right Iv and you know always currency is a consideration in our business. And when we see periods where there is a more significant and more rapid movement, and yes, we always monitor that and take necessary actions when appropriate. So, we're evaluating all that right now. And price considerations and adjustments were one of the things that we will be considering.",Boyd Chumbley,4393139
,,,,
16122,Question-and-Answer,,Boyd Chumbley,4393139
,,,,
16123,Question-and-Answer,[Operator Instructions] Our next question is Marco Rodriguez with Stonegate Capital Markets. Please go ahead.,Operator,4393139
,,,,
16124,Question-and-Answer,"I want to do a follow-up on one of the prior question there in regard to I guess, the guidance as it relates to mattress fabrics, specifically here first, and the seasonality. Just kind of want to get your guys thoughts on, if you can, what sort of or perhaps demand you saw perhaps pull forward from quarters that come or was this maybe kind of the pent-up demand that nobody was shopping during the shutdowns and how that impacted kind of the above expectation, revenue growth you saw in Q2?",Marco Rodriguez,4393139
,,,,
16125,Question-and-Answer,"And then if you can kind of layer in, historically, the Q3/Q2 seasonality has been down about two or 3%. But what kind of all of the names as working already for me you can provide a little more color on how you guys are thinking about that, and how we should think about that?",Marco Rodriguez,4393139
,,,,
16126,Question-and-Answer,"Okay - let me start my presence here. And I'll let Ken finish it off with a little bit of thought towards how we think about look forward. But just think about the mattress fabrics segment and we do have, we have significant tailwinds in that business. Some that you are touching on that have already happened, and some that we see might be coming. And so for certain, the faster than expected recovery, for the business at the sales level is no doubt impacted by a strong home focus that was generated by COVID-19.",Iv Culp,4393139
,,,,
16127,Question-and-Answer,"So that gives us just a focus on home environment, updating - upgrading your comfort values, whether it will be furniture or mattresses. There's certainly a focus on health. People want a healthier more well night sleep. But on top of that, there's a lot in anti-dumping is a tailwind that could come we're optimistic that will come and make a difference. But on top of that, there's going forward headwinds throughout that we're excited about through our innovation, some of the things we've done there that are really unique in the product side of our fabric and sewn cover. And we are getting market share.",Iv Culp,4393139
,,,,
16128,Question-and-Answer,"We're winning market share gains protected for calendar year 2021. And we have new capacity in both fabric formation and in Haiti, for fabric and sewn covers that we think will make a difference. So there is tailwinds that have lifted kind of a rising tide has lifted all boats with the pandemic. So we're really confident in our market share gains in our product driven strategy to carry this forward past Q3 fall into next year. Ken, so if you want to give any context to how you're thinking about guidance for Q3 Marco you may want more details around that, but that's - so I'm thinking about the general lift of market share and general tailwind trends.",Iv Culp,4393139
,,,,
16129,Question-and-Answer,"Yes Marco, this is Ken. I think when you look at - as we look at the past couple quarters, we've had that sequential improvement from the lows back in the first quarter to now I mean as we pivot toward the second half the year, it's more of a year-over-year. And so, when we look at of course, the seasonality for mattress fabrics is an issue. But when we look at the seasonality part of, that's the reason why that sequential growth just doesn't keep going.",Ken Bowling,4393139
,,,,
16130,Question-and-Answer,"But that said the year-over-year impact that we're looking at is going to be significant. And so, we're very encouraged about that. And then of course for both businesses, as we look to the fourth quarter, we're excited to see that continued business level, going into the fourth quarter. And of course, compared to a very rough quarter last year, we see dramatic improvements on both sides.",Ken Bowling,4393139
,,,,
16131,Question-and-Answer,"So it's a - it's definitely a year-over-year pivot situation. But obviously to continue performance as we take what we've got, and we continue to have performances in second half of the year.",Ken Bowling,4393139
,,,,
16132,Question-and-Answer,,Marco Rodriguez,4393139
,,,,
16133,Question-and-Answer,"And then in terms of your market share gains, you can talk about mattress fabrics here for a minute. Can you maybe talk a little bit about what sort of feedback or color you're getting from the customer that to why your - why you are increasing that market share versus competitors and what sort of the main drivers behind that?",Marco Rodriguez,4393139
,,,,
16134,Question-and-Answer,"Yes sure, Marco thank you, good question. There is two things I see first, we have for some time and we're working on this well before any COVID-19 pandemic issues a dedicated product driven strategy and we put a lot of emphasis into innovation, from fabric to finish cover. So we really believe we have a preferred model of designing innovative fabrics and then, now being able to take them into the growing bed in the box space to finish cover that's an advantage.",Iv Culp,4393139
,,,,
16135,Question-and-Answer,"And if you layer that product focus on top of a very robust global supply chain, and especially in mattress covers with North American platform, capital of Haiti, and then backed up really strong with Culp China, just as a winning strategy. So I think its design and service really are two factors driving us into new places. And I guess what we're excited about market share it's really across the board.",Iv Culp,4393139
,,,,
16136,Question-and-Answer,So it's new exciting that in the box space that everyone is intrigued by. But we're also having some games with our legacy business we call it for new product lines that will roll out in calendar year 2021.,Iv Culp,4393139
,,,,
16137,Question-and-Answer,"And then in terms of the gross margin pickup that you saw here in Q2, obviously the volumes helped quite a bit the efficiency that you've also put into the system is also great. I'm just wondering if you can maybe comment on those capital investments you have made the additional capacity you have, and the potential new volumes that should come through that business in the next - in the next year. Have you bought share to reset the operating margin performance to where maybe you're above that low 20% gross margin that you saw before all the anti-dumping issues were around in 2019 and 2020?",Marco Rodriguez,4393139
,,,,
16138,Question-and-Answer,"Yes Marco, let me I?ll start and Iv you can jump in. I think Iv touched on this a little bit ago, given the - all the improvements that we've made over the years. I mean, that's really set us up for being able to take advantage of this increase in sales. I mean, the structural changes that we made moving certain products to different locations, and getting to be able to take maximum, it?s been able to maximize that move. I mean, that has certainly helped.",Ken Bowling,4393139
,,,,
16139,Question-and-Answer,"So I think as we - obviously as we look forward, that was definitely a factor in the second quarter. But as we look forward, those are going to be - contribute to the improvement in the third and fourth quarter beyond. Now, as far as I don't remember the second part of that question as far as where is the gross margin, but I mean that, to me what I've just described is really - where we are at today and all the improvements we've made. So Iv I don't know, you want to add anything to that or?",Ken Bowling,4393139
,,,,
16140,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, we did that we said last quarter we announced a $4 million additional capital expenditure on fabric forming equipment fixed for North America. That's an addition to our Haiti expansion that we had done and got completed in second quarter. So and then we're making a nod in our capital allocation strategies it is making sure to keep our opportunities available for further organic expansion. Because we just do see some opportunities come on.",Iv Culp,4393139
,,,,
16141,Question-and-Answer,"And I guess so for sure, the more volume we put to our platform, there is margin opportunity to improve it. Ken, I definitely want to talk about what that is and?.",Iv Culp,4393139
,,,,
16142,Question-and-Answer,Yes.,Ken Bowling,4393139
,,,,
16143,Question-and-Answer,There is opportunity to improve.,Iv Culp,4393139
,,,,
16144,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, I think to one other point related to our - the $4 million investment that we talked about, I mean, that certainly will give us the increased capacity, but that also gives us the flexibility to trade out old equipment for new, more efficient equipment. It gives us the flexibility to ramp production up and down. And so, all that is a part of our strategic effort to be more nimble, more B2B, be ready for anything that customer can provide or give us as far as demand.",Ken Bowling,4393139
,,,,
16145,Question-and-Answer,,Ken Bowling,4393139
,,,,
16146,Question-and-Answer,"So all those come into play, and again - all the efficiency movements that we've made, the investment that we're going to make, all those will contribute in the future.",Ken Bowling,4393139
,,,,
16147,Question-and-Answer,"Understood, and if I can squeeze one more question in just real quick on the upholstery fabrics side the supply constraints outside of the fabrics. When speaking to your customers, do you have any sort of sense as far as what they're thinking timeframe lines, where they will kind of be past that those supply constraints, and back to a more normalized environment, if you will?",Marco Rodriguez,4393139
,,,,
16148,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, Macro and this is Boyd. There is progress being made, I think throughout the industry. There are just wins to capacity that are taking place to meet this significantly higher level of demand. And there's a lot of that underway, and I think progress is being made, is probably going to take another quarter or so to fully see the impacts of new capacity coming on stream. I think part of the difficult things, are both the constraints and staffing and hiring and training.",Boyd Chumbley,4393139
,,,,
16149,Question-and-Answer,"But also, there has been some constraints on the component supply side, such as phone. So that's another issue that's kind of held back some of the throughput. And that probably is going to carry forward a bit during this current quarter. So I think we're going to see some steady improvement in that regard. We certainly hear that from our customers that capacity, more capacity is coming on stream.",Boyd Chumbley,4393139
,,,,
16150,Question-and-Answer,"So it's just going to take a little more time. But I think, we'll look at another quarter, and then probably see, certainly in fourth quarter, much more improvement in that regard.",Boyd Chumbley,4393139
,,,,
16151,Question-and-Answer,[Operator Instructions] And there are no further questions at this time.,Operator,4393139

,,,,
16158,Presentation,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I am thrilled with the strong results we reported this morning and what our team has accomplished thus far this year. This was another record breaking quarter with comparable sales increasing 17.8% and EPS of $0.76 representing our highest ever third quarter adjusted earnings far exceeding last year's comparable figure. Our consistently outstanding results throughout the COVID crisis are tributes to the exceptional and unwavering teamwork across the entire organization.",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16159,Presentation,"Once again, I want to thank our associates in our stores, the distribution centers and our corporate headquarters for their dedication and tireless efforts. As many of you probably know, we made the decision this year to close our stores at 1:00 P.M. on Thanksgiving Day to make certain our associates had as much time with family as possible in this atypical year. ",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16160,Presentation,"While our stores are typically open throughout Thanksgiving, we were happy to provide our teams with the opportunity to be with their families, while also offering our customers a desirable window to shop for last minute needs. The guiding principles we have used to navigate what remain uncertain times include the key priority of making our stores and workplaces as safe as possible.",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16161,Presentation,"We remain steadfast in that objective as we once again see COVID cases rapidly increasing. Along with clear and rigorous safety standards, social distancing, and cleaning protocols in all of our stores and workplaces our investment in new e-com and omni-channel capabilities, such as curbside pickup and same day delivery are a critical part of these efforts.",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16162,Presentation,"Over the past quarter, we have seen continued momentum from the COVID induced nesting trend, but the strength of our business also reflects the strategies that we're already rolling out under operation Northstar. These include our Broyhill launch, the introduction across 750 stores of the lot and queue line initiatives and our pantry optimization reset. All of these initiatives have been successful, and along with our growing e-com capabilities, and expanding customer file, position us for continued strong progress going forward.",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16163,Presentation,"As I mentioned in our last call, and the current way of living, our assortment of everyday essentials and stay at home products continues to strongly align with customers wants and needs.

,,,,
16166,Presentation,"We are confident that we are well-positioned to gain market share from both existing customers and those who are new to the Big Lots family. On top of all that, during this year's unique holiday selling season, we have positioned our assortment and promotional cadence to capture early holiday shopping.",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16167,Presentation,"So, let me give you an update on where we stand to date and frame for you how we've planned the business for the balance of the quarter as we look to manage the key selling weeks leading up to and including Christmas. Our strategic decision to plan for early holiday shopping has paid off as our quarter-to-date comps are up low double digits with strong sell through in seasonal merchandise.",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16168,Presentation,"Given a pull forward in sales and elongated holiday shopping season, we have planned for the business to moderate for the balance of the quarter. Overall, our strategies reflect the fact that now more than ever, customers are demanding expanded ways to shop how and when and where they want. We continue to accelerate our omni-channel capabilities, removing purchase friction, and creating better customer experiences.",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16169,Presentation,"As you know, this year we introduced curbside pickup, as well as same day delivery in partnership with Instacart. In July, we launched same day delivery from biglots.com with PICKUP our same day delivery partner, allowing customers to order any item available at their local Big Lots store via biglots.com, delivering small and large items from decorative accessories and snacks to furniture and mattresses, all within the same day. Our Instacart and PICKUP delivery services accelerated over the quarter, making a significant contribution to our overall e-commerce driven growth.",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16170,Presentation,"And finally, we have now rolled out ship from store capabilities to 47 initial stores strategically identified to ensure two day delivery to 90% of our customers across the country. For a cohesive experience online and in-store, we have integrated web and store capabilities to allow for seamless returns, pricing, consistency, and order visibility. I'm also proud to highlight that we are named number one in total retails 2020 top omni-channel retailers report. This achievement is validation of how quickly we have adapted our approach to meet our customers evolving needs.",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16171,Presentation,"We still have a long way to go on our omni-channel journey, but I'm delighted with the progress we have made and the accelerated rollout we have achieved over the past nine months. In total e-com and omni-channel demand grew 70% over Q3 last year, contributing close to 170 basis points to the overall company comp, driven by an expanded SKU offering, convenient delivery options, and new digital customer acquisition. Nearly every KPI in this business continues to trend favorably, with notable improvements in site traffic, conversion rates, penetration of sales, and delivery times.",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16172,Presentation,"Let me now spend a few moments on the excellent trajectory we are seeing in Broyhill. As I mentioned on our last call, we added talent to the organization and have begun to expand and update our Broyhill fall and holiday assortments to include products like area rugs, bed sheets, and decorative pillows. The customer reaction to the entire offering of this iconic brand remains very favorable. And we remain very excited about our 2021 extension of Broyhill into housewares and kitchen textiles.",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16173,Presentation,,Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16174,Presentation,Broyhill is now on track to generate close to 400 million in first year sales and we continue to firmly believe it can be a billion dollar brand for Big Lots over time. Broyhill customers spent twice as much as non- Broyhill customers and 10 times as much as non furniture customers. This dynamic is driven both by basket size and visit frequency. One third of Broyhill customers are new to Big Lots and 50% of Broyhill customers have already returned to make a second purchase either in-stores or through biglots.com.,Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16175,Presentation,"We also continue and make excellent progress on this year's rollout of the Lot and Queue Line. We have rolled these strategies out to approximately 750 stores, which are performing well and in-line with expectations. The Lot lift stores 1 to 2 comp points and also provides a great way for us to test new merchandise categories anchored in theme presentations, such as outdoor sporting goods, novelty kitchen appliances, and apparel.",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16176,Presentation,"We continue to see strength in apparel in the Lot, but also in small appliances and in toys. The Queue line drives approximately 1 point of comp and the configuration in the front of the store frees up space for other assortments, including quality closeouts. As I noted on our last call, in the near term, we will continue prioritizing the rollout of the Lot and the Queue line, given the high returns associated with these initiatives and expect to add another 450 stores by the end of Q1 2021.",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16177,Presentation,"Pantry optimization launched this past quarter, and the rollout was complete at the end of September. As a reminder, this involves repositioning footage from food staples, to food entertainment and consumables, including cleaning products and health and beauty. We're combining competitively priced national brands with an expanded assortment of close outs, all of which creates a significant value differentiation from the competition.",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16178,Presentation,"Our customers are surprised and delighted to find more items on the shopping list at tremendous values, which will increase her frequency of visiting going forward. Our earliest reads from pantry optimization are indicating that we are getting lifts in our consumables business, as well as the food categories where we expanded space for entertainment foods and coffee. This is partially offset by our exiting or reducing of less productive categories such as freezer, cooler, and cans, and pasta. More to come as this strategy continues to mature.",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16179,Presentation,"Coming back to the third quarter, as we commented in prior updates, we started the quarter strongly. This strength continued despite the ending of the stimulus driven sales surge from mid-April through mid-summer as customers continue to improve their living spaces with indoor and outdoor furniture and home related accessories. Additionally, as focus turn to seasonal shopping for Halloween and harvest and then for early Christmas selling, we saw continued strength in October. As I mentioned, the momentum has continued into Q4.",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16180,Presentation,"Turning to our category performance, our merchant teams did an outstanding job planning the assortments for Q3 with all seven divisions reporting increases in the quarter. Furniture sales increased 25% versus last year with all departments driving double-digit comp growth. Upholstery and home office were both up 30% with ready to assemble mattresses and case goods, all up around 20% to last year.",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16181,Presentation,"The Broyhill brand had a strong impact on furniture, representing 17% of total furniture sales in the quarter. Upholstery was particularly least strong for Broyhill driving 30% of total department sales. Mattresses grew at 18% and although our suppliers continued to face challenges associated with raw material shortages, the Big Lots team moved quickly to supplements supplied by adding new skews and new vendors.",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16182,Presentation,,Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16183,Presentation,"Soft Home had double digit comp increases led by strong trends within the window basic bedding and dcor, categories. Window was up over 45% with curtains up over 50%, driven by incremental Broyhill and national brand offerings. Dcor saw double-digit growth driven by Broyhill, Christmas and art, Comforter sets were up over 20% on strength of Broyhill and opportunity buys. Pillows and pads were up 33% and 34%, respectively.",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16184,Presentation,"Our seasonal business also had a terrific quarter fueled by early selling in our Christmas assortment, driving a 42% comp increase over prior year and contributing significantly to our overall comp. Our Harvest and Halloween assortments contributed additional growth over last year, partially offset by summer and patio assortments due to high sell through in these categories in the second quarter.",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16185,Presentation,"Electronics toys and accessories posted a comp increase in the mid-50s for Q3 driven by 94% increase in our toy business thanks to good momentum through the quarter, as well as our 50% off toy promotion near the end of the quarter. Hard home comps were up 20% to last year with all departments trending positively. Key areas such as kitchen appliances, cookware, bake ware, dinnerware and drink ware drove top line by over 40% on a comparable stores basis, in part due to the cook and dine-at-home trend.",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16186,Presentation,"Consumables comped up approximately 10% in the quarter with positive results across all departments except paper, where we were faced with inventory challenges early in the quarter. Food was up 1% in the quarter, a very good result considering the team had to transition a good part of the assortment for a pantry optimization initiative and the lack of a friends and family event, as compared to last year where food and consumables both over indexed during the event.",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16187,Presentation,"Across all categories closeout sales in the third quarter were up around 50% over the same quarter in 2019. Closeouts are an important part of our heritage and a significant reason why she shops us. We are planning for continued strong growth going forward. Our active rewards membership reach and historic high with 8% growth over Q3 2019, and rewards customers in total spent 28% more versus last year.",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16188,Presentation,"The big heroes program resonated with our customers as members of the military and veterans, first responders, medical professionals, commercial drivers and teachers spend significantly more per customer than others. Starting last month, we have rolled out an ongoing discount to active military and veterans and greatly value our ability to support these heroes in a practical way every day. Meanwhile, we continue to delight our customers as reflected in high and increasing net promoter scores and we continue to accelerate our acquisition of new customers.",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16189,Presentation,I'll now turn the call over to Jonathan for more insight on our financial results for the quarter.,Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16190,Presentation,"Thanks, Bruce and good morning everyone. I would like to add my thanks for the incredible efforts of our team over the past quarter. It has truly been remarkable to see how the team is knitted together so tightly through these challenging times and how our values have remained over the center of everything we do.",Jonathan Ramsden,4393052
,,,,
16191,Presentation,"Net sales for the third quarter were 1.378 billion, an 18% increase, compared to 1.168 billion a year ago. The growth resulted from a comparable sales increase of 17.8% and sales growth in new and relocated stores not in the comp base. Comps were driven by a slight increase in store traffic, e-com traffic up over 50% and strong growth in basket across both channels. In terms of cadence through the quarter, the underlying trend by month was fairly consistent after adjusting for the effects of changes in promotional cadence and intensity.",Jonathan Ramsden,4393052
,,,,
16192,Presentation,"The seasonal pattern of comps was different however, with strong Halloween and harvest selling in August and September, and strong early Christmas selling beginning in mid-September and running through October. Net income for the third quarter was $29.9 million, compared to an adjusted net loss of $7 million in Q3 of 2019. EPS for the quarter was $0.76, $0.06 above the high-end of our guidance range provided at the end of September. As a reminder, we reported an adjusted EPS loss of $0.18 last year.",Jonathan Ramsden,4393052
,,,,
16193,Presentation,,Jonathan Ramsden,4393052
,,,,
16194,Presentation,"The gross margin rate for Q3 was 40.5%, up around 80 basis points from last year's third quarter rate. This was better than we anticipated at the beginning of the quarter and reflected a lower markdown rate and an overall mix benefit offset by higher freight costs lapping some tariff rebates from the third quarter of last year and a slight impact from our pantry optimization strategy. For Q4 we expect gross margin rate to be approximately flat to last year, due to a lower year-over-year markdown benefit, offset by higher freight costs and a somewhat greater impact from pantry optimization.",Jonathan Ramsden,4393052
,,,,
16195,Presentation,"Total expense dollars for the quarter, including depreciation were $515 million, up from $468 million of adjusted expenses last year. Key drivers of the increase were $12 million of additional expense from the sale and leaseback of our distribution centers, $10 million of additional store and corporate bonus expense, $8 million of higher non-cash stock compensation expense, as well as ongoing COVID-related cleaning costs and supplies and some overall expense flex on higher sales. ",Jonathan Ramsden,4393052
,,,,
16196,Presentation,"These drivers will largely continue into Q4 and result in similar dollar expense growth to Q3. Notwithstanding these increases, expenses for the third quarter levered approximately 270 basis points versus last year, resulting in excellent flow-through of sales growth to operating income.",Jonathan Ramsden,4393052
,,,,
16197,Presentation,"As we referenced during our last call, we remain focused on continuing to gain cost efficiency in our business, both through an ongoing data-driven and ROI-focused approach to expenses and through continuing to grow a culture of thoughtful frugality. We continue to make strong progress on cost reduction, and those efforts will continue into 2021 and beyond, with key areas of focus being labor costs, supply chain, marketing expenditures, general office expense, and non-merchandise procurement.",Jonathan Ramsden,4393052
,,,,
16198,Presentation,"Interest expense for the quarter was $2.6 million, down from $5.4 million in Q3 last year, primarily as a result of paying off the balance on our unsecured line of credit in the prior quarter, partially offset by notional interest associated with the gain deferral on our sale-leaseback transactions.",Jonathan Ramsden,4393052
,,,,
16199,Presentation,"The income tax rate in the third quarter was 24.1%, compared to last year?s adjusted rate of 31.7%, both impacted by the resolution of discrete items. Prior to discrete items, this year?s income tax rate was 26.4%, compared to last year?s adjusted rate of 26.1%.",Jonathan Ramsden,4393052
,,,,
16200,Presentation,"Moving on to the balance sheet. Inventory ended the quarter at $1.089 billion, a 2.5% reduction, compared to $1.117 billion last year, with the decline resulting mainly from our very strong sales performance. Total inventory included a significant increase in in-transit inventory, as we chase sales and work to get back in stock for the holiday selling season. ",Jonathan Ramsden,4393052
,,,,
16201,Presentation,"Inventory on hand in our stores was down by a mid-teen percentage at the end of Q3. Including in-transit, our Q4 inventory is likely to be closer to flat, given some acceleration in early Q1 receipts due to the Chinese New Year.",Jonathan Ramsden,4393052
,,,,
16202,Presentation,"During Q3, we opened 13 new stores and closed 6 stores, leaving us with 1,411 stores and total selling square footage of 32.1 million. For the full-year, we now expect our ending store count to be 1,408 stores with 24 store openings and 20 closings. ",Jonathan Ramsden,4393052
,,,,
16203,Presentation,"We have been successful in reducing our closings with a process addressing store underperformance before the end of the lease term, and we have added new capabilities with analytics and modeling to assist with future site evaluation. We expect these actions to support a marked acceleration in the growth of our store footprint beginning in 2021, including our highest number of Q1 openings in many years. ",Jonathan Ramsden,4393052
,,,,
16204,Presentation,"Capital expenditures for the quarter were $34 million, compared to $69 million last year, with the decline primarily coming from fewer store of the future conversions and fewer new store openings, partially offset by investing in The Lot and Queue Line rollouts. Year-to-date CapEx is $103 million versus $232 million last year.",Jonathan Ramsden,4393052
,,,,
16205,Presentation,,Jonathan Ramsden,4393052
,,,,
16206,Presentation,"Depreciation expense in Q3 was $33 million; approximately $1.6 million lower than the same period last year. For the full-year, we expect capital expenditures to be between $150 million and $160 million.",Jonathan Ramsden,4393052
,,,,
16207,Presentation,We ended the third quarter with $548 million of cash and cash equivalents and $39 million of long-term debt. This compares to $62 million of cash and cash equivalents and $501 million of long-term debt at the end of the third quarter last year.,Jonathan Ramsden,4393052
,,,,
16208,Presentation,"Regarding shareholder return actions, we repurchased 2.2 million shares during the quarter for $100 million at an average cost per share of $45.81 under our previously announced $500 million share repurchase authorization. Also, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 of $0.30 per common share. This dividend is payable on December 30, 2020 to shareholders of record on the close of business on December 16, 2020.",Jonathan Ramsden,4393052
,,,,
16209,Presentation,"Share repurchases remain an important part of our capital allocation strategy going forward in particular, given our significant excess liquidity. At this point, we are not providing sales or EPS guidance for the fourth quarter and full-year. However, as we did in Q2 and Q3, we expect to provide a business update in early January, when we will have greater visibility into the outcome for the quarter. As Bruce referenced, our fourth quarter is on track and we look forward to closing out a solid year.",Jonathan Ramsden,4393052
,,,,
16210,Presentation,I'll now turn the call back over to our moderator so that we can begin to address your questions. Thank you.,Jonathan Ramsden,4393052
,,,,
16211,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Greg Badishkanian from Wolfe Research. Your line is now live.,Operator,4393052
,,,,
16212,Question-and-Answer,"Good morning. This is Spencer Hanus on for Greg. You mentioned that your comps were up low-double digits quarter-to-date. Could you talk about any categories that are outperforming or underperforming that trend? And then, are you seeing any signs of shoppers stocking up just given the rise in COVID cases around the country?",Spencer Hanus,4393052
,,,,
16213,Question-and-Answer,"Hi, Spencer. This is Bruce. I?ll start off and Jonathan can add to it and also thank you for the recent Wolfe coverage. Just speaking about Q3 merch and what we're seeing, I'd say across the board, as we mentioned in the opening remarks, we?re really pleased with all divisions positively comping. I think some of the standout areas are Soft Home, up over 20%, really driven like you heard from the window, bedding and so forth. We've got a lot of closeouts in that area too. We've got our apparel in that section and that's actually resonating well with the customer.",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16214,Question-and-Answer,"On top of that, our Furniture division did quite well, strong Broyhill performance, once again over 20% comp in that area, as well as the upholstery ? overall upholstery and mattress sales. Hard Home continues to do quite well. The nesting, the cocooning if you will, is alive and well with Jennifer. Kitchen appliances, cookware, dinnerware, all of those areas doing quite well and also closeouts in instapots and air fryer type of products, those all worked very well.",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16215,Question-and-Answer,"Overall, the value is big at this time of year and with the COVID issues that are going on here, closeouts were up nearly 50% Q3 year-over-year. But we're really proud of all the performance across all the divisions, especially when you think about we did a pantry optimization transition and food still comped up while giving up space and comping of friends and family last year and consumables did quite well with our emphasis on health and beauty and tech. So, we're actually very pleased with what we're seeing.",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16216,Question-and-Answer,"We are seeing, with COVID-19 starting to peak again, that there's a buy up in the paper and cleaning products and that's something that's been going on here, but we're still seeing strong purchases to improve the workplace at home and living conditions at home.",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16217,Question-and-Answer,,Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16218,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, I would just add, Spencer, just, you know, a couple of minor data points or a couple data points. You know, we're up, you know, across all categories quarter-to-date in Q4. You know, we did see a bit ? we have seen a bit of a spike in consumables, you know, referencing that, you know, sort of stock up component that's going on. And then, seasonal, you know, we've done well early and we also did well on seasonal Christmas, in particular, in October, we got some early business there that continued through November. So that has been relatively strong and we sold through certainly a significant higher proportion of our Christmas inventory at this point than we had a year ago.",Jonathan Ramsden,4393052
,,,,
16219,Question-and-Answer,"That's really helpful. And then, it was nice to see the sequential improvement in your inventory this quarter. Can you talk about how well-positioned you think you are for the holiday season from that standpoint? And then, in terms of the sell-through that you have on your items in Q4, are you happy with where you are today just given the changes in the timing of holiday sales? Thanks.",Spencer Hanus,4393052
,,,,
16220,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, I?d say, overall, we are. You know, the quarter is playing out so far as we planned it would. You know, we thought we would, you know, start off strong and we thought there would be a pull-forward of business to pre-Thanksgiving, early shopping again for Christmas, and so on and we've seen both of those things play out. So, we ? you know, we plan the business to moderate from November into December, so we're very comfortable with where we are and all that.",Jonathan Ramsden,4393052
,,,,
16221,Question-and-Answer,"You know, Christmas inventory is pretty sold through. You know, frankly, we had a little bit more of that. We would be happy, but we?re fine with how we planned it. And overall, we're happy with where we're tracking on inventory. We do expect the on-hand inventory levels in stores to progressively get better through the end of the quarter and to be at, you know, kind of more normalized levels. And certainly, we have given up a little bit of sales volume from the very low on-hand inventory levels we've been running.",Jonathan Ramsden,4393052
,,,,
16222,Question-and-Answer,"Great, thank you.",Spencer Hanus,4393052
,,,,
16223,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Joe Feldman from Telsey Advisory Group. Your line is now live.,Operator,4393052
,,,,
16224,Question-and-Answer,"Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions and congratulation on the quarter actually. You mentioned some new customers and you're doing a good job retaining them. I was just curious if you could share a little bit more about the new customer, what you're seeing, you know, how they?re may be different from existing customers and talk a little more about how you are retaining them and getting them to come back?",Joe Feldman,4393052
,,,,
16225,Question-and-Answer,"Hi, Joe, thank you. I'll take it first and Jonathan can add on. We're seeing that as the COVID trend continues, there's new types of customers that she's focused on, on value shopping, home shopping, home furnishing, making the home life a better one, the work life at home better, and definitely e-commerce, you know, making it easier. We're seeing strong e-commerce shoppers coming in. Some of our customer acquisition, some of our strongest customer acquisition is coming from online.",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16226,Question-and-Answer,"We're also seeing a lot of customers coming in because they've heard that we've got Broyhill and Broyhill is an iconic brand that she loves and that's a new source of customer for us and that customer is coming back, you know, half the time very quickly and purchasing other things across the store. We are seeing that our membership and our rewards this quarter was up ? in Q3 was up over 8% and we're encroaching on 21 million customers on our rewards database. But quite frankly, well, I think what we've got here is a customer that is looking for value, is looking for an easy shopping experience, convenience and friendliness during a time that's very difficult.",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16227,Question-and-Answer,,Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16228,Question-and-Answer,"So, what we're doing to keep her is having more promotions that reward her like $10 off on a $40 purchase, a bounce back. We've heard her loud and clear on first responders. The 15% off we did in Q3 was a huge success. 10% off military veterans all the time is something else that is ? that's bringing those customers back over and over again.",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16229,Question-and-Answer,"We've increased our social media engagement with them and our impressions Q3 year-over-year went from somewhere like a quarter of a million impressions to over 9 million through social influencers, so all of these things reaching on a more personal level through email and the things that she enjoys on the products that she needs, is boding well for us.",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16230,Question-and-Answer,"That?s great, thanks and if I could follow up and some of what you just said might answer this next question, but I know it's a little early, but as you think about next year and having to lap a lot of the strengths that you've seen, it would seem to me that you have a lot of good initiatives in place to help sustain some level of sales, and you know, how should we think about the puts and takes for next year with regard to sales? It seems like there's an underlying core base of business that you should be able to maintain and just, are we thinking about that the right way? Thanks.",Joe Feldman,4393052
,,,,
16231,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. You know, Joe, the way I think about is, I think, you know, this year, you know, while it was very difficult for all of us to go through COVID-19, still going through this terrible pandemic, but we picked up a lot of new Jennifers and they discovered Big Lots maybe for the first time in 2020. Like I said, we?re on our way to 21 million rewards customers.",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16232,Question-and-Answer,"I think a few things here, value never goes out of style and with our increased focus on close outs, and our penetration of own brands, and an assortment of never outs that are competitively priced and consistent, that goes a long way. I think that easy never goes out of style either and our small-box format, you know, discount, neighborhood store, getting in and out easily with omni-channel ease that we've got now being the Number 1 total ? according to total retail omni-channel company out there, you know, we're letting her shop on her terms.",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16233,Question-and-Answer,"Convenience, you know, we're adding more stores; our assortment is improving; we're adding services that are online like [indiscernible] online, pick-up in-store. And then, friendly, you know, we've got the highest NPS scores we've ever had and some of the highest I've ever worked at in a retailer. And I think all that comes together with our operation Northstar strategy going into 2021, where we're going to complete the roll-out for Lot, the Queue.",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16234,Question-and-Answer,"We're going to continue to leverage pantry optimization; we're going to grow Broyhill closer to a $1 billion business over the out years; e-commerce continues to strengthen and our fund enabled programs continue to get better. So, I'm optimistic about our core set of strategic initiatives and the new customers that we've gained this year going into next year.",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16235,Question-and-Answer,That?s great. Thanks so much for that Bruce and good luck with this quarter guys.,Joe Feldman,4393052

16236,Question-and-Answer,Appreciate it Joe.,Bruce Thorn,4393052

16237,Question-and-Answer,"Thanks, Joe.",Jonathan Ramsden ,4393052
,,,,
16238,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Peter Keith from Piper Jaffray. Your line is now live.,Operator,4393052
,,,,
16239,Question-and-Answer,"Hi, thanks. Good morning, everyone and nice results. Bruce maybe to follow-up on the last question, just looking out to 2021, it does seem like your closeouts are starting to pick-up, how do you feel about the business momentum there and the team that's in place to go after and procure those types of close outs, is this something that you think is going to continue to ramp rather significantly as we look forward to the coming months?",Peter Keith,4393052
,,,,
16240,Question-and-Answer,,Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16241,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, hi, Peter. Yes, we're excited about our closeout progress that we've done this year. You know, we're growing our closeouts across all categories with the exception of seasonal, which is more self explanatory, but continue to see us grow in all categories. I think really where we're looking at and targeting is penetration where the intersection of quality of the closeout and price makes sense for her, and I think there's a long runway there going into 2021 and years beyond.",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16242,Question-and-Answer,"We've got a good heritage, a good muscle at Big Lots with merchants that understand the art of the deal and looking for these opportunities and we've seen, you know some of the greatest growth so far in Soft Home apparel, Hard Home, and we?ll continue to get after that. You know, Jack Pestello, our new Chief Merchant, he's got targets by category for DMMs and GMMs. We continue to practice art of the deal training. We've got weekly reporting on this and we're growing our sources.",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16243,Question-and-Answer,"You know, we really think that, you know, our job is to be value creators out there in the marketplace and this is a great way along with our own brands and our never-out?s competitively priced to give her what she needs. So, we see more promising growth in this area.",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16244,Question-and-Answer,"Okay, that sounds exciting. A second question would be for Jonathan, on your comments around gross margin flat year-on-year, somewhat surprising because of their lapping 180 basis points decline from a year ago and it seems like your seasonal products are going to have effectively no markdowns. You highlighted mix as one minor driver, but most of the categories to start the quarter seemed margin accretive. So, it kind of lands on freight and I guess is that becoming a rather meaningful headwind? It seems like, you know, mathematically it could be 150 basis points to 200 basis points of margin headwind on the quarter.",Peter Keith,4393052
,,,,
16245,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. Hey, Peter. Let me give you a little more color on that. Yes, it's not ? the freight headwind is not that significant. I mean, it's ? you know it's somewhat meaningful and it's reflecting the fact that, you know I think you've heard it, you know, from other retailers, there are, you know, a lot of volume going through, you know, the system right now. You know, we've got a lot of inventory flowing through our DCs. We're getting, you know, some detention charges for, you know, dwell time that?s little longer than usual, and then, just the actual transportation rates are higher, so that is a factor.",Jonathan Ramsden,4393052
,,,,
16246,Question-and-Answer,"Pantry optimization is a somewhat greater factor in Q4 and that ? you know, that strong, you know comp in consumables driven by stock-up, but also by pantry optimization, in general, has a negative impact on gross margin rate. We think, you know, we're getting it back through topline, but it does impact the rate a little bit.",Jonathan Ramsden,4393052
,,,,
16247,Question-and-Answer,"And then, we've had, full year, as you know, a little bit of adverse shrink effect. We'll begin our next cycle of physical inventories in January and we'll get a, you know, new read on where we are, you know, coming through the next cycle, but we've had that headwind resulting from last year's physical inventories that we've been dealing with, you know, throughout this year.",Jonathan Ramsden,4393052
,,,,
16248,Question-and-Answer,"So, this is a sum of a few individual items adding up. You know, we do overall expect to be somewhat less promotional than last year and we will still get a markdown and promotional benefit, but it?s being largely offset by those other items.",Jonathan Ramsden,4393052
,,,,
16249,Question-and-Answer,"Okay, thanks. That?s helpful. Good luck for the rest of the holiday, guys.",Peter Keith ,4393052

16252,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. Our next question today is coming from a line of Anthony Chukumba from Loop Capital Markets. Your line is now live.,Operator,4393052
,,,,
16253,Question-and-Answer,"Good morning. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the strong quarter. So, just two quick questions. You know, you talked about e-commerce and BOPUS, I was just wondering if you could give us any color in terms of the sales penetration from e-commerce? And then ? I guess that's my first question.",Anthony Chukumba,4393052
,,,,
16254,Question-and-Answer,,Anthony Chukumba,4393052
,,,,
16255,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. Thanks, Anthony. Good morning. You know, just first off, we're so proud of our e-commerce team. They're truly playing the win and we're pleased with our growth in the quarter; 70% in Q3 alone; 170 basis points of overall comp for the quarter coming from e-commerce, traffic up over 50%. I'd say as you break it down, BOPUS and curbside pickup remains the majority of that growth and about 50% to 60% of the overall growth and we're pleased with that because it's profitable delivery on her terms.",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16256,Question-and-Answer,"We are proud of the fact that we offered same day delivery with Instacart and now with PICKUP, and that continues to grow at and is becoming a significant part of the e-commerce growth. And then, two-day delivery out of 47, you know, strategically located stores across the United States given 90% of the U.S. customers, two-day delivery is something that she truly enjoys, because it's a lower cost of her two-day shipping period. And then, adding Big Lots credit cards and gift cards and doubling the skews out that are being offered online year-over-year, all of these things have allowed us to truly grow this business in a meaningful and profitable way. ",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16257,Question-and-Answer,"We're excited about also being a true omni-channel retailer as we go through a holiday here because last year, you know, we weren't able to do the things we are this year. This year, we're able to offer all of this and shipping all the way up to December 18, which allows us to play ? compete with the pure plays and also pass that day to deliver to the customer if she wants to come into our store and shop up to Christmas or curbside pickup. So, that's a little bit of the breakdown of where we are in e-commerce and we think we've got a lot more room to grow.",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16258,Question-and-Answer,"Got it. And then, you talked about closeouts being up 50% and I was just wondering if you could give us any sense for ? you know, I'm assuming they're not a terribly material percentage of your overall sales at this point, but with just less color in terms of, you know, what ? how much they're contributing? Thank you.",Anthony Chukumba,4393052
,,,,
16259,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. Yes, no. It's a good question. You know, with the tremendous sales growth we've had over the year, you know, the closeout penetration can get a bit lost in the ? as the denominator grows, but it is a ? it's still slightly less than 10% of overall penetration of the store, and ? but the interesting thing is to see the dollar growth and what could be, you know, year-over-year, like we said nearly 50% in a quarter, and you know, this is all about us starting that engine back up with our supply base and getting the connections out there and constantly growing it.",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16260,Question-and-Answer,"And what's really nice about these closeouts is a tremendous treasure hunt and excitement our customers get from it, especially across all these categories. Like I said earlier, the Soft Home area getting ? and with apparel and the items we're able to bring along with Hard Home, all these things ? these are exciting products at great prices, good quality, tremendous value, and at good margin points for us as a company. So, we're happy about this and we see a long runway.",Bruce Thorn,4393052

,,,,
16265,Question-and-Answer,"Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question and congratulations on a strong quarter. You guys talked about rolling out ship from store capabilities to 47 stores for a two-day delivery. Could you perhaps talk about what the early reads are there? How should we think about the pace of rollout? And what sort of margin implications does that hold, you know investments from an SG&A standpoint, any additional labor requirements or any DC savings as a result of this initiative? Thank you.",Chandni Luthra,4393052
,,,,
16266,Question-and-Answer,,Chandni Luthra,4393052
,,,,
16267,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah, I?ll start with this, and I?m not sure we?re going to get into the details of the numbers yet, Chandni. But I will tell you that we?re excited about adding our delivery service to 47 stores, as you implied in your question. What?s nice about this is, we give our customer another option other than same-day or five to seven days shipping from a DC. We are now able to reach 90% of the U.S. customers that we serve in a two-day delivery with help from our FedEx partners.",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16268,Question-and-Answer,"And so, these stores have minimal labor in their backrooms to set up these shipping lines. And it hasn?t ? it?s been somewhat nominal at the current situation. And I?d also say that as we look across our fleet of stores, this may be an expanded program in the out years as we continue to lower the freight costs associated and maybe increase service time. And then once again, as you implied, it definitely takes a load off of our e-com distribution center in Columbus. And so this is overall a win for us and a win for the customer.",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16269,Question-and-Answer,"And it really comes down to our order management ? our distribution, order management systems, which we continue to improve and reduce split shipments and other friction points for the customer. So, we?re excited about where we?re going with this. Not sure we want to go into all the numbers of it at this point. It?s early, and she?s enjoying the service.",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16270,Question-and-Answer,"That?s very helpful. Thank you. And if I may follow-up with a more 2021-2022, longer term question on just your real estate plans. Obviously, a lot going on with the market. How should we think about store openings versus closing opportunity? Any rent negotiations that may come about, and just general prospects as you think about your store footprint in the future? Thank you so much.",Chandni Luthra,4393052
,,,,
16271,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. Hey, Chandni, it?s Jonathan. I?ll be happy to take that one. Yes. So, as we alluded to in the prepared remarks, we are planning to have a significant acceleration in net store count growth. We?re going to end this year with a net four openings and closings.",Jonathan Ramsden,4393052
,,,,
16272,Question-and-Answer,"We did pull back early in the year on openings, back in the very early days of the COVID crisis. And then a decent number of those have ended up moving into Q1 of 2021. So, we?re going to have our strongest Q1 opening cadence for many years coming up, and that will get us off to a good start in 2021 overall. But we?re planning for a much more significant net store count increase in 2021 than we?ve seen this year and then from where we?ve been on average over the past 10 years or so.",Jonathan Ramsden,4393052
,,,,
16273,Question-and-Answer,And then we believe real estate more generally is a significant opportunity for us. We think we can keep that pace going. We think there are significant opportunities for us both in our conventional stores and potentially in some other formats that we?re going to be exploring. And that?s a high priority for us from a growth standpoint over the coming years.,Jonathan Ramsden,4393052
,,,,
16274,Question-and-Answer,"One of the reasons why we are more confident about that is the store performance intervention program we?ve been running has enabled us to significantly reduce the number of stores we?re going to close. And obviously, getting our net store count up can be a combination of both of opening more stores, but also closing fewer stores. So, we feel good about that piece of it.",Jonathan Ramsden,4393052
,,,,
16275,Question-and-Answer,"And then we have much better analytics now, partly because of the data we?ve been able to export from our CRM database about who our customer is, where we have opportunities in markets that we haven?t penetrated significantly in the past, and that?s opening up areas of opportunity for us to significantly grow our store count over the coming years. So, it?s a critical lever for us. We are very excited about the opportunity there. And you should certainly expect to see an acceleration in 2021.",Jonathan Ramsden,4393052

16277,Question-and-Answer,Thank you so much.,Chandni Luthra,4393052
,,,,
16278,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Paul Trussell from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live.,Operator,4393052
,,,,
16279,Question-and-Answer,"Hi. Good morning. This is Gaby Carbone on for Paul. Congratulations on the nice quarter. So, I kind of had a bigger picture question, just wanted to ask about the overall assortment. I?m wondering if you can get some details around the evolution of your category mix this past year, and kind of how you kind of see it evolving moving ahead. Thanks.",Gaby Carbone,4393052
,,,,
16280,Question-and-Answer,"Hi, Gaby. This is Bruce. I?ll tell you what we?re really pleased with the assortment we?ve had in 2020, especially when you consider the tremendous roller coaster we?ve been through, all of Americans have been through, the world for that matter with COVID-19. I think that we have a nice balance overall at a high level between essential everyday needs for the everyday Jennifer shopping, and we hope to continue to refine that. ",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16281,Question-and-Answer,"So, we get more of her shopping trips through the year. And we also have a nice blend of assortment for the home. And more and more people, I think, even past COVID-19, there?s going to be more of a cocooning or working-from-home trend that?s going to prevail over the years. And I think we have a nice assortment as well, very well situated to improve the home environment, the work-from-home environment, the school-from-home environment, both indoor and outdoor furniture etcetera.",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16282,Question-and-Answer,"So, I think, overall, how we play into everyday essentials and convenience at work, live, school-at-home is key. I think that we ? like I?ve said before, we?re going to continue to lean into value and that value is going to come across all categories with our closeout penetration increasing. We?re going to also lean into value through own brands, where we can offer a great quality product at an incredible price to our customers, and then compete on the convenience of everyday items that she expects and the consistency on competitively priced name products.",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16283,Question-and-Answer,"I think we?ll continue to see growth in consumables. The cleaning trend, the needs in the house will continue to grow. That will be something that we are prepared for and we?ve emphasized that in our pantry optimization. We?ll continue to adjust that. I think our seasonal business will continue to grow and we?ll lean into that as well. It?s a strong business. It?s what we?re known for. It?s a traffic-driving business for us.",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16284,Question-and-Answer,"Overall, Soft Home, Hard Home and Furniture, all those categories are tremendous growth categories for us, where even in more normal times, we?ve been taking market share with our double-digit growth in furniture. So, we?ll lean into those areas as well. So, I think the key thing is, we?re value creators and we are obsessed about finding value deals in all those categories. But I think overall, we?re situated nicely and we may be testing a few other white space opportunities like how far we can go into apparel where it makes sense along with some other categories through the year that would then set us up for 2022 and beyond.",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16285,Question-and-Answer,"Great. And just a quick follow-up, I wanted to ask about your efforts to reduce your cost base, and maybe where you kind of see further opportunities?",Gaby Carbone,4393052
,,,,
16286,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. Hey, Gaby, I?ll be able to take that one. Yes, we?ve made excellent progress on that. And again, it?s really a two-pronged approach. One is looking at our cost base from a structural standpoint and that goes back to the original $100 million target savings goal we put out a year or more ago at this point. And then sort of bottoms-up approach of being frugal in how we think about all of our expenses.",Jonathan Ramsden,4393052
,,,,
16287,Question-and-Answer,"So, we?re pushing on both of those fronts. And we continue to see, as we said in the prepared remarks, opportunities in a range of areas in 2021. We think that the Whole Family Journey program has still got some significant legs to it. And frankly, it will go on notch in 2021, but beyond that, I mean, it?s really an ongoing mindset to continue to take cost out of the business, but multiple areas of opportunity, as we referenced in the prepared remarks.",Jonathan Ramsden,4393052
,,,,
16288,Question-and-Answer,,Jonathan Ramsden,4393052

16289,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. Best of luck.,Gaby Carbone,4393052

16290,Question-and-Answer,Thank you.,Jonathan Ramsden,4393052
,,,,
16291,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Karen Short from Barclays. Your line is now live.,Operator,4393052
,,,,
16292,Question-and-Answer,"Hi. Good morning. This is actually Renato Basanta on for Karen. Thanks for taking the question. So first, I just wanted to follow-up on some of the discussion around 2021. Specifically, with respect to how you?re going to manage the P&L and what?s obviously a pretty volatile environment. If you look at consensus for next year, has you down at ? down 7% comp, which may or may not be close to what actually happens, but that type of sales drop implies 100s of basis points of deleverage before taking into account any cost levers you may have. So, just wondering if you could help us frame how you?re thinking about the P&L in that type of scenario, and maybe some of the levers you can pull to manage?",Renato Basanta,4393052
,,,,
16293,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. Hey, Renato, I?ll be happy to help with that. And you?re right. It certainly is a more complex story than usual. And it?s also a different story by quarter as you go through the year, depending on what we?re up against quarter-by-quarter. So, we?re obviously spending a lot of time looking at that, thinking about what overall trends will be. I want to go back a little bit to start that question with what Bruce was talking about earlier and all the initiatives we have rolling out.",Jonathan Ramsden,4393052
,,,,
16294,Question-and-Answer,"If you go all the way back to the beginning of this year, we talked about that we expected our comp performance to progressively get better through the year as we rolled out things like The Lot and the Queue and Pantry Optimization and Broyhill and our e-com capabilities. And that story has been masked by other things that have gone on around nesting and stimulus, but it has held true. And if you look at our underlying performance, we have seen, we believe, an acceleration in comps through the year, which will support us going into 2021.",Jonathan Ramsden,4393052
,,,,
16295,Question-and-Answer,"As you get into 2021 quarter-by-quarter, it is a different story. I mean, in Q1 of 2020, we had the stock up effect in March, which will happen. That degraded our margin to some degree, so there will be a margin benefit when we?re up against that. But we would assume at this point that there?s a reasonable likelihood that the nesting trend will continue to some degree, at least into Q1, and then we?ll start to lap it as we get further into the year.",Jonathan Ramsden,4393052
,,,,
16296,Question-and-Answer,"I think what we also know from this year is that had we had more inventory at certain points in the year there, we would have been able to do more sales. So that?s a bit of an opportunity as we think about 2021 and lapping some of those areas. And then from an overall margin and expense standpoint, we?re still working through all of that.",Jonathan Ramsden,4393052
,,,,
16297,Question-and-Answer,"A big wildcard in all of this is obviously, whether there?s any second round of stimulus momentum, that seems to have picked up a little bit in the last couple of days, but we?ll see as we plan our own business, we haven?t counted on that. We?re trying to make sure we?re planning it appropriately conservatively. But as that comes, that can certainly be a significant game changer for the first half of 2021 and potentially beyond. But we are working through all that detail now.",Jonathan Ramsden,4393052
,,,,
16298,Question-and-Answer,"I would say the one other critical point that we take out of 2020 is we learned about our ability to be much more nimble than perhaps we thought we were in the past. And we?ve been able to react really quickly through 2020 and not just be sort of stuck and locked into a particular plan. And I think that gives us confidence that we will be able to react as we move through 2021 in a similar way, but I think the most important point from my perspective is that the underlying strength of our business and our strategies should serve us well in 2021 regardless of the reversal of any stimulus or other impact.",Jonathan Ramsden,4393052
,,,,
16299,Question-and-Answer,,Jonathan Ramsden,4393052
,,,,
16300,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. That?s helpful. And then just wanted to follow-up on e-commerce a bit. You talked about doubling the skews. But I was wondering if you could speak to the percentage of the in-store assortment that?s actually available online today, and your efforts to continue to expand that. And then curious about where you think you are with respect to the e-commerce investment cycle? And what levels and the kind of investments we should be expecting going forward?",Renato Basanta,4393052
,,,,
16301,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. I?ll start off with that. The e-commerce growth and the 2x skews from last year, I mean those are basically, I mean, it?s not every skew that we cover in store, but our ability to have that assortment available and to be curbside pickup or ship-from-store at this point is a great improvement from where we were, and it?s not incremental in the sense that we?re creating redundant skews or more cost. We?re being able to leverage our infrastructure for that, which is a profitable way to grow the e-com business.",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16302,Question-and-Answer,"In terms of investment in e-commerce, some of the major investments we did this year have been absorbed at this point in terms of turning on the Instacart, the pickup delivery system, as well as the 47 stores, but this is a lot of in-house work and our IT team working with our e-commerce team has just done an unbelievably great job being scrappy about this.",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16303,Question-and-Answer,"So, into 2021, this is really about now bringing operational excellence into the mix and refining the processes, making them better, maybe a few systems tweaks. So, we?re still a ways off from any major system overhauls and infrastructure overhauls. We?ve got runway here. So, it?s more of an improvement, incremental investments rather than stair step.",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16304,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. That?s great. And then just one quick one, if I may, on COVID costs, and sorry if I missed it, but wondering what that was in the quarter? What you?re expecting to look like into 4Q? And then as we look into next year, what your expectations are in terms of how much of these COVID costs you expect to stick around? Thank you.",Renato Basanta,4393052
,,,,
16305,Question-and-Answer,"You kind of broke up on us. I?m not sure what you were asking, the first part of your question, costs or something in Q4. What was that?",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16306,Question-and-Answer,"What the COVID costs were in 3Q? What your expectations are for 4Q? And then for next year, how much of the cost you expect to stick around?",Renato Basanta,4393052
,,,,
16307,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, hey, Renato. Yes, so we?re running $5 million or $6 million of incremental cleaning costs and supplies. That?s the primary ongoing costs that we?re referring to. Obviously, on top of that, through 2020, we did pay some higher hourly rates. We paid higher store bonuses and corporate bonuses for that matter than usual, given the very strong performance. But that $5 million or $6 million, we assume will continue at least through the first two quarters of 2021 at this point.",Jonathan Ramsden,4393052
,,,,
16308,Question-and-Answer,Great. Thanks for the color.,Renato Basanta,4393052
,,,,
16309,Question-and-Answer,Thank you.,Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16310,Question-and-Answer,Our next question is coming from Jason Haas from Bank of America. Your line is now live.,Operator,4393052
,,,,
16311,Question-and-Answer,"Thanks for taking my question. Can you provide more color on the low double-digit rate that you?re seeing quarter-to-date? And if that represents a moderation from 3Q, what?s that attributable to? And then also, has that rate been consistent so far now through Black Friday?",Jason Haas,4393052
,,,,
16312,Question-and-Answer,"Well, I?ll start off and Jonathan will get more precise, I believe. But we?re happy that we?ve had a good start to the Q4. We?ve been managing our promotional cadence very well. We did a nice job in Q3 that continued into Q4. We closed partially on Thanksgiving Day and that was something ? a decision we made with our customer in mind and also our associates in mind. And we noticed that in past that most of our Jennifer?s shop early and finish up by 1 P.M. for the most part. And that allowed us to stay open for her needs and also get our associates back home with their families to enjoy Thanksgiving.",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16313,Question-and-Answer,,Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16314,Question-and-Answer,"Expectations-wise, we met expectations on Black Friday and the weekend, Cyber Monday as well. And so overall, we feel very good about how we?re positioned so far through the quarter. We do know that ? and for the most part, that double-digit, low double-digit comp, we?ve seen some buildup in essentials, but it?s been across the board, good with the cocooning, nesting at home trend, and that continues to play out well. And like Jonathan said earlier, the seasonal Christmas shopping or holiday shopping started all the way back in October, [x continued] through and we sold through very well. So, the other categories are contributing.",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16315,Question-and-Answer,"I think as we look at this in the elongated and moderated view towards the rest of the quarter is the fact that COVID-19 is raging out there. There?s government regulations that are coming in place here, people are staying at home more and more. We do believe that?s going to have an impact through the quarter. It?s going to be a tough quarter for many folks.",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16316,Question-and-Answer,"We?re going to do our best to continue to serve our customer on her terms, especially with a really well built omni-channel offering at this point. But when we look at it, we do expect some moderation in the form of traffic to start to decline a bit, and we?ll be comping highly promotional activity from last year with friends and family events that we won?t have this year, but we?ll allow her discounts to shop on her terms. But we do expect there will be moderation, and we want to go at it realistically.",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16317,Question-and-Answer,"Thanks. That?s helpful. And then as a follow-up question, could you give an update on where the easy leasing penetration stands? And just in general, if you could provide any commentary on how that offering has performed, that would be helpful? Thanks.",Jason Haas,4393052
,,,,
16318,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, we?ve got great partners with progressive on easy leasing, and it continues to be a service that our customer enjoys. It allows her to live big, save lots. This year, early on, with the stimulus package, she did not require as much as prior years. I think we recalled high double-digit-teens and past penetration that came down slightly in the first half of the year, it still remains down for the most part. But we expect as we get post-COVID, those numbers and that penetration level will increase again.",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16319,Question-and-Answer,That?s really helpful. Thank you.,Jason Haas,4393052
,,,,
16320,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. Our next question is coming from Brad Thomas from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now live.,Operator,4393052
,,,,
16321,Question-and-Answer,"Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Want to follow-up on some of the topic of promotions. I think for Cyber Monday, you guys ticked up the promotion a bit from the last year. It was 25% off this year versus 20% last year. I guess I was hoping to just think about, is that just sort of unique for the online offering, or how are you thinking about promotions in general, going forward, obviously with the understanding that you had been dialing them back over the past six months or so? Thanks.",Brad Thomas,4393052
,,,,
16322,Question-and-Answer,"Go ahead, Jonathan.",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16323,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. Hey, Brad. I?ll take that one and Bruce wants to add on. Yes. I mean, generally speaking, you?re absolutely right. We?ve been less promotional and has broadly been the case through Q4 as well. And the Cyber Monday promo was probably a bit of an exception on that front, but it?s a unique day and we thought it was appropriate to do that on that day, but generally, our intensity has been less, and it will remain less in Q4.",Jonathan Ramsden,4393052
,,,,
16324,Question-and-Answer,"And then on top of that, we are working to be more effective in how we deploy markdowns and promotions. We think there?s some opportunity over time there with some new tools that we?re working to roll out that will help us on that front. But yes, broadly speaking, we?ve been less promotional. We?ve needed to be less promotional and to some degree because of the way the shopping patterns have changed. And we weren?t comfortable running our whole house weekend, friends and family events. We?ve spread some of those promotions out a bit. But overall, as we called out the last couple of quarters, it?s been less intense and we expect it to remain so certainly this quarter and into Q1.",Jonathan Ramsden,4393052
,,,,
16325,Question-and-Answer,,Jonathan Ramsden,4393052
,,,,
16326,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. And I?ll just add that to the tail part of what Jonathan said there, Jack Pestello, the team, we?re all looking at this from how do we get in and out of sets better, how do we get in out of promos better? What should they look like? I mean, sometimes when you have these high-low sales over weekends, not just in a normal time, not with COVID, it?s hard work on customers. It?s hard work on the company as well.",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16327,Question-and-Answer,"So, how do we buy better, allocate better, sell better and make it less friction in the process and be much more productive and customers be much more happier in the way. As we lean in to closeouts that becomes an easier value proposition, as well as own brands. And so, we?ve learned a lot through 2020 in terms of how we can be much more effective in promotional cadence. We?ll be applying those learnings into 2021.",Bruce Thorn,4393052
,,,,
16328,Question-and-Answer,Great. Thank you so much.,Brad Thomas,4393052

16344,Presentation,"Johnston & Murphy enjoys a strong strategic position with great heritage as well. However, the pandemic has hit J&M's dressier competitive space harder, extending the time frame for turning this business around.",Mimi Vaughn,4393040
,,,,
16345,Presentation,"All-in-all, our teams executed with excellence, managing their businesses well as they reacted to rapidly changing dynamics during the quarter. In the U.S., there was nothing normal about the cadence of back-to-school. The selling season that's usually marked by a sharp acceleration in weekly sales starting in late July and running through Labor Day did not pack the punch that it usually does as school districts across the country delayed or suspended the return to in-person learning. As we expected, we did see an extension of the selling season through September and into October. However, in total, back-to-school was down year-over-year and more heavily tilted to online.",Mimi Vaughn,4393040
,,,,
16346,Presentation,"Meanwhile, back-to-school timing in the UK was consistent with historical patterns but far more consumers shopped online for their school needs than ever before. Stores were open for about 95% of the possible days in the quarter compared to about 70% during the second quarter. While we continue to face traffic levels that are down well into the double-digits, our store teams are driving record levels of consumer conversion that helps to materially offset this headwind.",Mimi Vaughn,4393040
,,,,
16347,Presentation,"Our businesses online, on the other hand, experienced strong gains in both traffic and conversion. We've said before, our e-commerce sales were nicely profitable prior to the pandemic. And as we reap the benefits of the many investments we've made, e-comm is driving even greater profitability.",Mimi Vaughn,4393040
,,,,
16348,Presentation,"New customers continued to deliver increased volumes as new website visitors were up almost 40%, driving an almost 60% in new customer purchases. The combination of these drivers led to a total revenue decrease of 11% year-over-year. This result was better than we expected due mainly to stronger sales at Journeys and represents a meaningful improvement from last quarter's 20% decline. The drop in store volume was partially offset by another strong quarter of digital growth with comps up over 60%. Thanks to decisive cost-cutting actions early in the outbreak, along with one-time benefits such as rent abatements, total expenses were down a little more than revenue. While gross margins were down compared to last year, due primarily to lower margins at J&M and a mix shift among our businesses, the drop improved sequentially from the second quarter as less promotional activity at Schuh would necessary and Journeys' gross margins increased.",Mimi Vaughn,4393040
,,,,
16349,Presentation,"With sales and gross margin improving over last quarter, combined with increased profitability in our e-comm channel, our bottom-line swung solidly back into positive territory.",Mimi Vaughn,4393040
,,,,
16350,Presentation,"The return to profitability fueled positive operating cash generation in the quarter. Equally encouraging was the health of our inventories, which were down more than 20%, allowing for fresh receipts of holiday merchandise.",Mimi Vaughn,4393040
,,,,
16351,Presentation,"In addition, the significant effort we invested with our landlord partners seeking rent abatements during the time our stores were closed paid dividends and will bring even greater benefit next quarter. We appreciate our landlord partners? willingness to find mutually beneficial solutions and hope to expeditiously reach conclusion with those discussions we have not yet concluded.",Mimi Vaughn,4393040
,,,,
16352,Presentation,"So turning now to discuss each business in more detail. Journeys' third quarter results are influenced heavily by back-to-school with more than two-thirds of elementary, middle and high school students attending school only virtually to begin the year, the quarter got off to a difficult start.",Mimi Vaughn,4393040
,,,,
16353,Presentation,"Same-store sales were down double-digits in August, although e-commerce remains strong. The business had an inflection point in early September as comparisons began to ease, accelerated significantly over the remainder of the month and remained strong in October as we captured our fair share of late back-to-school demand.",Mimi Vaughn,4393040
,,,,
16354,Presentation,,Mimi Vaughn,4393040
,,,,
16355,Presentation,"While we were not able to fully make up for the lost volume in August, we were encouraged that store comps were nicely positive in both September and October, and e-commerce growth was even stronger than earlier in the quarter. Comfort continued to be the fashion choice of the pandemic and Journeys offering of casual product resonated strongly with consumers. While teens always have a big complement of fashion athletic footwear in their closets, when fashion swings toward non-athletic or what we call casual footwear, Journeys is especially well positioned among its competition to deliver this assortment. This spring a range of comfortable sandals and other casual products sold through well. This fall, our consumers' appetite for boots began early and more robustly in the season than we have seen in many years.",Mimi Vaughn,4393040
,,,,
16356,Presentation,"While the casual part of Journeys' assortment has been gaining ground over fashion athletic all year, Q3 delivered the largest quarterly growth so far. These gains have been especially pronounced in women's and kids as we've seen throughout the year.",Mimi Vaughn,4393040
,,,,
16357,Presentation,"On the other side of the Atlantic, back-to-school at Schuh unfolded similarly to previous years with schools starting on time and most students returning to in-person learning. However, in terms of consumer digital behavior, it was more extreme as significantly more back-to-school spending shifted online in the UK. With its best-in-class digital capabilities, Schuh was ideally positioned to capitalize on this digital shift and capture the vast majority of lost store volume through digital sales. ",Mimi Vaughn,4393040
,,,,
16358,Presentation,"E-commerce generated almost 45% of Schuh's sales in the quarter, even with most stores being open. While store traffic was still down considerably, back-to-school gave consumers a reason to shop and helped drive traffic increases -- decreases to less negative levels. The blend of better store and much better online sales allowed Schuh to gain market share during the quarter.",Mimi Vaughn,4393040
,,,,
16359,Presentation,"With positive comps in total and only a slight decline in year-over-year revenue from closed stores, coupled with cost savings, Schuh delivered a solid year-over-year operating profit increase. A noteworthy achievement under difficult conditions.",Mimi Vaughn,4393040
,,,,
16360,Presentation,"With less competitive discounting pressure and more scarcity in supply of the brands itself, Schuh pulled back significantly on promotional activity versus the second quarter which helped performance as well. Like Journeys, Schuh's casual assortment gained ground over its fashion athletic assortment with boot sales driving a good portion of the pickup.",Mimi Vaughn,4393040
,,,,
16361,Presentation,"While performance improved from the second to the third quarter with the introduction of its fall assortment, Johnston & Murphy continues to find itself in a tough environment. Its customer has fewer reasons to shop with many continuing to work from home and most large social gatherings and events postponed or canceled. In addition to store traffic being down over 50% for the quarter, some of J&M's airport and street locations have yet to reopen, which further impacted retail sales. A bright spot was boot sales, which began selling earlier in the season this year.",Mimi Vaughn,4393040
,,,,
16362,Presentation,"While J&M historically has been known for its dressier product, the team initiated work years ago to evolve Johnston & Murphy into a full lifestyle brand with a range of footwear and apparel offerings from dressier to more casual. Highlighting the traction we've already made, casual and casual athletic represented about 60% of footwear during our last fiscal year and apparel and accessories drove 40% of total sales.",Mimi Vaughn,4393040
,,,,
16363,Presentation,"Looking forward to the coming year, J&M has focused 90% of new product development on the expansion of its casual offering to include casual athletic, leisure, rugged outdoor and performance, which follows upon its highly successful reentry into Gulf this spring.",Mimi Vaughn,4393040
,,,,
16364,Presentation,,Mimi Vaughn,4393040
,,,,
16365,Presentation,"Leading these efforts is the new Head of Product Development, who joined J&M earlier this year and brings a successful track record developing casual brands. As the J&M customer returns to work and socializing, which we hope with the recent medical advances will be sooner than later, J&M's assortment will be ready for the post-pandemic lifestyle. ",Mimi Vaughn,4393040
,,,,
16366,Presentation,"So turning now to the current quarter. We believe we have the right assortments and are ready for this holiday season. That said, consumer demand has been very different this year due to the pandemic and its impact on consumer behavior and the economy, which has caused us to take a conservative approach to our outlook.",Mimi Vaughn,4393040
,,,,
16367,Presentation,"In November, we faced headwinds from the reclosure of stores in North America and the UK as we carefully monitor and adhere to each country?s and region?s health requirements. And as a result, we're closed for more than 10% of the possible operating days in the month. The biggest impact was in England and Ireland, where we had the best potential to make up some of these sales online and most stores have reopened at this time.",Mimi Vaughn,4393040
,,,,
16368,Presentation,"Following strong gains in September and October, sales moderated and November got off to a slower start against robust comparisons a year ago. We were encouraged to see trends improve quite a bit around mid-month, providing the business with good momentum heading into Black Friday. For the Black Friday weekend itself, as expected, traffic was more subdued than usual. In spite of the choppiness, November sales were in line with our expectations with an even heavier mix of digital versus store sales. Unlike prior years, most retail venues and almost all of our stores were closed on Thanksgiving Day.",Mimi Vaughn,4393040
,,,,
16369,Presentation,"The lion's share of the holiday season remains ahead of us. Outside of Cyber Week, digital sales are normally strongest during the earlier part of December. Our holiday store volume is typically concentrated in peak days and weeks between Thanksgiving and Christmas and bills as the month progresses. Whenever and however the consumer decides to shop, we believe we're set up well to meet the demand, thanks to investments we've made in technology to drive growth across e-commerce and in our stores.",Mimi Vaughn,4393040
,,,,
16370,Presentation,"With recent investments across mobile, our platforms, our websites and our distribution centers, we're prepared to handle what we anticipate will be record holiday digital volumes. We've helped the customer adjust to the pandemic online by introducing services like Klarna at Journeys this summer, which is a pay in 4 installment option that is driving much larger transaction size and offering technology on our website that helps customers determine what size is best to order.",Mimi Vaughn,4393040
,,,,
16371,Presentation,"With the ability to fulfill online orders via our distribution centers or from any of our almost 1,500 store locations, we're well positioned to meet the surge in demand. Earlier this year, we upgraded our inventory locating an order brokering system to provide greater inventory accuracy, which is critical during this peak sales period. This system also allows functionality such as tiering stores to protect inventory in our highest volume stores, enabling us to better optimize sales across our network. Even with the acceleration in online demand, the majority of holiday sales will still take place in our physical locations. Our stores become even greater strategic assets as we get closer to Christmas and customers don't want to risk online orders not arriving in time.",Mimi Vaughn,4393040
,,,,
16372,Presentation,"This is the first year we'll have holiday comparison data in our workforce management system since we implemented it last year. This technology proved invaluable in managing the unusual traffic patterns during back-to-school and will enable us to rapidly add or remove labor to optimize store staffing levels during this unusual holiday season. Thanks in part to changes in our compensation programs this year, we've reduced turnover meaningfully and have a more tenured, more experienced workforce on our sales for holiday, ready to provide excellent customer service we're known for. This holiday will be about execution, something we do well that will differentiate us among others.",Mimi Vaughn,4393040

16373,Presentation,,Mimi Vaughn,4393040
,,,,
16374,Presentation,"We've also developed some terrific marketing campaigns, adjusted for what we?ve learned during the pandemic to drive traffic and sales in this important holiday selling season. We've increased digital marketing spend substantially and are leveraging our CRM systems to inform our digital, social and other advertising efforts. ",Mimi Vaughn,4393040
,,,,
16375,Presentation,"So thanks to our competitive strengths, we've navigated well through extraordinary market conditions this year, including back-to-school and back to work uncertainty and we'll continue to navigate through this unusual holiday season. As conditions normalize and we make further progress on our strategic initiatives, I am confident we'll emerge strong and be well positioned with more than enough liquidity to take advantage of the many opportunities the pandemic has presented.",Mimi Vaughn,4393040

We appreciate your efforts all year round, but really especially in this busy holiday season in the midst of the pandemic, when I'm certain you'll go the extra mile to delight our customers.

,,,,
16379,Presentation,"Thank you, Mimi. We were very pleased under the circumstances with our performance in Q3 and the return to profitability against the backdrop of the pandemic. Q3 sequential improvement compared to the prior 2 quarters in both revenue and gross margin, along with a lower tax rate and a small pickup in SG&A, drove results back to nicely positive levels with adjusted EPS of $0.85 compared to $1.33 last year.",Dave Slater ,4393040

16380,Presentation,"For the third quarter, ending cash was $115 million, with borrowings of $33 million for a net cash position of $82 million. Just a little below second quarter's levels. We ended the quarter with $299 million of cash.

,,,,
16384,Presentation,"Turning to the specifics of the quarter. Consolidated revenue was $479 million, down 11% compared to last year, driven by a lower back-to-school revenue, continued pressure at J&M and the impact from store closures during the quarter.",Dave Slater ,4393040
,,,,
16385,Presentation,"Robust e-commerce comp of 62% was offset by a decline in store revenue of 22%, driven by a comp decline of 18%, while our stores were closed for 5% of the possible operating days during the quarter. Digital sales increased to 21% of retail business from 11% last year. Our comp policy removes any stores that are closed for 7 consecutive days. And therefore, we are providing both overall and comp sales by business to give better insight into performance. Overall, sales were down 10% for Journeys with comp sales down 6%, while store traffic was down well into double-digits. Much higher conversion and transaction size lifted Journeys comps.",Dave Slater ,4393040

16386,Presentation,,Dave Slater ,4393040
,,,,
16387,Presentation,"At Schuh, overall sales were down 3%, while sales were up 1%. At J&M, overall sales were down 45%, and comp sales were down 43%. At Licensed Brands, overall sales were up 91% due to Togast acquisition. ",Dave Slater ,4393040
,,,,
16388,Presentation,"Consolidated gross margin was 47.1%, down 210 basis points from last year, 100 basis points of which was related to J&M. Consistent with last quarter, increased shipping to fulfill direct sales pressured the gross margin rate in all of our businesses, totaling 50 basis points of the total overall decline.",Dave Slater ,4393040
,,,,
16389,Presentation,"Journeys' gross margin increased 110 basis points driven by lower markdowns. Schuh's gross margin decreased 320 basis points, more than half of which was due to increased e-comm shipping expense with the balance due to higher penetration of sale product. J&M's gross margin decrease of 1,370 basis points was due to more closeouts at wholesale, incremental inventory reserves and higher markdowns at retail.",Dave Slater ,4393040
,,,,
16390,Presentation,"Finally, the combination of lower revenue at J&M, typically our highest gross margin rate of our businesses and the revenue growth of Licensed Brands, typically our lowest gross margin rate, negatively impacted the overall rate mix. Adjusted SG&A expenses were down 11%; and as a percentage of sales, leveraged 10 basis points to 44.1% as we realized the collective benefits of our organization's disciplined actions to manage expenses and relief from government programs. The largest year-over-year savings came from occupancy costs, driven in large part by the execution of $7 million of rent abatements with our landlord partners, who provided support for the times when stores were closed and savings from the",Dave Slater ,4393040
,,,,
16391,Presentation,"UK government programs, which provides property tax relief. ",Dave Slater ,4393040
,,,,
16392,Presentation,The next largest areas of savings came from bonus expense and the reduction in store selling salaries. Compensation expense benefited from reduced operating hours and government salary relief provided in Canada and the UK.,Dave Slater ,4393040
,,,,
16393,Presentation,"Given the added cost of driving customer traffic to our stores and websites, our organization is intently focused on the strategic initiative of reshaping the cost structure. One of the most impactful areas has been a multiyear effort centered around occupancy costs, and we have achieved even greater traction this year in view of the pandemic.",Dave Slater ,4393040
,,,,
16394,Presentation,"In addition to the rent abatement savings, we have negotiated 58 renewals year-to-date and achieved a 28% reduction in cash rent or 27% on a straight-line basis in the U.S., this was on top of an 11% cash rent reduction or 8% on a straight-line basis for 160 renewals last year. These renewals are for an even shorter-term, averaging approximately 1.5 years compared to the 3-year average we saw last year. With almost a third of our fleet coming up for renewal in the next 24 months, we should make substantial progress here.",Dave Slater ,4393040
,,,,
16395,Presentation,"In summary, the third quarter's adjusted operating income was $13.9 million versus last year's adjusted operating income of $26.7 million. Both Schuh and Licensed Brands generated operating income increases over last year, while Journeys was lower and J&M saw the largest year-over-year decline. Our adjusted non-GAAP tax rate for the third quarter was 4%, reflecting the impact of foreign jurisdictions for which no income taxes were recorded.",Dave Slater ,4393040
,,,,
16396,Presentation,"Turning now to the balance sheet. Q3 total inventory was down 22% on sales that were down 11%. Journeys' inventory was down 28% on sales that were down 10%. Schuh's inventory was down 22% with sales that were down 8% on a constant currency basis. Both Journeys and Schuh will continue to chase inventory during Q4, adding fresh merchandise to increase these levels.",Dave Slater ,4393040
,,,,
16397,Presentation,"J&M's inventory was down 3% on sales that were down 45%, reflecting the pack-and-hold inventory and the level of reserves we believe will be adequate to better right-size the current inventory levels.",Dave Slater ,4393040
,,,,
16398,Presentation,,Dave Slater ,4393040
,,,,
16399,Presentation,Capital expenditures were $8 million as we -- as our spend remains focused on digital and omnichannel and depreciation and amortization was $11 million. We closed 7 stores and opened 7 during the quarter. ,Dave Slater ,4393040
,,,,
16400,Presentation,"Given the continued uncertainty due to the pandemic, we are not providing guidance this quarter but will share some current thoughts on the business going forward. Q4 revenue usually is dependent upon performing well during what are traditionally the peak volume times of the holiday season. This year, we are more conservative about those consumer peaks materializing. Therefore, thinking about revenue, the year-over-year percentage decline in overall sales in the fourth quarter could be just a little bit more than the decline in the third quarter as a result of this. That said, if consumer demand is stronger during the peaks, we believe we are well-positioned to capture our fair share, which would result in us exceeding these levels. This does not contemplate any additional store closures or restrictions beyond what we know today, which could be a bigger headwind.",Dave Slater ,4393040
,,,,
16401,Presentation,"For the month of November, stores were open for about 88% of the possible operating days, and currently, 97% of our stores are open. Stores have also been operating on more limited hours. Gross margin rates versus last year for Q4 should be in the range of the decrease we saw in Q3. The Q3 headwinds of higher e-commerce penetration, J&M gross margin pressure and the negative impact from the mix of businesses we expect will persist into Q4. We expect SG&A in Q4 to leverage quite a bit from last year's levels, as we continue to benefit from ongoing cost reduction efforts and get some substantial help from rent abatements. While the annual tax rate is expected to be approximately 18%, I'd like to highlight that in the fourth quarter, we expect it to be approximately 40%.",Dave Slater ,4393040
,,,,
16402,Presentation,"In conclusion, I would like to echo Mimi's comments on our amazing team, who have executed so admirably throughout this entire year. From store closings and reopenings through an unprecedented back-to-school season and now in the middle of the most important holiday season, the talent and perseverance shown during this challenging year leaves me with much to be admired and appreciated.",Dave Slater ,4393040

16403,Presentation,"This completes our prepared remarks. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions.",Dave Slater ,4393040
,,,,
16404,Question-and-Answer,[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steve Marotta with CL King.,Operator,4393040
,,,,
16405,Question-and-Answer,"Congratulations on the perfect execution in the third quarter. I've got a couple of questions. And you've probably already incorporated this into what was the cursory fourth quarter guidance. But as far as increased shipping costs go during these peak weeks, can you talk a little bit about how that's affecting the margin, if you could potentially quantify that? Or maybe you're avoiding it in some fashion. If you could talk to that cost specifically, that would be helpful.",Steve Marotta ,4393040
,,,,
16406,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. Let me sort of just start talking about our overall relationship because we spent a lot of time focused on making sure that we could not only have enough shipping capacity. I know there's been a lot of conversation out there about various retailers hitting capacity limits. But we work with Federal Express, and we actually changed over to a Federal Express relationship a number of years ago. And it's been really positive. We are not concerned about hitting any caps. We indicated what volume we thought we would hit early -- very early in the fall. And so far we've been executing well against that. And certainly, we do have more shipping expense within our P&L because our digital penetration is so high. But part of what we are seeing is that we are increasingly more profitable because we're amortizing the fixed expenses of digital.",Mimi Vaughn ,4393040
,,,,
16407,Question-and-Answer,,Mimi Vaughn ,4393040
,,,,
16408,Question-and-Answer,"If we look at our last quarter, we more than doubled our e-commerce profitability because of that. And so we were in the good position to have the operating positive e-commerce economics prior to the pandemic and what the pandemic has done has only enhanced our ability to gain profits out of this channel.",Mimi Vaughn ,4393040
,,,,
16409,Question-and-Answer,"Dave, I don't know if you'd add anything to that.",Mimi Vaughn ,4393040
,,,,
16410,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. I would say that, Steve, we're not likely to quantify the impact -- the expected impact in Q4, but that is definitely something that will pressure our margin rate as we head into the holiday season.",Dave Slater ,4393040
,,,,
16411,Question-and-Answer,Yes. It was 50 basis points in the third quarter. So we'll expect that it's -- the penetration quite be as high in the fourth quarter because penetration is usually higher anyway.,Mimi Vaughn ,4393040
,,,,
16412,Question-and-Answer,"That's very helpful. Looking ahead to the next back-to-school season, you mentioned currently that comfort and casual are working well, that is a huge surprise. Given how different this season is, is it possible -- you don't have to tell me what they are, but is it possible to glean any changes or potential future changes in consumer fashion preferences that can be applied to next year and next back-to-school season? Or is there so much noise that it's simply impossible?",Steve Marotta ,4393040
,,,,
16413,Question-and-Answer,"Well, there's definitely a lot of noise, and I think that that's going to be the case for some time to come. I talked a bit about it in our prepared remarks that our teen is known for going through fashion cycles. And over the years, we've talked about lots of different fashion cycles from surf to skate to more gothic to you name it. And teens are constantly seeking something new. Our latest cycle that we've been talking about has been the retro athletic cycle, and that's been a terrific cycle because there are lots of brands that have fantastic silhouettes in their portfolios that they've been able to pull out. We saw earlier this year a bigger shift into casual and we really define our world in terms of fashion athletic and casual. And this year, we saw that sandals were really popular. Our kids are always wearing fashion athletic shoes. But the pandemic steered everybody to wear comfort and our teens found lots of nice products within the casual side of our assortment. We saw that not only in the summer, but we saw early boot sales in the fall. And so the combination of sandals and boots has put our casual as a percentage of our overall business at a much higher level. ",Mimi Vaughn ,4393040
,,,,
16414,Question-and-Answer,"And so will that stick? We'll see. But typically, our teen consumers jumps on a trend, stays on that trend for a bit. And we typically have a fairly good sense as to opportunity and upside. And we see that we've got some nice upside in that casual trend. Journeys and Schuh are both uniquely positioned among competition out there. We're in a great position where we can offer both fashion athletic and casual, and we will move toward whatever brands are most popular with our kids.",Mimi Vaughn ,4393040
,,,,
16415,Question-and-Answer,Next question is from the line of Janine Stichter with Jefferies.,Operator,4393040
,,,,
16416,Question-and-Answer,"I wanted to ask a little bit more about digital. Maybe talk a little bit about some of the omnichannel investments you've been making over the years, and how those stand to benefit you for holiday? And then if you could just remind us by brand where your digital penetration fits and where you see the most opportunity?",Janine Stichter ,4393040
,,,,
16417,Question-and-Answer,"Great. So we've had a lot of success with our digital strategy this year. Last quarter, we were up 144%. This quarter, we were up over 60%. Over the last many years, we've been growing at a 15% rate. But last year, we said we have an intent to grow digital even to a greater level, and we're growing at a 20% rate. So we've invested across a number of areas. It's not just the front end systems, but it's really important to be able to have the right tools to drive traffic and to encourage conversion. It's important to be investing in the infrastructure, in the order management systems. I talked a little bit about the upgrade we did to our inventory locating systems. It's important to be investing within our distribution centers, and we've made quite significant investments over the last few years in both the Journeys and Schuh's distribution centers. We put in a bespoke e-commerce picking module into Journeys last year. We will be putting in another bespoke -- another one of those modules in the coming year. We're going to actually start work on that early in our next fiscal year. And so you roll all of that -- and payment is another place. Payment is another opportunity. So it's no one thing. It's no one silver bullet that allows digital to be successful, but it's investment across all of those areas, and our teams have been focused on each one of those.",Mimi Vaughn ,4393040
,,,,
16418,Question-and-Answer,,Mimi Vaughn ,4393040

16419,Question-and-Answer,"Our digital penetration by brand is the highest at Schuh pre-pandemic, and it's important to talk about pre-pandemic because the pandemic has made comparisons challenging with opening and store closings. But pre-pandemic, Schuh's digital penetration was over 25%. And this last quarter, digital was almost 50% of their business with stores -- with some stores closed, followed by Johnston & Murphy. The Johnson & Murphy customer likes shopping online, likes taking advantage of perhaps not having to go into a retail venue. And then Journeys follows up after that. And I think that perhaps we've seen just -- we've seen high-growth rates of new customers in both Journeys and Schuh throughout the pandemic. I think there is likely the largest opportunity in those businesses.",Mimi Vaughn ,4393040
,,,,
16420,Question-and-Answer,Our next question is from the line of Jonathan Komp with Baird.,Operator,4393040
,,,,
16421,Question-and-Answer,"First, I just want to ask about the fourth quarter and the commentary you gave. When we think about the trends to-date in November being in line with your expectations, is that signaling you're projecting forward a similar trend that you've seen in terms of top-line growth? Or are you expecting to change during the balance of the quarter?",Jonathan Komp ,4393040
,,,,
16422,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. So Jon, we talked a bit about this, but what we have been seeing is an unusual set of behavior. In the back-to-school time period, we typically have spikes early on during back-to-school. And then it trails off in September. We didn't see those spikes this year, but we saw really nice spikes in September and into October. We have also been seeing the consumer choosing to shop during the week and more so than on the weekend. And so what we saw -- and what we saw over Black Friday is that consumers shopped a lot in the week prior to Black Friday. The traffic overall was more subdued, and it was more subdued both in stores and then even on Cyber Monday because there had been so much shopping pulled earlier and pulled forward. And we expect that that's going to happen through the course of the holiday season. And so we have a number of really peak days such as the Saturday before Christmas, Black Friday is typically one of them. And what we expect to see is something similar to what we saw at back-to-school where the peaks are not quite as high, but that the valley is get filled in. And so we are expecting -- we added all of that up together. And in our forecast said that let's take a little bit off the peak, so let's fill in some of the valleys and came up with something that was fairly similar to where we had been in the third quarter with hopefully more of our stores staying open. ",Mimi Vaughn ,4393040
,,,,
16423,Question-and-Answer,"I think one of the key things to point out is that it's going to be more online-oriented, and we expect that volumes are going to build in stores as we get closer to Christmas. And so if consumers shop more robustly during those peaks, then it will be higher than what we have laid out. But if the peaks are more subdued as we're expecting, and that's where we think we will end up. Dave, would you add anything to that?",Mimi Vaughn ,4393040
,,,,
16424,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. As Mimi indicated, November came in pretty close to where we thought it would be, and that included the impact of the COVID-related closures we saw mainly in the UK and Thanksgiving Day being closed in -- virtually in all locations in the U.S. So we said that we would expect Q4 sales to decline just a little bit more than we saw in Q3, the 11% we saw in Q3. And when I say a little bit more, I mean a couple of percentage points more. And as Mimi indicated, our focus has really been around the peak days, and we're being conservative on the peaks. And -- but if traffic comes in better during those peak times, then our sales will be better. So that's really our outlook right now.",Dave Slater ,4393040
,,,,
16425,Question-and-Answer,,Mimi Vaughn,4393040
,,,,
16426,Question-and-Answer,"And if we get stimulus, then that will be more than enough icing on the cake. And so lots of challenges but also lots of opportunity in the coming holiday season.",Mimi Vaughn,4393040
,,,,
16427,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, that's really helpful. And maybe then a question on SG&A. Just it sounded like for the fourth quarter, you're signaling more leverage potential even on potentially slightly greater sales declines. I just want to understand that. And maybe more broadly on the cost structure going into next year. I think it's helpful in your COVID-related adjustment table. In the press release, I think it calls out more than $20 million year-to-date of savings from property tax relief and rent abatements. And just want to ask how you're thinking about the ability to overcome that headwind next year that as presumably those costs come back in?",Jonathan Komp ,4393040
,,,,
16428,Question-and-Answer,"Great. Yes, why don't you start with the SG&A and then maybe I'll jump in on the -- on some costs -- start on the cost structure. I'll jump on that.",Mimi Vaughn ,4393040
,,,,
16429,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, absolutely. So to first address, Jon, your question on the COVID table and the relief that we have or the items that we list on there related to property tax relief and rent abatements. And how I think about rent abatements, it's more of a timing issue than it is of actual savings because we ended up booking full rent in the -- earlier in the year. And now we're just getting savings for when our stores were closed. So when stores are opened next year, then the economics should play out accordingly. The UK property tax relief, again, is similar. We're getting that relief because our stores were closed and as stores will reopen next year, we should be able to overcome the costs as they come back into our business. And just as overall thoughts on SG&A and why we think we can leverage in Q4, we've -- we're benefiting from a lot of the collective efforts that we took early on in the pandemic around our cost structure. And many of those will continue into the fourth quarter. I would say the largest opportunity is going to come from the rent abatements that we are coming to a conclusion with many of our landlords. And what we think is that could be more than double the amount that -- of the $7 million that we recognized in Q3, and we really expect our SG&A to leverage quite a bit from last year's levels, even on the lower sales volumes that we expect because of this. And it could be as much as 100 basis points depending on the level of our revenue in the quarter.",Dave Slater ,4393040
,,,,
16430,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. So just to chime in a bit on the cost structure and the reshaping of the cost structure. I think Dave pointed out -- good job pointed out how much rent relief we have gotten outside of these abatements, and that's through the course of the normal renegotiations. And Jon, we've talked for a number of years about how on the renewals that we have been executing that we have seen rent reductions in the neighborhood of 8% to 10%. But it's stepped up pretty significantly through the course of the pandemic, and I think that, that is some acknowledgment of the fact that traffic has been down, and we're having to spend more marketing dollars to be able to drive traffic to stores and to our website. So that certainly helps the cause. ",Mimi Vaughn ,4393040
,,,,
16431,Question-and-Answer,"And I do think as far as cost structure grows, that the growth of our e-comm channel and the size and the scale will help profitability. There's a lot of investment required upfront but all the way along to grow e-commerce. And the more size and scale that you can get, the better the economics end up being. And so that, coupled with some of the rent savings and the cost reductions on the store side should add up to a positive economic formula.",Mimi Vaughn ,4393040
,,,,
16432,Question-and-Answer,The next question is from the line of Sam Poser with Susquehanna.,Operator,4393040
,,,,
16433,Question-and-Answer,,Sam Poser ,4393040
,,,,
16434,Question-and-Answer,"I just want to know -- a few just follow-ups. The question was asked what your digital penetration was by banner -- by business. You talked about -- you gave the number for Schuh, but you did not give specifics for Journeys and Johnston & Murphy. Please do.",Sam Poser ,4393040
,,,,
16435,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, sure. So Johnston & Murphy it was in the range of 20% and Journeys was less than 10% last year. All of our businesses this year, their digital penetration has been higher. And Dave, I think you've got the number for the -- maybe talk about the second and the third quarters.",Mimi Vaughn ,4393040
,,,,
16436,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. Obviously, Sam, with stores closed for portions of both -- for all the quarters this year, our digital penetration is swung wildly higher. But for the third quarter, Journeys was up almost double of their digital penetration versus last year.",Dave Slater ,4393040
,,,,
16437,Question-and-Answer,So around -- could you just give us what the numbers are?,Sam Poser ,4393040
,,,,
16438,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. So last year, in Q3, the digital penetration at Journeys was 7 -- I'm sorry, yes, the digital penetration was 7%. And this year in Q3, it was nearly 14%. And for Schuh, last year, it was 24% and this year it was 43%, so almost doubling. For Johnston & Murphy, last year it was 18%, and this year it was almost 34%. So big swings this year over last.",Dave Slater ,4393040
,,,,
16439,Question-and-Answer,"And also those businesses grew nicely. So when you think about just the revenue increase in the digital and once the stores are fully reopened and traffic sort of improves, how sticky do you think you'll be able to -- how sticky do you think your e-commerce revenue will be?",Sam Poser ,4393040
,,,,
16440,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. Look, we think that the consumer has tried a lot as far as digital goes this year, and they've liked what they've seen and they've really liked the experiences that they've had. And I will give a huge shout out to our teams for the ability to execute on some of these levels. Because in Schuh, for example, last quarter, e-comm penetration was 70%; and in Journeys, it was 20%. And to be able to do -- and the growth rates were almost -- they almost tripled their businesses. And to be able to do that and execute well against that and get very high customer satisfaction scores is a good testament to our abilities there. And so I think that much of that will stick.",Mimi Vaughn ,4393040
,,,,
16441,Question-and-Answer,"At the same time, our teen likes coming into our stores, and we saw that our digital penetration went down well from the time that -- from the second to the third quarter because consumers have those options. So the way we're thinking about the world going forward, Sam, is, however, our consumers want to shop with us, we're going to have terrific experiences within the stores and great experiences on our websites, and the consumer will go back and forth seamlessly across the two of them.",Mimi Vaughn ,4393040
,,,,
16442,Question-and-Answer,"I've got a handful of other questions. Number one, you mentioned you had new -- you mentioned the level of new customers to your website. But if you think about it, again, by banner, how many new customers, especially Schuh and Journeys, how many new customers were new, not only to the website maybe but also just new to Schuh or Journeys?",Sam Poser ,4393040
,,,,
16443,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. Look, I think we were measuring the website just because there's been such up and down in terms of overall closings of stores, Sam. So I think that it's just an unusual time for measuring stores because we've got the pandemic going on and customers -- some customers may be reluctant to go ahead and shop within stores. And so that's why we are really focused on our websites. And the exciting thing about the websites is that you could type anything into your URL and consumers are choosing to come and shop with our concepts. And what we saw is, I called out a 40% increase in new website visitors. And it was pretty equal between Journeys and Schuh. Johnston & Murphy, of course, is a bit less just because of where they're situated from a fashion point of view. And new customers were -- drove a large percentage of purchases and were almost 45% of our overall online sales. And so we take those new customers, we plug them into our CRM systems. We do a lot of work for specific programs and specific journeys to try to get them to purchase again. And the key to getting stickiness is to have the customers have a great experience, have them come back and shop with you again and then encourage additional purchases. And after a certain number of purchases, we can say that those are -- we can define them then as loyal customers.",Mimi Vaughn ,4393040
,,,,
16444,Question-and-Answer,,Mimi Vaughn ,4393040
,,,,
16445,Question-and-Answer,Our next question comes from the line of Mitch Kummetz with Pivotal Research.,Operator,4393040
,,,,
16446,Question-and-Answer,"I've got a few questions of my own. So let me start -- and if Tom George is on the call or in the building, welcome Tom. It's been a while. So let me start with the fourth quarter outlook. So you expect it to be down more than Q3, although it sounds like maybe only by a couple of points. And I get what you're saying about the peaks and valleys, but I'm wondering if the main reason for Q4 likely to be weaker than Q3 in terms of the growth rate is more about the store open days that there are fewer store open days in Q4 than Q3? Or is it more about the peaks and the valleys, at least as it kind of relates to the difference between Q3?",Mitch Kummetz ,4393040
,,,,
16447,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. So look, I think that the -- what I would say is that above anything else, that there's just a lot going on in the overall atmosphere. The consumer has been resilient throughout the year. And so there are also a whole lot of tailwinds. The consumer has been saving so that they've got disposable income. There's lots of indications of that. There's not a lot of spending on travel and entertainment, holiday parties and other things. And look, our brands are really -- and our footwear is really desired by teams at Christmas. It's just a big gift-giving item. So, we're very optimistic that we've got the right merchandise and that we can execute when traffic shows up in our stores. People are going to have a lot of time to shop because they're going to be working from home. And you can run out from home and do some shopping or you can pull up your mobile device and you can shop online as well. ",Mimi Vaughn ,4393040
,,,,
16448,Question-and-Answer,"And so I would say, Mitch, that how we are thinking about it is just with some conservatism. Right now, we have got 97% of our stores opened. Last month, many of our stores were closed. And so we were we were only operating for about 88% of the overall time. December is a much bigger month than November is. And so to the extent that our stores can stay open and operate, then we'll be able to meet the demand. We expect more shopping will be on the weekdays. We've seen this already. We expect more shopping during the non-peak hours. Many malls have been working on reduced hours and have added hours to try to help meet this demand. Lots of people will wait until the last minute. They'll come into our stores really last minute. And so we're being conservative just because of the unusual nature of consumer behavior during the pandemic. But if the consumer comes out and shops in force, then we'll be able to meet the peaks to a greater extent and more like usual.",Mimi Vaughn ,4393040
,,,,
16449,Question-and-Answer,"And given the challenges around the peaks, especially to the extent that Europe's store capacity may be limited around some of those really big days, what are you dealing, if anything proactively, to kind of stretch that out and make the valleys better? I mean I know that some of that's just happening organically. But to what extent are you trying to steer that in order to soften the impact of the lower peaks? And then I have a final question.",Mitch Kummetz,4393040
,,,,
16450,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. Sure. So we are definitely using our promotional posture to be able to steer the consumer into various times. So for example, Journeys typically launches their sale, both in stores and online, the week of Black Friday. And it's a great opportunity to just take advantage of traffic. And in fact, they launched the week before this year, and we're really successful driving customers both to the stores and to online, which relieved some of the pressure on Black Friday weekend itself. And so interestingly, we saw a lot of nice pickup in volume prior to Black Friday. Black Friday weekend itself was more subdued. Of course, the stores were closed on Thanksgiving. And then we saw a nice pickup afterward. And so all of our marketing, all of our messaging, all of, quite frankly, retail marketing and messaging is about shop early, think about how to avoid the peak times, make sure you get your shopping in. And we feel like people are going to be in a gift-giving spirit. It's a nice relief from some of what has been the monotony of the pandemic. And so there may be some real opportunity here. And the consumer is doing this themselves. I mean they are smart, they're figuring out when our less busy times within the malls and within shopping venues and will come in and will either pick up merchandise quickly without trying it on and take it home and try it on, or they will choose to try it on within our stores and purchase at that time. But we've seen a lot higher conversion. Conversion has been at the highest levels we've seen. There's a lot of intent to purchase even with traffic down, we can have positive comps. ",Mimi Vaughn ,4393040
,,,,
16451,Question-and-Answer,,Mimi Vaughn ,4393040
,,,,
16452,Question-and-Answer,"In Journeys in both September and October, we had positive store comps, and that was on lower traffic because conversion was so strong and transaction size was better. And so you add all of that up, and you say that it's a combination where we can make the numbers work to be able to meet some of the volumes that we had last year.",Mimi Vaughn ,4393040
,,,,
16453,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. And then lastly, on boots. I know that in your comments on the quarter, you mentioned that boot started early. I know that your boot business is driven more by fashion than anything else. But I'm curious if you've seen the boot strength continue into November? Because, I guess, November feels like it's been -- or it was kind of a warm month, and I think your boot business was pretty good in November last year, so maybe a tougher compare. I'm kind of curious how you've seen that continue as you started the fourth quarter?",Mitch Kummetz ,4393040
,,,,
16454,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. You've got a good memory, Mitch. So yes, I mean, boot started early and started really well. And there are a number of big brands that are driving this. And I'll tell you, in the first couple of weeks in November -- last year in November it was super cold, and so boot sales took off. This year in November, we had a lot happening in the first part of the month. The election was going on. Weather got a lot warmer, lots of different distractions. And so just overall traffic, as I mentioned, became more subdued. But then we saw the robust pickup thereafter. And I think that it's mostly fashion that is driving teens? appetite. And I think there's a feeling that they just want something different. They want to change of seasons. They want to be doing something different. And they really like the offerings. A lot of our brands have put out some terrific product, and we have lots of nice allocation of that product, and so that's a winning formula.",Mimi Vaughn ,4393040

,,,,
16468,Presentation,"Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. We would like to thank you for joining us today for our fiscal 2021 third quarter conference call. Conditions in the global marine industry remain challenging due to the lingering impacts of COVID-19 and the growing number of restrictions and regulations that have emerged as a result. However, we continue to make progress and build momentum in both our day-to-day operations, as well as our longer term strategic growth initiatives.",Guy Malden,4393037
,,,,
16469,Presentation,"With that in mind, let me begin by making some general comments about the third quarter. I will then take the opportunity to outline what we consider to be important market trends emerging in the marine industry, how they fit into our future growth plans and what we are doing to capitalize on them.",Guy Malden,4393037
,,,,
16470,Presentation,"Turning now to the third quarter. While COVID-19 negatively impacted our operations due to lingering uncertainty and travel restrictions, the quarter progressed a bit better than we had anticipated.",Guy Malden,4393037
,,,,
16471,Presentation,,Guy Malden,4393037
,,,,
16472,Presentation,"As we mentioned during our second quarter call, our expectation had been that third quarter revenues would be roughly flat -- quarter. However, we managed to achieve nearly a 29% sequential improvement in revenues, despite the restrictive macroeconomic environment.",Guy Malden,4393037
,,,,
16473,Presentation,"As I stated in our previous call, we believe the pandemic and its consequences have weighed heavily on our customers and hampered their willingness to commit to expenditures. Despite that, there still is a healthy level inquiry and bid activity in the marketplace.",Guy Malden,4393037
,,,,
16474,Presentation,"Now, we feel that now is an ideal time to highlight and review our approach to the global marine market since we have recently completed our comprehensive reincorporation and rebranding, and are also in the midst of exiting our legacy seismic land leasing business.",Guy Malden,4393037
,,,,
16475,Presentation,"With these actions either completed or in progress, it?s helpful to review our vision and outline our longer term initiatives for the company, and how we plan to build on the momentum we have established to pursue our identified growth opportunities.",Guy Malden,4393037
,,,,
16476,Presentation,"So, let me start by outlining our target markets before I review the trends that we see developing in those markets and how we plan on leveraging our capabilities to take advantage of the opportunities that these trends provide.",Guy Malden,4393037
,,,,
16477,Presentation,"Now looking at the marine industry, based on our target markets, we provide our technology to three major segments. First, the exploration market, which includes marine seismic exploration and survey activities, conducted to support decision making on engineering and renewable energy projects, as well as oil and gas and other mineral exploration. We estimate its serviceable market size, which is the portion of the market that we can serve with our current and planned products to be roughly $440 million per year.",Guy Malden,4393037
,,,,
16478,Presentation,"Second, the survey market, which is made up of search and recovery activities, as well as hydrographic and construction surveys is estimate to have an annual serviceable market size of about a $150 million.",Guy Malden,4393037
,,,,
16479,Presentation,"And third, the defense market, which is made up of applications such as mine countermeasures and anti-submarine warfare and maritime security is estimated to have a serviceable market size of about $750 million per year. So all told, these three market segments yield a combined estimated serviceable market size of about $1.3 billion a year.",Guy Malden,4393037
,,,,
16480,Presentation,"Now given the size of the opportunities available to us, our goal over the next five years is to grow our annual revenue to $140 million, with EBITDA margins in excess of 20%. We anticipate that most of the growth will be driven organically with the help of our strategic initiatives, which I will address shortly. The remaining balance will be driven by strategic partnerships and acquisitions.",Guy Malden,4393037
,,,,
16481,Presentation,"Now within those three market segments there are certain developing market trends that represent significant growth opportunities for MIND. As we now see it, those trends include the following; first, the proliferation of unmanned or uncrewed marine vehicles, be they surface or underwater vehicles for the commercial and military markets. These are often referred to as unmanned surface vehicles or USVs and autonomous underwater vehicles or AUVs; second, growing customer demand for higher resolution sonar images; and third, the need for alternative technology solutions for anti-submarine warfare and maritime security to counter the growing maritime security concerns such as the rapid acquisition of conventional submarines in regions such as Southeast Asia.",Guy Malden,4393037
,,,,
16482,Presentation,"In order to address these trends and better exploit the opportunities, we have established certain strategic initiatives. For instance, to address the growing market need for uncrewed and/or unmanned vehicles, we have focused on providing sensor packages tailored specifically to these vehicles, enabling customers to obtain a more complete solution and easier integration into their platforms.",Guy Malden,4393037
,,,,
16483,Presentation,,Guy Malden,4393037
,,,,
16484,Presentation,"Similarly, to address the growing customer need for greater resolution sonar imaging, we have recently partnered with a major European defense contractor in a mutually beneficial arrangement to produce Synthetic Aperture Sonar, a type of side scan sonar that can yield much higher resolution images.",Guy Malden,4393037
,,,,
16485,Presentation,"And finally in the area of maritime security, we are applying existing commercially developed technology, such as our solid streamer product to provide more cost effective practical solutions to this developing market.",Guy Malden,4393037
,,,,
16486,Presentation,"Furthermore, our substantial existing production capacity enables us to eliminate a significant barrier to entry and produce these items quickly and economically versus more traditional solutions.",Guy Malden,4393037
,,,,
16487,Presentation,Now initiatives like these play a critical part in the development of our company as we look to expand and add new technology and applications to the marine market. We feel that they are in very natural progression from our existing sonar and seismic capabilities.,Guy Malden,4393037
,,,,
16488,Presentation,"It?s my hope that this discussion has enhanced your understanding of how we plan to leverage our core competencies and utilize existing technologies in new, unique and innovative solutions to expand into new markets.",Guy Malden,4393037
,,,,
16489,Presentation,"Let me now turn the call over to Rob, who will discuss our financial results in more detail and add some closing comments before turning the call over for Q&A.",Guy Malden,4393037
,,,,
16490,Presentation,"Okay. Thanks, Guy. And I will begin by giving a more detailed review of the third quarter financial results. But first let me remind you that our legacy leased operations are classified as discontinued operations and our continuing operations are composed entirely of our Marine Technology Products.",Rob Capps,4393037
,,,,
16491,Presentation,"Revenues from our continuing operations totaled $6.5 million in this quarter, up nearly 29% sequentially from $5.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. You may recall that during the second quarter, we completed a $1.8 million SeaLink related order, but the customer is unable to take delivery at that time due to COVID related transportation issues. As we anticipated, this order was successfully completed during the third quarter.",Rob Capps,4393037
,,,,
16492,Presentation,"Third quarter gross profit from continuing operations was $2.3 million, up from $2 million in Q2. This represents a margin of 35%, which was down from the 40% achieved in the prior quarter. So the decrease in margins were result of higher product testing and sustaining engineering activities during this period.",Rob Capps,4393037
,,,,
16493,Presentation,"Our general and administrative expenses were $3 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2021, which is essentially flat sequentially.",Rob Capps,4393037
,,,,
16494,Presentation,"Our research and development expense was $912,000, up 21% from the second quarter of this year. This increase was mostly due to activity related to our passive sonar array strategic initiative and an included cost associated with the deployment of the test system.",Rob Capps,4393037
,,,,
16495,Presentation,Our overall operating loss from continue operations for the third quarter of this year was $2.3 million. This compared to an operating loss of $2.4 million in the sequential quarter of this year.,Rob Capps,4393037
,,,,
16496,Presentation,"Our third quarter adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was a loss of $1.5 million, which was about flat with Q2 of this year.",Rob Capps,4393037
,,,,
16497,Presentation,"We are making progress on sale of our land leasing business, despite the impact of COVID on that business. We sold assets totaling over $700,000 during the quarter. This process will continue to the balance of this year and likely in the first half fiscal 2022.",Rob Capps,4393037
,,,,
16498,Presentation,"MIND?s capital structure and liquidity remains solid. At the end of the quarter, we had over $21 million of working capital that included cash and cash equivalents of over $2.6 million. With no funded debt other than two governmental assistance loans, our lean flexible cost structure and the pending sale of our land leasing business, we are well-positioned for the current environment and for an eventual recovery.",Rob Capps,4393037
,,,,
16499,Presentation,,Rob Capps,4393037
,,,,
16500,Presentation,"Despite all the continuing COVID driven volatility in the market, we are still seeing healthy levels of customer interest. There has been an uptick in inquiries with crisper quotes and orders off late. And the most recent example of this will be the recent orders for organic systems and upgrades to be delivered in Q4 and in the first quarter of next year.",Rob Capps,4393037
,,,,
16501,Presentation,"We believe that the increased interest that we have seen for numerous -- from numerous customers and our source control technology is indicative of improving activity within the range of seismic exploration market. Our firm order backlog now stands at $8.2 million at the end of this third quarter, up sequentially from $7.6 million at the end of the second quarter.",Rob Capps,4393037
,,,,
16502,Presentation,"Now although the effects of COVID on market fundamentals can wreak havoc on the timing and pace of our orders, we have nonetheless seen improvement in the global marine markets. As we have emphasized before heightened logistical hurdles and uncertainty around customer spending will continue to be a factor in short-term visibility, but we currently expect fourth quarter results from our Marine Technology Products business to show improvement from third quarter levels and that this trend will continue into fiscal 2022.",Rob Capps,4393037
,,,,
16503,Presentation,"Our more hopeful outlook does not mean that we can now return to our normal operating procedure. We remain guarded and watchful and assisting market conditions and should conditions take a turn for the worst, we stand ready to make further adjustments to our operations and cost structure and our balance sheet affords us a good measure of flexibility towards raising additional capital should that need arise.",Rob Capps,4393037
,,,,
16504,Presentation,"Our focus on operational execution and implementation of our strategic initiatives will remain foremost in our minds. We look to build on our strengths and add innovative new technologies to our portfolio, while also harnessing and adapting proven technologies, and to novel new solutions that can economically address the needs of the global marine marketplace. Adhering to these principles will take us a long way towards completion of our transformation and the ultimate realization of our long-term strategic goals.",Rob Capps,4393037
,,,,
16505,Presentation,"That concludes our former comments, and at this time, we will be happy to open up the lines for your questions. Operator?",Rob Capps,4393037
,,,,
16506,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Tyson Bauer with KC Capital. Please proceed.,Operator,4393037
,,,,
16507,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. Good morning, gentlemen.",Tyson Bauer,4393037
,,,,
16508,Question-and-Answer,"Hey, Tyson.",Rob Capps,4393037
,,,,
16509,Question-and-Answer,"Good morning, Tyson.",Guy Malden,4393037
,,,,
16510,Question-and-Answer,"In the third quarter, the -- you made the comment that that?s somewhat beat your expectations going into the quarter. You knew the source controller was going to hit or you had a thought that was going to happen. What part of the Q3 results were you pleasantly surprised by that you achieved that you do not expect going into the quarter?",Tyson Bauer,4393037
,,,,
16511,Question-and-Answer,"It?s mostly on the exploration market -- the seismic exploration market those since other source controller activity, as well as repair activities spare parts, things like that and just kind of a general uptick in activity we are seeing in that area right now contributed to that.",Rob Capps,4393037
,,,,
16512,Question-and-Answer,Okay. So it has more to do with the outlook and the activity on bidding possible orders in the future. That was the unexpected pleasant surprise for you?,Tyson Bauer,4393037
,,,,
16513,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. That?s right. I mean there was no one single order that contributed that is a number of smaller ones kind of ended up. So, again, just general uptick in activity.",Rob Capps,4393037
,,,,
16514,Question-and-Answer,And the new order that you announced a couple of days ago?,Tyson Bauer,4393037
,,,,
16515,Question-and-Answer,Yeah.,Rob Capps,4393037
,,,,
16516,Question-and-Answer,"? probably in the range of what we have seen in the past between that $1.5 million, $2 million range that would be added into that backlog you had at the end of October?",Tyson Bauer,4393037
,,,,
16517,Question-and-Answer,,Tyson Bauer,4393037
,,,,
16518,Question-and-Answer,Yeah. Those are upgrades. The last few things are upgrade systems. So those can vary but they are typically north of $1 million.,Rob Capps,4393037
,,,,
16519,Question-and-Answer,Okay.,Tyson Bauer,4393037
,,,,
16520,Question-and-Answer,It can be a bit more. It can be a bit less. But that?s just to give you a sense of magnitude.,Rob Capps,4393037
,,,,
16521,Question-and-Answer,R&D was up due to testing. I am guessing that was more so with the military some of those tests you are completing. Should we anticipate staying at that level or higher R&D spend as you try to get that new product launch with your partner in Europe and additional activities with that partnership?,Tyson Bauer,4393037
,,,,
16522,Question-and-Answer,"We have a bit of a spike in the third quarter as we put out this test system for passing array. It was deployed on the East Coast on -- in the ocean. So that contributed to some of that. Like R&D activity in general, it will start to -- it will be the same general level we have seen recently. But there was a bit of a spike I think.",Rob Capps,4393037
,,,,
16523,Question-and-Answer,Okay. So we will return back kind of that $0.75 million range?,Tyson Bauer,4393037
,,,,
16524,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. Roughly, again, any given quarter you could see some activity picked that up, especially for that test systems things like that.",Rob Capps,4393037
,,,,
16525,Question-and-Answer,Okay. And the cash flow statement you have $1.6 million from PPP. So is that then officially been forgiven? You do not have to pay that back. And what additional foreign reimbursement did you get on payroll expenses and other initiatives by those countries?,Tyson Bauer,4393037
,,,,
16526,Question-and-Answer,"Well, the PPP has been officially forgiven. Yeah. We have made application that?s going through the process. We anticipate most if not all to be forgiven. And there?s a few hundred thousand from foreign programs, Singapore, U.K., things of that nature. I don?t have the exact number in front of me. But it?s a few hundred thousand.",Rob Capps,4393037
,,,,
16527,Question-and-Answer,Okay. So if?,Tyson Bauer,4393037
,,,,
16528,Question-and-Answer,Yeah. Not so much in the quarter. That was really earlier in the year.,Rob Capps,4393037
,,,,
16529,Question-and-Answer,"Right. So if I go through those numbers, you had $2.7 million in asset sales, I want to, call it, roughly about $2 million and reimbursements by various government activities, PPP and the other ones you just mentioned, and a $1.3 million inflow from common stock sale. That?s about $6 million bringing in the door to help up the balance sheet. That?s hard to replicate. Well, obviously, you have the asset sales that you still have to complete?",Tyson Bauer,4393037
,,,,
16530,Question-and-Answer,Right.,Rob Capps,4393037
,,,,
16531,Question-and-Answer,? next year.,Tyson Bauer,4393037
,,,,
16532,Question-and-Answer,Right.,Rob Capps,4393037
,,,,
16533,Question-and-Answer,But at some point we are going to have to get the cash flow from operations to get those going. Are we really?,Tyson Bauer,4393037
,,,,
16534,Question-and-Answer,Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.,Rob Capps,4393037
,,,,
16535,Question-and-Answer,Okay. Go ahead.,Tyson Bauer,4393037
,,,,
16536,Question-and-Answer,"Well, so, absolutely. I mean, of course, you look at on the year-to-date numbers, of course, not quarterly numbers, so year-to-date numbers you are looking at.",Rob Capps,4393037
,,,,
16537,Question-and-Answer,Yeah.,Tyson Bauer,4393037
,,,,
16538,Question-and-Answer,"But you are right. COVID is definitely slowed down our timetable to put us where we are comfortably on a cash flow positive quarter-after-quarter. But we see the path there, most clearly. There is some uncertainty given the environment that we definitely see the path to it.",Rob Capps,4393037
,,,,
16539,Question-and-Answer,Okay. And what was related to that common stock proceeds?,Tyson Bauer,4393037
,,,,
16540,Question-and-Answer,"We have an ATM we have put in place. We tested the market a bit to see what the market looked on average and that?s wasn?t much, that?s what it was.",Rob Capps,4393037
,,,,
16541,Question-and-Answer,Okay. And was that done to just institutional or in the general market or was that specific to insiders?,Tyson Bauer,4393037
,,,,
16542,Question-and-Answer,No. It?s in general in the markets.,Rob Capps,4393037
,,,,
16543,Question-and-Answer,Okay. And you talked about asset sales being completed by the first half of next year. Should we see any activity there in this next quarter and the quarter we are currently in that would give you some cushion?,Tyson Bauer,4393037
,,,,
16544,Question-and-Answer,"I think we will definitely some activity this quarter, mostly in fall.",Rob Capps,4393037
,,,,
16545,Question-and-Answer,Okay.,Tyson Bauer,4393037
,,,,
16546,Question-and-Answer,And we?,Rob Capps,4393037
,,,,
16547,Question-and-Answer,"What was the thought -- I get this question a lot by some of your institutional holders and that is, what was the thought process behind putting out such large numbers in that five-year target, given the difficulty the company has been in and achieving those financial results or progress? What was that trigger that tipping point that said, we are now at that point, we are confident, we are comfortable. We can put out a $1.3 billion addressable that we can go after or $140 million in five years 20% margin?",Tyson Bauer,4393037
,,,,
16548,Question-and-Answer,,Tyson Bauer,4393037
,,,,
16549,Question-and-Answer,Right.,Rob Capps,4393037
,,,,
16550,Question-and-Answer,"What occurred or what happened that said, all right now is the time, we can do that. We have got an ace up our sleeve. It?s going to be a stair step. It?s going to be a gradual trajectory. Just give us a little sense on why all of a sudden we have gone to this route?",Tyson Bauer,4393037
,,,,
16551,Question-and-Answer,"Sure. It doesn?t start much as all of a sudden. I mean we have been building towards this, Tyson. We have done -- we did rebranding. We made the decision to exit the land business. And we saw some of the strategic initiatives that the Guy referred to start to develop. And we just felt like the time is right to let?s assess what the market looks like. Let?s share that with our shareholders as to what we think our potential looks like. Yet, we are not there yet. But we see that market there and we see a path to that level.",Rob Capps,4393037
,,,,
16552,Question-and-Answer,"These are big markets we are addressing. They are new markets for us. They are new applications of our existing technology. So we just -- it?s a combination of things. There?s no one thing, that said, ah-ha, it?s there.",Rob Capps,4393037
,,,,
16553,Question-and-Answer,But there are a number of things started to come together again through these strategic initiatives with the partnership in Europe -- with our European partner. That?s one of the things. Not by itself but one of the things.,Rob Capps,4393037
,,,,
16554,Question-and-Answer,"The applications that we see with our streamer technology into passive arrays gave some confidence. The reception we are getting for our MA-X Technology, our gas turbine [ph] technology.",Rob Capps,4393037
,,,,
16555,Question-and-Answer,"And how we think that?s going to enhance the acceptance of our overall side scan sonar products and how we can apply that into unmanned vehicles. So, again, all of these things came together. We just thought it was the right time to share that.",Rob Capps,4393037
,,,,
16556,Question-and-Answer,"And is it more of a stair step effect in, let?s say, year one pending X contract. We could materially improve ourselves and our position and work off that base for a step two or is this more of a hockey stick where in year three or whatever or four, all of a sudden we will see an exponential type growth scenario?",Tyson Bauer,4393037
,,,,
16557,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. I mean that?s tough to predict, Tyson. And I think we see it is building gradually. But given the nature of some of these markets we are pursuing, you continue to get a bit of a stair step from time-to-time. But those are difficult to predict. So we are looking at more of a gradual increase but there certainly is opportunity for the -- for the big step.",Rob Capps,4393037
,,,,
16558,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. Thank you, gentlemen.",Tyson Bauer,4393037
,,,,
16559,Question-and-Answer,Yeah. You bet.,Rob Capps,4393037
,,,,
16560,Question-and-Answer,"Thanks, Tyson.",Guy Malden,4393037
,,,,
16561,Question-and-Answer,Our next question is from Ross Taylor with ARS. Please proceed.,Operator,4393037
,,,,
16562,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. It?s always exhausting following Tyson. Can you give us a little bit more color on where you specifically see your technologies bringing advantages to the market versus current technologies and an example in towed array how old is the current technology and why do you see what you are doing being a significant improvement in that area?,Ross Taylor,4393037
,,,,
16563,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. So, Ross, I think, you have to think about this in context of some of the other developments in the marketplace, specifically the unmanned vehicles. That?s changing that marketplace and changing the applications.",Rob Capps,4393037
,,,,
16564,Question-and-Answer,"So that example, the towed streamer example, we are applying commercially developed technology to our sonar streamer, reconfiguring that to be applied in a maritime security or ASW type applications.",Rob Capps,4393037
,,,,
16565,Question-and-Answer,While we think we bring to the table is a robust economical solution that doesn?t a cost of multi-million dollars and having the production capacity to bring to market very quickly is a big advantage. So it?s a combination of taking what we already have making into new application plus that the changes in the marketplace.,Rob Capps,4393037
,,,,
16566,Question-and-Answer,That can maybe is ?,Guy Malden,4393037
,,,,
16567,Question-and-Answer,Now that we are bringing,Rob Capps,4393037
,,,,
16568,Question-and-Answer,Yeah.,Ross Taylor,4393037
,,,,
16569,Question-and-Answer,"I am sorry, just one?",Guy Malden,4393037
,,,,
16570,Question-and-Answer,,Guy Malden,4393037
,,,,
16571,Question-and-Answer,No. Please go ahead. Yeah.,Ross Taylor,4393037
,,,,
16572,Question-and-Answer,"Ross, the technology that we are bringing from the streamer exploration side, the seismic exploration side is a newer technology than some of the traditional passive array technology that?s out there for a number of years, as Rob said, certainly, more economical and more robust. So there are some differences.",Guy Malden,4393037
,,,,
16573,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. And with the unmanned vehicles, the Air Force is putting a lot of effort into what might be call the loyal wingman problem the idea or a program idea of working with drones, effectively force multiplying, manned aircraft. The Navy is supposedly I have been told doing the same type of thing, looking at the ability to turn submarines into -- manned submarines into effectively almost controllers of armed and capable unmanned vehicles often smaller. Is some of the market you see tied into that type of program where the Navy would be able to? And the Chinese, as you mentioned, Chinese have substantial submarine fleet. The U.S. is actually significantly under submarine and is falling behind even our prior expectations of what we needed it to be until it seemed that there?s going to be a lot of energy and a lot of money put into this idea of underwater loyal wingman and is your technology involved in that?",Ross Taylor,4393037
,,,,
16574,Question-and-Answer,Absolutely. Yes. Yes. That?s exactly the same thing -- sort of thing we are looking at.,Rob Capps,4393037
,,,,
16575,Question-and-Answer,And multiple products both sonar side and then the passive array side.,Guy Malden,4393037
,,,,
16576,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. And with regard to your European partner, what markets outside the U.S. are you guys working on at this point in time or what markets do you see is offering significant opportunities. I know the Australians, for example, have been sinking a lot of money into anti-submarine warfare and submarine capabilities and the like. But where in the world do you see these opportunities coming up?",Ross Taylor,4393037
,,,,
16577,Question-and-Answer,"Well, I think, all over the world other than obvious places such as Korea, China, Iran, look, places like that. But I think there are opportunities in Europe, most definitely. There are other opportunities in the Pacific Rim, without a doubt.",Rob Capps,4393037
,,,,
16578,Question-and-Answer,Correct.,Guy Malden,4393037
,,,,
16579,Question-and-Answer,So it?s wide ranging.,Rob Capps,4393037
,,,,
16580,Question-and-Answer,Okay.,Ross Taylor,4393037
,,,,
16581,Question-and-Answer,And we don?t preclude the U.S. Navy as well.,Guy Malden,4393037
,,,,
16582,Question-and-Answer,Oh! Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.,Rob Capps,4393037
,,,,
16583,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. I wasn?t precluding it, I was just looking at -- it seems that there are a lot of opportunities elsewhere. So basically this is you could fall under U.S. technology. So therefore do you need U.S. approval to sell your technology?",Ross Taylor,4393037
,,,,
16584,Question-and-Answer,"Well, it is subject to certain export controls as our stuff is today. That?s definitely new for us. And which export controls?",Rob Capps,4393037
,,,,
16585,Question-and-Answer,Right.,Ross Taylor,4393037
,,,,
16586,Question-and-Answer,"? it kind of depends on the product and what?s included in it. So, I mean, the answer is -- short answer is, yes, but that?s nothing new to us.",Rob Capps,4393037
,,,,
16587,Question-and-Answer,"Right. Okay. Well, this is very exciting. It looks like we have the waiting for Gudope [ph] for some time. We might finally be getting off the beach. That?s pretty exciting. Thanks.",Ross Taylor,4393037
,,,,
16588,Question-and-Answer,We are working hard.,Rob Capps,4393037
,,,,
16589,Question-and-Answer,I appreciate it. Thanks guys.,Ross Taylor,4393037
,,,,
16590,Question-and-Answer,You bet.,Rob Capps,4393037
,,,,
16591,Question-and-Answer,"Thanks, Ross.",Guy Malden,4393037
,,,,
16592,Question-and-Answer,This does conclude the question-and-answer portion of the call. I would now like to turn the call back over to management for final comments.,Operator,4393037
,,,,
16593,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. Thank you, Operator. Thank you for joining us today. Taking your time to talk to us and we look forward to talking to you again at the end of our fourth quarter. Thanks very much.",Rob Capps,4393037
,,,,
16594,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. This does conclude today?s program. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.,Operator,4393037
,,,,
16595,Presentation,"Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Zumiez Inc. third quarter fiscal 2020 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference.",Operator,4392970
,,,,
16596,Presentation,"Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone of the company's Safe Harbor language. Today's conference call includes comments concerning Zumiez Inc. business outlook and contains forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements and all other statements that may be made on this call that are not based on historical facts are subject to risks and uncertainties.

Additional information concerning a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the information that will be discussed is available in Zumiez filings with the SEC.",Operator,4392970
,,,,
16597,Presentation,"At this time, I will turn the call over to Rick Brooks, Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.",Operator,4392970
,,,,
16598,Presentation,"Hello and thank you everyone for joining us on the call. With me today is Chris Work, our Chief Financial Officer. I will begin today's call with a few remarks about the third quarter. Then I will share some thoughts on sales for the fourth quarter-to-date before handing the call over to Chris who will take you through the numbers. After that, we will open up the call to your questions.",Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16599,Presentation,"Our teams continue to do an incredible job navigating volatile market conditions. After successfully executing the reopening of the vast majority of our stores during the second quarter, we faced the back-to-school season that was very different from prior years. As many states and districts around the country delayed the start of the new school year or decided to begin with virtual instructions due to the pandemic, we did not see the sustained lift in demand we typically do starting in late July and running through early September.",Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16600,Presentation,"As we saw, the second most important selling period of the year got off to a very challenging start as sales were down in the last week of July and every week in August. Though negative, the trends improved week-over-week throughout August turning positive in the first week of September and remained very strong through the end of the quarter. This supported our hypothesis that we would have a prolonged back-to-school season with some demand shifting out to later in the third quarter. These trends exceeded our expectations and were able to show sales growth during the quarter. Our ability to capture as much late season demand as we did and more than makeup for the lost volumes during the historical peak weeks in August underscores the strength of our brand and culture and speaks to the ability of our business model to adapt to change.",Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16601,Presentation,"For the third quarter, revenue increased 2.6% despite the slow start, a difficult selling environment, reduced hours and stores being open roughly 5% fewer days than a year ago. Strong digital activity and robust full price selling across all geographies highlighted our topline performance as we continued to experience solid demand for our distinct and differentiated merchandise assortments.",Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16602,Presentation,"Our total comparable open store sales increased 8.1%, led by 39.6% growth in web sales and 2.2% comparable sales growth in our stores. Our teams were relentless in their commitment to serving our customers, which contributed to stronger results than we anticipated and positive comparable sales across all geographies. Our performance was once again highlighted by strong product margin gains fueled by full price selling. At the same time, we experienced meaningful leverage as a result of the efforts we made to refine our model over the last few years as well as the reductions we made to our expense structure in response to the pandemic.",Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16603,Presentation,,Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16604,Presentation,"Looking beyond the pandemic, we expect many of these costs will come back into the income statement along with lost revenue as we return to a more normal operating environment likely sometime next year. The combination of all these factors contributed to earnings per share increasing 54% in the third quarter to $1.16 and favorable cash generation. With well over $300 million in cash on our balance sheet and no debt, we are well-positioned to navigate what is likely to be a volatile operating environment over the next few quarters, while investing strategically in the business.",Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16605,Presentation,"Our recent performance has been years in the making. We have spoken before about the significance of our culture and brand and how they serve as critical competitive advantages that helped us win throughout our 40-plus year history. This has never been more true than in 2020 and it starts with our people. The investments we made in our people coming into this year and through the pandemic have allowed us to maintain a high level of service and timely fulfillment despite the disruptions to our operations caused by the virus. As it has in the past, I am confident that our unwavering commitment to our people will continue to further set Zumiez apart from the competition and meaningfully benefit our long term performance.",Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16606,Presentation,"Looking ahead, while there has been positive news recently about the effectiveness of certain vaccines, there is still a great deal of uncertainty about the state of retail and the global economy due to the impact from COVID-19. We are currently expecting that given the demographics of our customers and employee base, generally speaking, they are most likely to be at the latter end of the vaccination process. We are currently experiencing the effects of the health crisis, that the health crisis is having on our holiday season around the world as many local, state and federal governments have forced nonessential stores to either re-close or operate under other restrictions.",Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16607,Presentation,"In our European market quarter-to-date through Tuesday, we have had roughly 17% fewer open store days than one year ago. Stores operating have reduced hours during the holiday season, government is encouraging the current customers to stay home and a slow to important winter sports season. Meanwhile, quarter-to-date through Tuesday in North America, we had roughly 2% fewer open store days than last year, reduced operating hours during the important peak Black Friday weekend and significant metering of traffic tied to both government orders as well as potential safety concerns.",Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16608,Presentation,"We expect that the store closures and various other operating instructions will fluctuate as we move through the quarter. Through the store shutdowns and industry headwinds, fourth quarter-to-date sales through Tuesday, December 1 decreased roughly 3.9% from the comparable period in the prior year. North America sales were strong through the first three weeks of November. The Black Friday weekend was significantly impacted by traffic declines, closures and traffic metering across a meaningful number of our locations. Much the same as the back-to-school season, we are seeing better performance versus last year in the off-peak weeks and more challenged results during the times that are additionally relied more on heavy store traffic. Internationally, Europe has experienced meaningful sales declines in the fourth quarter-to-date, as previously mentioned, while Australia sales growth has been the strongest in the company.",Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16609,Presentation,"It is unclear at this point how the remainder of the year will play out. Regardless of what unfolds, Zumiez, as it has been, is well-positioned to pivot to the needs of our customers wherever, whenever and however they want to engage with us. Thanks to our dynamic teams, our one channel mentality and advance fulfillment capabilities including Zumiez Delivery, which we expanded in the fourth quarter take our best-in-class sales team directly to our customer's door in select markets around the United States.",Rick Brooks,4392970

16611,Presentation,"Periods of significant change create opportunities. Companies that that have the right people, strategies and resources in place can take advantage of times like this to advance their brand and business. While Zumiez isn't immune to the disruption created by the pandemic, we do believe the current environment will accelerate further consolidation globally and that our focus on our customer will lead to further wallet and mindshare gains as we emerge from the crisis.",Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16612,Presentation,"We must be smart in how we navigate the business challenges, while also looking for long term strategic investments that will set us up for the future. These include great real estate opportunities, new tools within our one channel strategy and other strategic investments to support the next era of intimacy and now with our customers. The strength in our financial position can be a significant advantage in these times.",Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16613,Presentation,I have great confidence in our teams and their proven ability to navigate through unforeseen challenges. Our response to the pandemic has highlighted the strength of our culture and brand and bolstered my optimism about future for Zumiez.,Rick Brooks,4392970

16614,Presentation,"With that, I will turn the call to Chris to discuss the financials. Chris?",Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16615,Presentation,"Thanks Rick and good afternoon everyone. I am going to start with a few high level comments on the financial strength of the business, review our third quarter and then provide an update on our quarter-to-date sales through the past Tuesday before discussing a few updates on the full year.",Chris Work,4392970
,,,,
16616,Presentation,"We entered fiscal 2020 in a strong financial position with cash over $250 million and coming off the highest earnings per share in the history of our company. This resulted from years of commitment and hard work by our teams, coupled with strong financial planning. Now, through the initial store closures in March and continued challenges to-date, we have seen the strength of our one channel model with our teams working diligently to serve the customer.",Chris Work,4392970
,,,,
16617,Presentation,"The business ended the third quarter in a strong financial position. Cash and current marketable securities increased 77% to $316.12 million as of October 31, 2020, compared to $178.6 million as of November 2, 2019. The increase in cash and current marketable securities was driven by cash generated through operations, including deferment of $53 million in payment composed of lower inventory levels, landlord obligations, extended vendor terms and deferred payroll tax payments as well as net income improvements related to abatements, credits and expense reductions. This increase was partially offset by $13.4 million of share repurchases through the company's stock buyback program prior to our stores closing in March due to COVID-19 and other planned capital expenditures.",Chris Work,4392970
,,,,
16618,Presentation,"As of October 31, 2020, we have no debt on the balance sheet and continue to maintain our full unused credit line of $35 million. We ended third quarter of 2020 with $161 million in inventory, compared with $183.4 million last year, a decrease of $22.4 million or 12.2%. After delaying or canceling orders during the first quarter, we have continued to work with our brand partners as demand has exceeded our expectations in the second and third quarter. Overall, the inventory on hand is healthy and selling at a favorable margin entering the fourth quarter and we continue to increase our levels in key categories.",Chris Work,4392970
,,,,
16619,Presentation,"Turning to the income statement. Third quarter net sales increased 2.6% to $271 million, compared to $264 million for the third quarter of 2019. The increase in sales was driven by an 8.1% increase in comparable sales, which includes reopened stores and our digital activities, partially offset by store closures during the period. Breaking down the comparable sales further, we saw meaningful digital strength with comparable web sales growing 39.6% for the quarter while comparable sales for physical stores grew 2.2% year-over-year. Our stores were open for roughly 95% of the potential operating days during the third quarter of 2020.",Chris Work,4392970

Other international net sales, which consists of Europe and Australia, increased $5.1 million or 19.8% to $30.6 million. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, North America net sales increased 0.8% and other international net sales increased 12.5% for the quarter. During the quarter, the hard goods category was our largest positive comping category followed by men's, accessories and women's. Footwear was our only negative comping category.",Chris Work,4392970
,,,,
16622,Presentation,"Third quarter gross profit was %105.8 million compared to $94.6 million in the third quarter of last year. And gross margin was 39% compared to 35.8% a year ago. The 320 basis point increase in gross margin was primarily driven by 170 basis point increase in product margin, 150 basis point improvement in inventory shrinkage and a 30 basis point decrease in store occupancy cost. This was partially offset by 40 basis point increase in web shipping costs due to higher web penetration. However, shipping costs leveraged the prior year were compared to total shipped sales.",Chris Work,4392970
,,,,
16623,Presentation,"SG&A expense was $67.9 million or 25% of net sales in the third quarter compared to $70.3 million or 26% of net sales a year ago. The 160 basis point decrease in SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales was primarily driven by 90 basis point decrease in our store wages, a 40 basis points of leverage in other store costs, 40 this point decrease in corporate costs, 30 basis point decrease due to governmental payroll credits and 30 basis point decrease in national training and recognition event costs. These improvements were partially that by a 40 basis point increase in annual discretionary incentive compensation and a 30 basis point increase in impairments on fixed assets.",Chris Work,4392970
,,,,
16624,Presentation,"Operating income in the third quarter of 2020 was $37.9 million or 14% of net sales compared with operating income in the prior year of $24.3 million or 9.2% of net sales. During the quarter, we recognized flow through on incremental sales of almost 200% based on the factors outlined above and our ability to adjust quickly in this challenging time.",Chris Work,4392970
,,,,
16625,Presentation,"Net income for the third quarter was $29.1 million or $1.16 per share compared to net income of $19.2 million or $0.75 per share for the third quarter of 2019. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2020 was 24.7% compared to 25% in the year ago period. Looking at year-to-date results, from a sales and earnings perspective, this year has incredibly volatile quarter-to-quarter. Year-to-date sales through the third quarter are currently down 6.6% or just over $46 million, while earnings per share have grown 15.8% to $1.32.",Chris Work,4392970
,,,,
16626,Presentation,"We continue to benefit from both our optimization efforts within the model as well as from one-time adjustments we have made in response to the pandemic around managing our payroll cost, reducing events, travel and training, managing marketing efforts, working with our landlords and receiving governmental subsidies tied to continue to pay our people. As we move into 2021, we expect quarter-to-quarter volatility to continue as we transition back to a normalized sales and expense environment.",Chris Work,4392970
,,,,
16627,Presentation,"Now to our fiscal fourth quarter to-date sales results. Total fourth quarter to-date sales through December 1 were down roughly 3.9% compared with the same time period in the prior year ended December 3, 2019. Our stores were closed for roughly 3% of the potential operating days during this timeframe due to the ongoing mandated store closures, both domestically and internationally. We also experienced significant metering and reduced operating hours.",Chris Work,4392970
,,,,
16628,Presentation,"Total comparable sales for the quarter-to-date period ending December 1 were down roughly 1.7%. By channel, our quarter-to-date comparable store sales decreased 7.8% and our e-commerce sales increased 16.7%. Our sales were stronger in the first few weeks of the fourth quarter as we saw customers look to purchase when store traffic was lighter. Sales were challenging during the imported Black Friday weekend as noted Rick earlier.",Chris Work,4392970
,,,,
16629,Presentation,,Chris Work,4392970
,,,,
16630,Presentation,"For a regional perspective, our North America business has experienced a 0.6% increase in the fourth quarter through Tuesday while our European business has seen an over 30% decline with store closures and reduced across the business as well as a slow start to important snow season. The quarter-to-date comparable sales decrease discussed above was driven by a decrease in transaction, partially offset by an increase in dollars per transaction. Dollars per transaction increased due to an increase in units per transaction, partially offset by a decline in average unit retail. Quarter-to-date, footwear was our largest negative comping category followed by men's and women's. The hard good category was our largest positive comping category followed by accessories.",Chris Work,4392970
,,,,
16631,Presentation,"Due to limited visibility in the business, we will not be providing guidance for the fourth quarter of 2020 or the fiscal year. That said, we do want to give a few thoughts on how we are looking at 2020 wrapping up. We believe sales during the fourth quarter will continue to be impacted by closures, traffic metering and sales trends that are hard to predict. To prepare for this, our teams have built multiple scenarios to navigate the range of possibilities and we are continuing to monitor our results against those scenarios.",Chris Work,4392970
,,,,
16632,Presentation,We are expecting that our total sales for the full quarter will be better than our quarter-to-date result of down roughly 3.9%. This includes our North America sales trending flat to up low single digits for the quarter and our European business being significantly impacted by store closures as well as reduced winter sports activities. We drove a product margin increase of 170 basis points in the third quarter and have had a positive start to the fourth quarter.,Chris Work,4392970
,,,,
16633,Presentation,"We are managing inventory tightly and working with our brand partners to navigate this environment. In the fourth quarter, we expect to see a benefit in product margin to the prior year but do not anticipate that it will be as significant as the year-over-year growth experienced in our third quarter. We continue to manage cost across the business, understanding this challenging environment and limited visibility. Through the first nine months, we have seen significant reductions in certain expenses as we work to align the cost structure to the sales loss during our closures.",Chris Work,4392970
,,,,
16634,Presentation,"We are currently planning SG&A expenses across the business to be down approximately 9% compared with 2019 associated with reduced hours in stores, the reduction in travel and training, reductions in planned capital spending, reductions of incentive and many other benefits. With the potential variability in performance over the important holiday quarter, this estimate could increase or decrease as we gain more visibility to the sales trends, our ability to further adjust expenses and the potential for non-cash impairments.",Chris Work,4392970
,,,,
16635,Presentation,"We now expect to open approximately new 12 stores in 2020, including three stores in North America, seven stores in Europe and two stores in Australia. This is down from our plan coming into the year of 20 new stores. We expect capital expenditures for the full 2020 fiscal year to be approximately $11 million compared to $19 million in 2019 and our original plan for 2020 of between $18 million and $20 million. The majority of our capital spend will be dedicated to new store openings and planned remodels. We expect that depreciation and amortization, excluding non-cash lease expense, will be probably $24 million, down from $25.1 million in the prior year.",Chris Work,4392970
,,,,
16636,Presentation,"Yesterday, our Board of Directors approved the repurchase of up to $100 million of our common stock. This repurchase authorization replaces the previously approved $100 million repurchase program and is expected to continue through January 29, 2022, unless the time period is extended or shortened by the Board of Directors.

,,,,
16638,Presentation,"With that, operator, we would like to open the call for questions.",Chris Work,4392970
,,,,
16639,Question-and-Answer,[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Janine Stichter with Jefferies. Your line is now open.,Operator,4392970
,,,,
16640,Question-and-Answer,"Hi. Thanks for all the color on the gross margin. Two more questions about the driver there. I think first you called out some pretty nice shipping leverage in the third quarter. I was wondering if that's something you can continue into the fourth quarter? And may be talk a little bit more about what's driving that? And then the shrink, the benefit you saw in the third quarter, is there opportunity in the fourth quarter as well? And may be help us compare the magnitude? Thank you.",Janine Stichter,4392970
,,,,
16641,Question-and-Answer,"Sure. Let me tackle each one of those in order here. So from a shipping perspective and leverage, this is something we have worked on for a long time in how we manage our shipping profile. As you know, we are one of the few retailers that's exclusively shipping 100% of our digital orders from stores. And this is part of our model. And we think it's a really competitive part of our model from a standpoint of thinking about one channel cost structure to serve the customer. And as we have continued to refine that really over the last five years we have been operating like this, we have continued to get better at what we are doing from a shipping perspective.",Chris Work,4392970
,,,,
16642,Question-and-Answer,"And obviously with increased demand here during the COVID time period, we have been able to continue to make strides in what we are doing here from getting inventory in the right place to begin with and minimizing splits to seeing higher DPTs in the cart that's driving a better shipping volume, to continue to work with our carriers and how we are managing costs. So all of these things really play into the model in how are trying to push it going forward. We want to fast to our customers. We want to get them what they want. And we want to try to optimize on the backend.",Chris Work,4392970
,,,,
16643,Question-and-Answer,"From a shrink perspective, shrink has been a pretty significant benefit to us as we move through the year, as we laid out in our prepared remarks. Clearly, the store closures period, coupled with reduced traffic and metering has been benefit to this but we have also been working behind the scenes for the last couple of years. As you may recall, a couple years ago we were talking about this trend going the other way. But our store team has done a really phenomenal job of putting practices and procedures in place, working as a team to bring this line item down. So I think you kind of those efforts that we had throughout 2019 and coming into 2020, coupled with the operating environment we have had here in the first nine months of the year and how we would see it playing out into the fourth quarter, we would expect to see some benefit in shrink just based on how store volumes are being measured.",Chris Work,4392970
,,,,
16644,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. And then just one more on the delivery. I think you mentioned Zumiez Delivery, the sales team going directly to the customer's door. Can you elaborate a little bit more about what that is, how big it is and maybe what the potential is there?",Janine Stichter,4392970
,,,,
16645,Question-and-Answer,"Sure. Janine, I will start and I will have Chris follow-up with some comments too. So I mean it's something we are really exited about that we are able to rollout our Zumiez Delivery effort for this fourth quarter. And we are really excited because it could give us an advantage this year, particularly when shipping companies are restricting shipment due to capacity constraints in the system, because there's so much digital shipping demand.",Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16646,Question-and-Answer,"That said, we are really prepared for this opportunity in Q4, because we have been working on our ability to do delivery for the last two years. And I would like, I guess, everyone to think about this on our kind of innovation spectrum for us or an innovation roadmap. And we have been on this march for many years to how we think about evolving our touch points for every consumer need at every consumer touch points. Our teams did a really great job rolling out the program quickly with great training materials based on our learning we had through all the test phase over the last couple of years. And I can tell you that the rollout has gone really well.",Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16647,Question-and-Answer,,Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16648,Question-and-Answer,"And for me, more broadly, I like to think this is again another example of Zumiez as a leading innovator in specialty retail. It's how we evolved to meet the needs of this really modern empowered consumer. Our goal is to really, again as I said, evaluate every customer touch point and challenge ourselves to how we can improve the experience for our customers. So I guess I would ask you of all the things about putting Zumiez Delivery in the context of the other programs we have discussed including fully localized fulfillment that Chris just mentioned, which we have been doing for about five years now and it has clearly proven to be a winning strategy.",Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16649,Question-and-Answer,"To put Zumiez Delivery in context of the trade area assortment planning initiatives you have heard us talking about where we strive to meet total customer demand, both physical and digital, always transparently available in each trade area we do business. To put Zumiez Delivery effort in context of the broader idea of trade area profitability which you have heard us talk a lot about and now we are striving to optimize the experience, again as you just heard Chris mention, for our customer and our business. And put all these efforts in the context of meeting customer's expectations in any way they want to get their product as we strive for next day or same day capabilities over the long term.",Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16650,Question-and-Answer,"So I guess from me, Janine, due to the sum of the ideas that hopefully, our analyst and investors to see us execute that, we believe, are driving our results, including new ways to bring our brand experience right to our customer's door. And we have a lot more ideas about how we can innovate and how we can be able to continue our lead in innovating, especially at retail. And we are focused on meeting what we think are really rapidly evolving consumer needs.",Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16651,Question-and-Answer,"So to wrap my part of this up, I just want you to know, we have a really clear vision of where we are going and what we need to do and how we need to innovate for this consumer over the next few years. We have really clear roadmaps and a lot of initiatives in front of us, a lot more interesting things besides the Zumiez Delivery to rollout and a clear vision to go achieve these objectives. So again, I hope everyone can think of what we announced in our Zumiez Delivery capabilities in the context of being innovative in how we take steps to serve our customers and then connect our customers is really what the strength of our business are amazing salespeople.",Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16652,Question-and-Answer,So now I will let Chris talk a little bit more about the delivery process. Chris?,Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16653,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. Thanks Rick. And let me just echo my excitement for the program too. This is really cool that our teams are even in spot to be able to execute on this. Obviously, as we started to open stores and starting to operate at full capacity here in the second quarter, we very quickly realized that we could have carrier constraints as we moved into the important holiday peak. And we started brainstorming around those challenges. So as we went to, while we currently do not have full clarity on what's going to happen over the next month, we believe we built a model that we can continue to prioritize our customers.",Chris Work,4392970
,,,,
16654,Question-and-Answer,"This includes really working with our incumbent carrier to prepare for the increased load and web penetration, discussing modeling and potential capacity limits that we have really been working with them on a daily basis for now months. We have brought on additional carriers to diversify and help with some of the constraints that are out there and the potential risk that we saw around holiday.",Chris Work,4392970
,,,,
16655,Question-and-Answer,"And we have launched Zumiez Delivery that we are talking about right now in 24 trade areas. This accounts to as much as 5% to 10% of our daily deliveries right now. This accounts for roughly 150 of our stores. And it's a program, as Rick mentioned, we piloted now for over a year. The concept is pretty simple. We hire our employees and we bring that great employee experience right to our customer's door. And we are really excited about what this opportunity is.",Chris Work,4392970
,,,,
16656,Question-and-Answer,,Chris Work,4392970
,,,,
16657,Question-and-Answer,"We are in the early stages of this large rollout. We actually launched the 23 markets beyond our initial test market in late October. So we have a lot to learn here but we have proven through out testing that we think we can be efficient in this type of environment. And we have really proven in our testing that we can exceed the customer's expectation with speed. And similar to our fulfillment five years, our in-store element five years ago we had concerns back then about some of the financial implications of fulfilling from stores.",Chris Work,4392970
,,,,
16658,Question-and-Answer,"But we knew we had great teams and we knew we had smart people. And if we put effort to it, it was the best thing for the customer. And I think over the last five years, you have seen us really refine our model and that's become accretive service that we have been able to do and we feel comfortable with where we are here on the delivery side too that we can continue to do that as well. So more to come on where this goes for us. But this is a great new capability to add to our suite of capabilities that Rick touched on earlier.",Chris Work,4392970
,,,,
16659,Question-and-Answer,Great. Thanks for the color and best of luck for holiday.,Janine Stichter,4392970
,,,,
16660,Question-and-Answer,Thank you.,Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16661,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. Our next question comes from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Your line is now open.,Operator,4392970
,,,,
16662,Question-and-Answer,"Hi. Good afternoon. I actually find that I have a lot of questions. So I will try to narrow it down. I guess, Rick, you talked about strategic opportunities and I know you talked about real estate within that. So I guess a question there, if you are prepared or willing to take advantage of a more favorable real estate market currently? I know as some of the companies I follow in other sectors are doing so. But I haven't seen anybody yet do that in your neck of the woods. So just curious on your thoughts there. And then on the one channel dynamic, are there any M&A opportunities there that would help you accelerate some of what you are doing? I mean, it's tremendous what you are doing. But obviously, developing your own capabilities could take longer than buying them. So just curious about that. And then lastly on the delivery, is that actually cost-effective relative to traditional, like using UPS or what have you? Or is it more because we are in this high-volume season and it's important to have that optionality for the consumer in what's a really constrained channel right now.",Sharon Zackfia,4392970
,,,,
16663,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. Those are all really great questions, Sharon. So let me start on the first couple and I will let Chris take on Zumiez Delivery the cost structure as we are thinking about it. So yes, we are willing to take advantage on real estate. And obviously, we have the capital to do so. So Sharon, I would tell you that we are already doing so in our international markets, where I think the opportunities are really great. So we are already leaning in, in those markets to where we are really seeing significant drops in rent.",Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16664,Question-and-Answer,"Here in North America, where our business is a more mature business, but still has room for growth, we do have a list of targets of centers that we would like to be in. And we are always engaging with our landlords on those targets and these typically are higher-end centers where either we have not been able to negotiate the right rent structure economically to match what we believe are our business, our sales forecast for those markets or we haven't found the right locations in these centers where we feel strongly about our willingness to take a location in the center.",Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16665,Question-and-Answer,"So we are clearly, here in the U.S. and North American market, still looking at opportunities there, too. And in some cases, it might be a relocation or a repositioning of an existing location, there may be some of that in there, but we would be moving into higher volumes centers in doing that. It would still be a net plus to the business from a revenue point of view. So we are still looking at those, Sharon. And again, then I would step back and put the concept of what we are doing, particularly here in North America. I put the real estate concepts back.",Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16666,Question-and-Answer,,Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16667,Question-and-Answer,"The real estate potential for opportunities back in the context of the concept of trade area and thinking about how do we optimize to serve customers in these trade areas. And we define a trade area as a group of stores that work together in a geographic region to meet all the needs of the customers in that region. And so these are definitely factors that come into our thinking about the evolution of our store portfolio over a period of time. So we can find those opportunities which now our real estate team is always working on here, we will take those advantage here in North America as well. But I would tell you right now, I think the big opportunity is where we still have a ton of growth in front of us, are looking at our international markets, particularly Europe and Australia.",Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16668,Question-and-Answer,"On your second question, again, which is an excellent question about our one channel approach and both the one channel mentality as it relates to serving customers, but the one cost structure that then underlies that which, as Chris mentioned, we are working hard to optimize the experience. And I think these two things go hand-in-hand when we can be fast and responsive, always have whatever the customer wants, completely transparent in those trade areas available anytime they want it. That really gives us the option then, it gives us the ability to really optimize the business and the one cost structure mentality. So it's not just, I think the one channel mentality is meaning that our customer focus that we are going to empower the customers to choose and then the cost structure is about optimizing around that customer experience.",Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16669,Question-and-Answer,"So it's a really great question you are asking about the buy versus build around capabilities. And as I said in the comments regarding Zumiez Delivery, we have a long list of initiatives here of how we think we can innovate around this consumer experience. And we do, in some cases, Sharon, where we don't have the internal capabilities on some of these initiatives, we go outside the business, whether it's development partners, we have really special expertise in a particular area. And we have looked at other parts of our business where we think we could potentially add strength and capabilities and talent by hiring the skill sets we need to do it.",Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16670,Question-and-Answer,"To a great extent, though, so we are not opposed, is the headline, Sharon, looking outside to acquire the skill sets we need. But I would tell you that most cases, it's not so much M&A in terms of business, it's really about talent that we need to acquire the skill sets in most cases where we need to supplement our own Zumiez talent pool to achieve some of the plans we have in place. And we have been doing that around some of these initiatives where we are outside the company, locating what we think is really outstanding talent to help us drive out some of these new goals and ideas we have that we are working on.",Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16671,Question-and-Answer,"So we are not at all opposed to it, though, again, whether it's through consultants and developers or talent acquisition, we are doing those things. And if we found something big enough, Sharon, where we thought it would add, we would definitely take a look at it. There's no doubt about that. And again, we have the capital resources and I think the skill sets and the dominance in our market to be able to lever those opportunities.",Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16672,Question-and-Answer,"So if they come up, we are certainly taking a look at them. If we identify them as something we need, it is certainly something we will consider. But we are constantly looking to add more capabilities. And I just won't leave it to M&A, I think, again, it's about talent acquisition or the use of outside experts in certain areas where we may not have the expertise internally.",Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16673,Question-and-Answer,"And the last thing I guess I would say about that is, one thing that is a challenge for us, Sharon, on these topics is finding cultural alignment. Believe it or not, we just can't hire any outside consultant or developer to help us. They actually have to be willing to think creatively and culturally the way we do. And so we have to find those culturally aligned partners from a values perspective really to get the buy-in to what we are trying to do. So that's not a restricting factor. Those matches are out there for us. We just, in some cases, have to look a little harder to find them.",Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16674,Question-and-Answer,,Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16675,Question-and-Answer,"So to finalize that thought, Sharon, we are open to all sorts of angles, not just in potential look at the M&A activity, but also at talent and looking and broadening our talent acquisition where we need to outside of our historic strengths internally and then looking for outside consultants and experts who can help us in specialized areas.",Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16676,Question-and-Answer,And I will let Chris talk about the Zumiez Delivery cost structures.,Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16677,Question-and-Answer,Yes. Absolutely. And I think it's important to note as we delve deeper into this. This is not a one store to one customer relationship. This does tie directly into what Rick talked about from a trade area perspective. This is a group of stores serving the customers in that market which allows you to increase the inventory base and manage volumes.,Chris Work,4392970
,,,,
16678,Question-and-Answer,"Now, Sharon, you have followed us for a long time, so you know that we are always mindful of costs as we navigate through things. But we are also mindful of what's right for the customer. And I think one of the beauties of being able to test this program now for over a year is we have been able to see how the volumes react in trade area as we seasonally move through the year, we have been able to see the peaks and see the values and being able to adjust and tweak the program to try to drive effectiveness as you do mass rollout.",Chris Work,4392970
,,,,
16679,Question-and-Answer,"So at this point in time, we have certainly seen that we can do this for sustained periods at or near what the cost of the carriers are. Obviously, we have had time periods where we have been above and time periods where we have been at. And I think the best part about it is, again, ties back to what I have mentioned earlier is, the experience that the customers had. So we feel pretty confident in moving out into the test group that our teams will be able to manage this. And over time, we will be able to optimize it.",Chris Work,4392970
,,,,
16680,Question-and-Answer,"We still have a lot to do. We obviously accelerated this rollout based on the current environment we are in. So we have more technology, more process improvement and things we will put in place. But in rolling it out, it was a pretty calculated effort on where we thought costs would go. And obviously, as we move through the fourth quarter months here, we will get a much better read on it.",Chris Work,4392970
,,,,
16681,Question-and-Answer,"Maybe, Chris, you could give a little bit color on how much delivery we are doing ourselves within the trade areas we are using the program.",Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16682,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. At this point in time, as I mentioned, from a total company, we are at that 5% to 10%. And within an individual trade area, we have gone to 25% to 30%. So we are able to get more capacity and I think that's a number that we can also see increase, as we continue to move along. And as we are able to increase that overall capacity, obviously, the economics of the program become better. And this is where it actually all feeds itself. And you know we have worked on this for a while as we have localized fulfillment of getting the right products in the right trade areas. And it's a total company effort because it starts with our buyers, really thinking about the product they are going to buy upfront and then the allocation process. And obviously, this delivery drives through to those initiatives to make sure we have the right product in the right places.",Chris Work,4392970
,,,,
16683,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. It's a classic old retail maximum, right product, right place, right time. We are just taking it to all new level, I guess, Sharon, in terms of what that means from the concept of trade area and total demand within the trade area. So when we talk about demand and trade, we mean both physical and digital demand and then how we serve customers and plan products for that. And again, remember, what we are looking to do is we are really looking to create amazing brand experiences at every touch point.",Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16684,Question-and-Answer,,Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16685,Question-and-Answer,"And so while we don't always share what our roadmaps are, if you just take that idea alone and think about what it means in this empowered consumer world and then we are thinking about how we can do that and make it as human-to-human connections as possible across this. And then we have evolution plan. So while we are in the process now of just making sure that it was going to be a very constrained delivery time period, a holiday and maybe we are going to be able to deliver product closer to the holiday season we have ever been able to deliver it, up in those final days.",Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16686,Question-and-Answer,We have some more work to do to make that transparency available for customers to do and I hope we are going to get there. But it could give us a tremendous leg up in the days in advance of Christmas. But we have more work to do to get there to be clear in this process.,Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16687,Question-and-Answer,"But I mean, these are one of the cool things, I think, Sharon, that again I am just so proud of all of our teams to be able to execute. We are able to pull a lever that no one else really can pull. And I think eventually we are going to find our teams can really tune this, we are going to know what's a profitable order for us to deliver and what's not. And our algorithms will take care of funneling those orders if it's right into our own delivery capabilities, into our own system for delivery capabilities.",Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16688,Question-and-Answer,"And then as we think about the evolution of this, think about the point in time then when we are going to get to the customer's door and we are going to add on to the sale. And this gets back to our way of thinking about our point of sales and how we connect digitally into the customer experience.",Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16689,Question-and-Answer,What happens if we can add 1% or 2% more to sales across the delivery process? What happens if we can correct sizing and we are out there able to deliver the customers in all-new ways? What happens if we are out there with the customer's first skateboard showing that young girl how to do her first kickflip in the driveway?,Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16690,Question-and-Answer,"This is what we talked about on the power of the Zumiez brand experience, the power of our amazing people. We are bringing it all together and then optimize the experience around the customer. And I think that's just going to be, again, all these ideas have multiple, multiple levels to what we are trying to do. So it's rally, I think there's going to be one of the fun parts about how we think about our future and where we are going to go.",Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16691,Question-and-Answer,Thank you.,Sharon Zackfia,4392970
,,,,
16692,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Van Sinderen with B. Riley. Your line is open.,Operator,4392970
,,,,
16693,Question-and-Answer,Yes. Hi everyone. Just a follow-up on the delivery. Did you say if the plan is to have Zumiez Delivery to all trade areas or all stores? And also will that run all year? Or is that just during peak periods? And I guess how much of your e-com delivery do you expect to be Zumiez Delivery?,Jeff Van Sinderen,4392970
,,,,
16694,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. Jeff, thanks. Obviously, as I mentioned, this is very early on. And right now, we are in 24 trade areas. We definitely think there is the potential to expand from 24 trade areas. As you could imagine, there are certain stores that represent their own trade area because of their remoteness in connection to other stores. So we haven't really gone down the path of what it might look like in those types of stores. So this isn't something that we are thinking would be rolled out to all of our stores across the country. But certainly, all of our stores in metropolitan areas that work with each other to serve the customer, we think we can operate in all trade areas like that.",Chris Work,4392970
,,,,
16695,Question-and-Answer,"And I think, as Rick talked about this kind of innovation lab of the different ways to serve the customer, this is a key part of our strategy, to innovate and export. And we have done it with Europe and Australia already in many different examples and Canada as well. Everyone's at different path points on the path here. Obviously, in many of the markets we are operating internationally, we just need to get to scale of stores and digital to serve the customer. But as we continue to push, we are already seeing that today, including being able to fulfill from store in Europe, which is obviously a challenged market with some of our stores closed there.",Chris Work,4392970
,,,,
16696,Question-and-Answer,,Chris Work,4392970
,,,,
16697,Question-and-Answer,"So as we push long term, we do think it's a program that can rollout internationally, has the potential to rollout internationally, I should say. We think it's a program that we can rollout further domestically. I don't think we are prepared at this time to say what percent of our digital share that's going to be, but we do think it's a program that could work in all metropolitan markets.",Chris Work,4392970
,,,,
16698,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. Fair enough. And then can you speak a little bit more about how you are thinking about and managing inventory in Q4? I guess, maybe where you feel like you might be running light? Or if there are areas where you feel like you may need to lean into a little more? Just wondering if there's anything around that.",Jeff Van Sinderen,4392970
,,,,
16699,Question-and-Answer,"Sure. Let me just kind of start with some of the numbers and if Rick would like to add anything in, we can go from there. Inventory, obviously, has been a rollercoaster. And our buying teams across all of our entities have just done a phenomenal job navigating through it from what seemed like a very difficult situation in Q1 and canceling orders and trying to get things right. And as you know, we ended the first quarter roughly flat in inventory year-over-year to then seeing our stores reopened and the incredible demand that we saw as stores were reopened and the online demand and we finished Q2 with inventory being down about 16%.",Chris Work,4392970
,,,,
16700,Question-and-Answer,"To get to down 12% continues to be that effort of chasing and really working with our brands to get product. And overall, we feel really good about where the inventory is at. As we move through Q4, we are being really opportunistic about where we are going to increase penetration. Our goal is not to be down 12%. We certainly would like to have some more inventory in certain key categories. But we have been chasing that and growing our inventory levels to meet the Q4 demand in where we think we need to be within our ecosystem. And as we move through the quarter, we expect to continue to make headway in the year where we would like to be.",Chris Work,4392970
,,,,
16701,Question-and-Answer,Do you feel like you have enough hard goods inventory given the supply chain constraints around that?,Jeff Van Sinderen,4392970
,,,,
16702,Question-and-Answer,"It's clearly been a challenge in a lot, but not just hard goods, it's been across a lot of categories of business over the last few months. And I would tell you that, again pretty much as Chris said, Jeff, we are getting sequentially better. So I feel like we are definitely better positioned in hard goods than we have been throughout the earlier parts of this year. We are better positioned now than we have been in most target categories now than we were earlier in this year. So I think our teams have done a really good job. I think we are prepared to meet the consumer demand. But it's been a challenge in a lot of areas.",Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16703,Question-and-Answer,"Footwear has been a major challenge in terms of supply chain for us. And that's where actually where we are down the most in inventory is in our footwear business. So I feel pretty good about where we are at. I think, as Chris said, our teams have done a really good job across the country and across our entities to really manage inventory and focus on the things that are most, as you might guess, most important in terms of where we are trending at this point. But in most cases, our skate hard goods department and categories are in a better position here in holiday than they have been earlier in the year.",Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16704,Question-and-Answer,Okay. Thanks and best of luck for holiday.,Jeff Van Sinderen,4392970
,,,,
16705,Question-and-Answer,Thank you.,Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16706,Question-and-Answer,"Thanks, Jeff.",Chris Work,4392970
,,,,
16707,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. Our next question comes from Jonathan Komp with Baird. Your line is now open.,Operator,4392970
,,,,
16708,Question-and-Answer,Yes. Hi. Thank you. Maybe just one quick follow-up on the delivery initiative. I see online it's quoted as a five to seven day window. I am wondering how that compares to your existing options and just any more perspective around speed for that initiative?,Jonathan Komp,4392970
,,,,
16709,Question-and-Answer,,Jonathan Komp,4392970
,,,,
16710,Question-and-Answer,Yes. We are pretty darn fast is the headline on Zumiez Delivery. So I think that just our team given a little bit of room to maneuver because we are usually in a day or two.,Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16711,Question-and-Answer,"And Jon, we totally encourage you to test this out. Order a few things.",Chris Work,4392970
,,,,
16712,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, order a lot of things for that matter, Jon. Let's see if we can get it to you really quickly in your market. So that's probably just our team being a little bit cautious in the early rollout in the markets we are in. But again, remember, we are not doing this system-wide at this point. We are only doing this in the 24 metropolitan markets that we are in today. So with room, if we need to, over the next few weeks to pull more triggers, depending on how we are doing in the marketplace, we can activate more markets. We are ready to activate more markets if we need to. But we are pretty darn fast on is the headline. I would say this. We are faster than any of the other options in our delivery menu.",Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16713,Question-and-Answer,"I am hopeful. But here, I don't know. I am in a target metro of yours in the top 20 stores, but I will take your word for it. Maybe one other quick follow-up, Chris. Just the thought on North America improving during the balance of the quarter. Any more color there on what you expect?",Jonathan Komp,4392970
,,,,
16714,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. Sure. I can talk a little bit about Q4, about how we are thinking about it. I mean, obviously, in our prepared remarks, we talked a little bit about what the cadence has looked like. In North America, included a positive week one, followed by a really solid week two and three and actually a really good lead up to Black Friday weekend, like I think many retailers will have reported or will report. Obviously, Thursday and Friday was definitely challenged by store closures, reduced hours, metered traffic, as we would expect. And then since then, things have been better. And so I think we are looking at Q4 very similarly to how we looked at Q3.",Chris Work,4392970
,,,,
16715,Question-and-Answer,"The peaks are just more challenged in this type of operating environment. We will not see the levels of mall traffic we have had and actually traffic overall. But yes, you are going to see that spread out much more. So our anticipation that's built into the general comments we gave around getting better than our current run rate and where we think North America will be is really built on the concept of, we will be stronger here as we move through these weeks, which are actually, for the better part of last five to 10 years have declined as the peaks have gotten more important, but we would expect that to be spread out a little bit here in these lower volume periods between the two peaks.",Chris Work,4392970
,,,,
16716,Question-and-Answer,"And then it will be more challenging the week of Christmas, as volumes have historically picked up and now maybe spread out a little wider. And then we could see after Christmas still be stronger, even into mid, late January. So that's what's built into our thought process for North America and how we are thinking about the remainder of Q4.",Chris Work,4392970
,,,,
16717,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. Just to echo Chris's comments, Jon, I think that's exactly what we think about it. It's going to be very similar to Q3. I think this is being driven by how consumers are thinking about the current environment and safety in this current environment and spreading out their spending probably for conservative reasons on their part, too. But I agree with Chris. I think we may think about, as we said, an improving trend line to where we are at today for the whole quarter.",Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16718,Question-and-Answer,"But as Chris said, that may take through the end of January to play out because there's no way that we can achieve our store volumes on the 26, with particularly, this year falls on a Saturday, 26, 27 and 28, we are talking monstrous days for us in stores when the kids always come in and use their gift cards. So I think that volume spreads out, as Chris has said, that volume also spreads out, potentially it spreads up all the way through the month of January.",Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16719,Question-and-Answer,,Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16720,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. And I would just add to your question, Jon. I know you didn't ask about international. But I do think it's important to talk a little bit or just about where Europe is. Obviously, the business has performed extremely well through the first nine months of the year, coming into the year with digital being about 50% of our sales. Even when the stores closed, it performed much better than the consolidated run rate. The second quarter and third quarter were really great results for the team there. And we are really proud of the progress that we have made.",Chris Work,4392970
,,,,
16721,Question-and-Answer,"Entering the fourth quarter, obviously, we have been more impacted by some of the governmental restraints over there with pretty significant closures here. We talked about 17% of our store days being closed through December 1, pretty significant reduced hours and maybe even more challenging is extended stay at home orders. So even where we are able to keep retail open, there is the encouragement that you should be home. And so it's really created a challenge and a slow start.",Chris Work,4392970
,,,,
16722,Question-and-Answer,"As I mentioned in my comments, we are down 30% in November and Q4 has always been very important for Blue Tomato and a higher penetration than our domestic business. And we are definitely feeling for the team working through these challenging times. That being said, they are doing awesome. They are doing everything they can to gain sales.",Chris Work,4392970
,,,,
16723,Question-and-Answer,"And we do anticipate or we are hoping, based on what we know today, that we will be opening stores here as we move into December, in the next week actually. And we are hoping that we see some of the pent-up demand we have seen when we had to open and close stores across the year in other markets. So definitely factored that into our guidance thoughts as well and we are hoping we are able to exceed that. We will see where the customer is at as we move through the quarter.",Chris Work,4392970
,,,,
16724,Question-and-Answer,"Got it. That's really helpful. And maybe just last one. Chris, you brought up a more normal cost environment looking into next year. Any more color on that? I mean, the fact that you have growing operating margin like you have year-to-date on a down sales number, should we be thinking of anchoring more towards 2019 operating margin as a starting point? Or just trying to read what you are signaling there?",Jonathan Komp,4392970
,,,,
16725,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. Totally a fair question, Jon and something we have definitely been thinking a lot about as we have been building budgets and moving into 2021. And obviously, let me just start by saying, we are extremely happy with where we stand from an income statement perspective and balance sheet perspective through the first nine months of the year. Our teams have reacted in a way that I don't think we ever could have anticipated. And so we are really proud of where we stand.",Chris Work,4392970
,,,,
16726,Question-and-Answer,"As we look to 2021, clearly, there's a lot of uncertainty in what that environment may look like. We are certainly not prepared to give guidance at this point. But we do think it's important to kind of lay out a few things. We are contemplating and hopefully, this helps answer your question, overall, we do expect sales to come back, assuming a more normalized operating environment, our ability for the customer to really come into stores and shop, how they want, when they want in the physical environment, while still utilizing the digital platform.",Chris Work,4392970
,,,,
16727,Question-and-Answer,"We are expecting quarter-to-quarter volatility in the financial results to be pretty significant, with the first quarter performing much stronger than what we saw here in 2020. The second quarter is going to be more challenged. And the third and fourth quarter, we are hoping to see more normalized results compared to where we have been. We are expecting product margin to be a pretty significant challenge, given the growth we have had this year. However, we are building plans to really maximize our results there and our teams are really thinking about this in a new way.",Chris Work,4392970
,,,,
16728,Question-and-Answer,,Chris Work,4392970
,,,,
16729,Question-and-Answer,"We are expecting more meaningful occupancy growth and step-ups in certain areas of the business as we are not planning on receiving rent abatements or governmental credits around payroll. And we are planning to reinstate some of these important cultural events you have heard us talk about over the years in trainings and travel as we continue to invest in our people. I mean, we think this is a really big differentiator of ours as we move through 2020 and something that's important for us to go back to as we look to a more normal operating environment.",Chris Work,4392970
,,,,
16730,Question-and-Answer,"Obviously, we expect hours to go back to normal, driving additional payroll expense and operating costs and all of that. It makes it hard for you guys and hard for us to predict what it looks like. But in 2019, we grew SG&A 4.7% on sales of 8.8%. We have done a good job, I think, managing SG&A. This year, in my prepared remarks, I talked about a decline of approximately 9%. It's currently where we are planning based on expense cuts and credits that we have discussed.",Chris Work,4392970
,,,,
16731,Question-and-Answer,"So as we think to 2021, at this point and obviously, we will update you more in March, we look at total SG&A dollars growing. I think looking at it in relation to 2019 is probably right. We actually would expect SG&A to grow even on 2019 levels in total dollars. But we certainly believe we can manage it lined as a percent of sales. As we think about where SG&A was as a percent of total sales in 2019 might be a better starting point as we look to 2021. So I think it will be a difficult operating environment. But I tell you, 2020 has given us even more confidence in our team's ability to navigate through it.",Chris Work,4392970
,,,,
16732,Question-and-Answer,Understood. That gives us plenty to contemplate. So thank you.,Jonathan Komp,4392970
,,,,
16733,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. Our last question comes from Mitch Kummetz with Pivotal Research. Your line is open.,Operator,4392970
,,,,
16734,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. Thanks for taking my questions. I have got a couple. Let me start with Europe. And on the snow business, can you say how much exposure you have to snow in the fourth quarter? And is the issue or part of the issue that some of these resorts might open? Or if they are open, they are closed? I know there have been some headlines around that. And I have got maybe a follow-up on that and then another question.",Mitch Kummetz,4392970
,,,,
16735,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. Mitch, that is exactly the issue we have in the snow business, which is there's always an issue of when it snows, but it always snows at some point, right. So usually, time has told us that that usually will, the volume will follow the actual weather conditions. The bigger challenge in Europe relative to the snow business at this point in time is related to pandemic. And right now, a lot of the resorts just simply can't open.",Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16736,Question-and-Answer,"And that is true in Austria, our home market, with Blue Tomato. There's going to be some restrictions in place for quite a while there yet. There's tourist restrictions for cross-border tourists coming into Austria to use the snow resorts there. So there is a lot of complications around this issue of just whether and how much the resorts are going to be able to be open for business during the season.",Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16737,Question-and-Answer,"And here that's been answered a bit differently, I would say, right, with the season passes and reservations to use the mountain, right. They have approached it differently here. But we are going to have the same challenges here in the U.S. in a different way and that's still not going to be a lot of tourism for traveling. As usual, like up here in the Northwest, a lot of trips to Whistler or up in the Central British Columbia. That just can't happen now. So we will see some of the same effects here, but differently. But Europe, it's definitely a more constrained environment in the snow business.",Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16738,Question-and-Answer,"Now, all that being said, Mitch, the other thing I would want to point about the snow business in Europe is that we have been diminishing snow as a percent of our total mix over the last number of years because we have been growing our store base. And as you are aware, the digital world attracts particularly larger portion of the snow business. So our store base and digital, snow business that tends to have lower margins in our apparel business.",Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16739,Question-and-Answer,,Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16740,Question-and-Answer,"So when doing this is one of the things that as we grow our store base in Europe, we will decrease our dependence upon the snow business while improving margins, as we do that, is kind of the magic of building scale in the marketplace. So that has been happening over the last few years. And as we continue our growth in the marketplace, we will continue to see, snow will still be important to us there, to be clear, but it will be a declining portion of our business as we grow our store base over the next five years.",Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16741,Question-and-Answer,"Got it. And then just a follow-up on Europe and then, again, one other question. So I guess, I am a little surprised to hear that Europe is down 30% quarter-to-date, despite all of the issues over there, partly because I know you guys have a very robust digital business in Europe, more robust than you do in North America. So as stores close and hours come down, I would have thought a lot of that volume would transfer online. Is that not happening with COVID kind of spiking again in Europe? Are people just not shopping in general? Or again, some of this, again, go back to decide that they are just not stopping for shopping for snow in general?",Mitch Kummetz,4392970
,,,,
16742,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. It's two things, I think, Mitch. The first is, as we just commented on is that the digital business had the disproportion of the snow business, right. So that is one aspect of it, for sure. Because you are not going to spend a lot on gear, if you are not going to be able to go to the mountains, right. I think that's the simple calculus there.",Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16743,Question-and-Answer,"And the second, I think, issue that's a factor in Europe is there's no additional stimulus with the shutdowns across virtually all the countries. And it's kind of the worst world for retailers in that sense is because they haven't shut retail down, but yet our operating hours are constrained. There's curfews in place. And in the case of Austria, our stores are actually closed. But there isn't as much stimulus in the economy to drive demand. So I think that's the other aspect of it that has been more difficult for the digital business in Europe.",Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16744,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. And then the last question was on footwear which was your worst comping segment in the quarter, I think it's been your most challenged segment for a few quarters now. Rick, you made the comment that it's the most challenged business from a supply chain standpoint. So does the comp performance reflect the supply chain situation? Or is there something else happening here? I know that I have covered you guys long enough to know that in response to some of these questions, you often talk about how things sort of cycle up, cycle down. I know that footwear is lapping a couple of years of really strong performance. But I am also wondering, is maybe some of the issues in footwear that with COVID there are these trends toward sort of fitness and comfort and that's not necessarily your sweet spot in footwear?",Mitch Kummetz,4392970
,,,,
16745,Question-and-Answer,"I am not prepared at this point to be able to answer that question, Mitch and partly because of the constraint in the supply chain. So when you lap a lot of inventory, it's hard to know what the issue is. So I am not prepared to, I don't think we know the answer to that question that you just asked at this point because it's hard to know until we have the product to do it and to really see where the demand is in the marketplace. And again, this isn't just a U.S. issue, this is a global issue for us with footwear. And so this has been one of the tougher performing businesses, again, supply chain wise across our global platform.",Rick Brooks,4392970
,,,,
16746,Question-and-Answer,"Now, we do have some things that are working in footwear. But again, I would tell you the same thing. Those things that are working, we don't have enough inventory of. So I know our partners here are working their hardest to get product in place for not only us but for all of their partners and probably for their own direct businesses. So I think that what transpired in footwear is just that it's such a size-intensive business that when the pandemic hit, people took some pretty dramatic actions relative to managing their own inventories and supply chain structure. And it takes them a lot longer to get it fired back up again, particularly with the size complexity you have in footwear. So I can't answer the question because I simply don't know. It's hard to make that read with no inventory.",Rick Brooks,4392970

,,,,
16759,Presentation,"Thank you, Roxanne. Good afternoon, everyone. Before I begin my prepared remarks, I would like to thank every Medallian for their hard work in 2020. As evidenced by the quote from IDC?s Alan Webber in our earnings press release, companies seek to engage their customers and employees with more intent than ever. It's crystal clear that customer and employee feedback gained from broad and deep information sources, including digital dialogues, voice, video and ideas, provides organizations with powerful insights and direction. In recent research detailing IDC?s nine future enterprise agenda elements, it was reported that customer experience programs have risen from eighth position to second in the priority list in the last year. Medallia?s unique ability to capture, organize and distribute feedback, deliver powerful insights and great critical actions, is key to our future growth in existing, new and emerging markets. ",Leslie Stretch,4392969
,,,,
16760,Presentation,,Leslie Stretch,4392969
,,,,
16761,Presentation,"Turning to a review our Q3, I was very pleased with our performance in the quarter. We continued to operate a completely virtual business and had our best new logo quarter ever. Increasingly, we see customers asking for one provider of voice of customer, voice of employee as well as market research, text analytics, social listening, video, voice, ideas and messaging. I believe that Medallia is unique in having all of these technologies today. ",Leslie Stretch,4392969
,,,,
16762,Presentation,"And since we have record revenue and record recurring revenue, and our operating income exceeded expectations again, we grew our SaaS revenue by 22%. We added 64 new logos in our enterprise business and our mid-market growth continues to deliver. We had over 90 go lives, almost a 40% increase from Q3 last year. We also had more than 20 partner led implementations, including some of the larger projects. We now have over 1,000 enterprise customers. Our new log activity underlines the importance of our broader signal capture, deep engagement technology and robust communications capabilities. New logos accounted for almost 50% of new bookings, as compared to approximately 35% for prior quarters. ",Leslie Stretch,4392969
,,,,
16763,Presentation,"New logos accounted for almost 50% of new bookings as compared to approximately 35% for prior quarters. New logos included Deutsche Telekom, Jaguar Land Rover in the UK, Modelo Brewing in Colombia, KeyBanc in North America, National Bank of Canada, Radisson Hotels in the U.S., a major electronics manufacturer in Singapore; a non-profit financial services company in Central America, our first new logo with our new partner, IZO; Bradesco in Brazil, giving us 2 of the top 3 banks in Brazil and 5 of the top 10 banks in Latin America. We also signed Woodside Homes in Utah and Jackson Hewitt Tax Services. ",Leslie Stretch,4392969
,,,,
16764,Presentation,"In the public sector we had notable wins at the GSA, FEMA, City of Tempe, City of San Diego and Her Majesty's Land Registry. During the pandemic, a large pharmaceutical company plans to use Medallia Digital to provide vaccine information to healthcare providers and patients. McDonald's in Australia is already using Medallia for contact tracing. ",Leslie Stretch,4392969
,,,,
16765,Presentation,"Our renewals also went well in the quarter with strong multiyear renewal cross-sell and upsell action. A major insurer renewed for $11 million in total contract value. A major Japanese conglomerate expanded and renewed in a $5 million total contract value agreement. A major technology hardware company renewed $9 million in total contract value and one of the world's largest consumer technology and communications businesses renewed for $3 million in total contract value. We also had some retailers again renewed our commitments, one renewed for over $6 million in total contract value and another for over $3 million. And a cruise line renewed for $4 million in total contract value. ",Leslie Stretch,4392969
,,,,
16766,Presentation,"Turning to our acquired technology. Contributions from our tuck-ins are small so far but fast growing, and I'm very pleased with new bookings from our acquired technologies, resulting in good new logos and some seven figure commitments. In addition, the industry analysts group have commended our approach to building out the platform in this manner. Specifically, we've made four technology focused acquisitions this year that expand feedback, signal capture, and the engagement and action-oriented capabilities of our platform. We work closely with our customers who see these as essential experience management technologies. The breadth of our platform is a key competitive differentiator as evidenced by our new logo and competitive win rate success. ",Leslie Stretch,4392969
,,,,
16767,Presentation,I'm pleased about our recently strengthened contact center offering combined with the power of Medallia with our new speech and frontline engagement capabilities. ,Leslie Stretch,4392969
,,,,
16768,Presentation,"Since the acquisition of Voci, which now forms the core of Medallia Speech, we have signed several six figure deals with large financial institutions, a seven figure deal with a large retailer, along with several other six figure deals across a broad range of verticals. Our Q3 addition of Stella Connect for contact center agents has been well received by customers showing good promise for Q4 and beyond. Stella Connect brings the power of feedback to the live-time environment of the contact center, and specifically adds potent capabilities to the new virtual service center world that is emerging today. This opportunity is important for now and the future and the Stella capability is a central element of our partnership with Five9 which we announced this week. ",Leslie Stretch,4392969
,,,,
16769,Presentation,,Leslie Stretch,4392969
,,,,
16770,Presentation,"With Stella we've already sold into the e-commerce division of three large retail customers, added one of the world's largest game publishers, Riot Games, and StockX, one of the fastest growing e-commerce companies. These deals are significant on their own, but importantly, represent new entry points for Medallia's core experienced cloud offering. Sense360 recently acquired initial use case with a quick-serve restaurant space which has pivoted the curbside pickup and delivery. There's also an emerging retail proposition, the proposition is well understood by existing Medallia customers. And this is a natural cross-sell. These and our acquisitions are important not just because of their contribution to future new cross-sell and upsell bookings but because they bring us customers with contracts, making it simpler to cross-sell Medallia Experience Cloud and the Medallia Digital to new prospects. ",Leslie Stretch,4392969
,,,,
16771,Presentation,"Highlighting our core platform, it's noteworthy that our digital capture technology and Medallia Experience Cloud is seeing dramatic growth of digital signals. We had some of our largest digital programs go live in Q3, including one of the largest Canadian banks and one of the largest automotive manufacturers in the world and one of the largest consumer electronics companies in the world. Specifically, a large U.S. bank has rolled out this technology to over 30 million mobile app users. And this is the use case we can repeat everywhere. Year-over-year we've seen a nearly 50% increase in our digital customers. ",Leslie Stretch,4392969
,,,,
16772,Presentation,"Combining digital technology with Medallia Experience Cloud and Stella Connect delivers real savings and speed of resolution in contact center use cases. One large property and casualty insurer realized in one area a 28% reduction in wasteful and time consuming call center calls as a result of deployment Medallia Digital. In another case, a major retailer deployed Medallia Digital Feedback combined with web analytics across customer experience and e-commerce teams, discovering and resolving quickly a single issue that was worth a potential $5 million per month in lost revenue. Both these examples proving the clear ROI of our solutions. ",Leslie Stretch,4392969
,,,,
16773,Presentation,"On the product front, we're expanding language support for Medallia Speech with 7 key languages being added to our portfolio. Our messaging platform Zingle achieved HIPAA compliance in the quarter. We announced Medallia?s conversations to deliver sentiment based adaptive surveys, delivering smarter customer interactions faster and increasing customer response rates. For our core platform, we added Zoom, Slack and Teams integrations and added customer life cycle mapping in our customer success model.",Leslie Stretch,4392969
,,,,
16774,Presentation,"Turning to employee engagement and experience, we've added our digital employee experience solution enabling HR to get in-the-moment feedback from employees through a micro post digital interaction. Just this November, we went live with one of our largest employee experience implementations, putting over 300,000 employees of a company on the platform. We started our integrator influencer technology partnerships in the quarter. We now have 40 implementation targets, a 70% increase from the year ago. Our service Quickstart solution for ServiceNow makes it easy for customers to share in-the-moment feedback. ",Leslie Stretch,4392969
,,,,
16775,Presentation,"Medallia Tableau Connector brings together Medallia's best-in-class experience insights with Tableau's advanced analytics and data visualization capabilities. We formalized a new partner agreement with Oracle and Ipsos in Medallia, partnered to close Jaguar, Land Rover, a new win that I highlighted earlier.",Leslie Stretch,4392969
,,,,
16776,Presentation,"We saw continued acceleration with Deloitte. We signed a new reseller agreement and had several joint wins with Deloitte?s government practice. Additionally, we signed over a dozen new ISV partners, including [Vizia], [Ipsos] in Latin America and KPMG in the UK. Our professional services business continues to be a strong differentiator for us, and this is made clear by direct feedback from our customers and our own Medallia implementation. We again delivered a strong go-live revenue and margin performance in Q3.",Leslie Stretch,4392969

16778,Presentation,"As I previously mentioned, industry analysts are very positive about our technology roadmap. This week, we were proud to be named a leader in the inaugural Gartner Magic Quadrant for our space and received the highest placement for completeness of vision. You can download a copy of the report from our website. We are thrilled to be named the leader and recognized for our vision. We believe this result is a testament to our customers who helped shape our vision and roadmap and our employees who are the best in the business. It's clear that we have the deepest functionality for collecting and analyzing direct, indirect and inferred feedback, and that we have strong partner relationships. We also can confirm that we have the highest percentage of client programs with over 1,000 users, as well as the highest average number of departments for clients using our software out of all experienced management vendors.

,,,,
16780,Presentation,"So now with three pandemic quarters behind us, we're pleased with the company's consistent performance. We see solid growth in our business. We have had a strong start to Q4, again underlined by a 7-figure life sciences deal already executed. And so we're providing today a high-level preliminary view of the coming year. Our projections reflect our confidence in our diversified end user markets, product roadmap and technology leadership. However, It's important to point out our projections do not depend on a significant recovery in the travel and hospitality space where we have a strong presence. As we grow, we intend to continue to invest in sales, marketing and product to meet the needs of a very significant market opportunity. ",Leslie Stretch,4392969
,,,,
16781,Presentation,I'll now hand over to Roxanne for her report on our financial performance in Q3 and forward projections.,Leslie Stretch,4392969
,,,,
16782,Presentation,"Thank you, Leslie. And good afternoon, everyone. We reported strong financial results in Q3 including record total revenue and record SaaS revenue. As a quick reminder, unless otherwise noted, all numbers except revenue mentioned during my remarks today are non-GAAP. You can find a reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP results in today's press release. Total revenue for Q3 was $121 million, it increased at $18 million, or 17% over Q3 of fiscal 2020. In Q3 subscription revenues were $96.9 million, an increase of $17 million or 22% year-over-year. Q3 included approximately $600,000 of subscription revenue from the acquisition of Sense360, which was announced subsequent to the earnings call, and thus, was not contemplated in our prior guidance.",Roxanne Oulman ,4392969
,,,,
16783,Presentation,"As we've noted on the past few calls, we have modified subscription terms, flexible payments, or invoicing terms, in exchange for extensions of existing contracts for certain customers hardest hit by the pandemic. On average, the extension period works for one additional year. Consistent with what we projected on our last earnings call, the modified subscription terms have negatively impacted our subscription revenue in Q3 by approximately $1 million and by approximately $2 million on a year-to-date basis.",Roxanne Oulman ,4392969
,,,,
16784,Presentation,"We expect a similar impact in Q4 of fiscal 2021 and in Q1 of fiscal 2022 as we lapped this. It's important to keep in mind that this has no impact on our long-term current economics. As a reminder, the majority of our contracts are multiyear, irrevocable, include contracted minimums, and we expect your customers to honor their agreements. Professional services revenue was $24 million for the quarter, which increased 3% year-over-year. Recurring managed services revenue accounts for more than 50% of our total professional services revenue, which is consistent with recent quarters. As a result, recurring revenue continues to be at 90% of total revenue.",Roxanne Oulman ,4392969
,,,,
16785,Presentation,,Roxanne Oulman ,4392969
,,,,
16786,Presentation,"Turning to some key metrics. We continue to see strong growth in new logos. We ended the quarter with over 1,000 enterprise customers, an increase nearly 45% year-over-year. In Q3, we added 64 new enterprise logos and approximately a 100 from our acquisitions of Stella Connect and Sense360.",Roxanne Oulman ,4392969
,,,,
16787,Presentation,"For the 12 months ended October 31, 2020, our dollar-based net retention rate was 115%. Customer M&A and bankruptcy drove the change in our net retention rate. We believe our strong net retention rate underscores the ROI our platform provides and our ability to retain and steadily expand businesses within our existing customer base. ",Roxanne Oulman ,4392969
,,,,
16788,Presentation,"Turning for RPO or remaining performance obligations. As I have shared with you previously, our RPO metrics may be impacted by contract duration and extensions, as well as timing of renewals of multiyear contracts. So while RPO provides for strong visibility, it may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. As of October 31st, total RPO was $732 million, an increase of 25% year-over-year. Current RPO, which is the amount we expect to recognize as revenue over the next 12 months totaled $346 million, an increase of 19% year-over-year. Non-current RPO totaled $386 million, an increase of 31% year-over-year. We are now facing tougher comparables in the non-current RPO metric on a year -- versus a year ago basis as a result of our success last year in signing multiyear renewals.",Roxanne Oulman ,4392969
,,,,
16789,Presentation,"I'll now turn to our non-GAAP gross margins and operating expenses. Subscription gross margin -- subscription revenue gross margin was 81.1% compared to 81.5% in the year ago quarter. In Q3 professional services gross margin was 16.1% compared to 16.5% in Q3 of the last year. We continue to focus on building out our partner ecosystem. So, we expect professional services gross margin moving to between 10% to 12% in Q4. Sales and marketing expenses in Q3 were $46.3 million or 38% of revenue. R&D expenses were $22.9 million for the quarter or 19% of revenue. R&D remains an important investment area, as we expand our platform. G&A expenses were $11.2 million or 9% of revenue in the quarter. We expect additional leverage on the G&A line over the longer-term. ",Roxanne Oulman ,4392969
,,,,
16790,Presentation,"Non-GAAP operating margin in the quarter was 1.7%, compared to a negative 2% in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP net income was $1.1 million compared to a loss of $900,000 in Q3 of last year.",Roxanne Oulman ,4392969
,,,,
16791,Presentation,"Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $657.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, current and non-current marketable securities. The increase in cash included the proceeds of approximately $497 million from the convertible note offering in September. In connection with the convert in order to reduce potential dilution, we purchased a capped call that upon conversion, the notes will not be diluted until the stock price is $58.30 per share or higher. Subscription deferred revenue was $172.1 million, an increase of 21% over the prior year.",Roxanne Oulman ,4392969
,,,,
16792,Presentation,"Let's move on to discuss subscription billings, which we define as subscription revenue, plus change in sequential subscription deferred revenue and contract assets. As you know, there are a wide variety of factors that influence this metric. Therefore, quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in billings should not be taken as an indication of changes in future revenue. We believe that the 12 month trailing subscription billings growth rate is a more meaningful measure of our performance. For Q3 of fiscal 2021, our trailing 12 month subscription billings growth rate was 20%. On a trailing 12 month basis, subscription billings were negatively impacted by approximately $5 million, due to new bookings with invoicing terms that ramp over a multiyear period.",Roxanne Oulman ,4392969
,,,,
16793,Presentation,"Now turning to cash flow. We used $14.9 million in cash from operations during the quarter, representing an operating cash flow margin of negative 12%, an improvement from the negative 18% we generated in Q3 of last year. As a reminder, we historically experienced seasonality in cash flow from operations, given that over 40% of our billings occur in the fourth quarter. As a result, our operating cash flow has been positive in Q1 and Q4, followed by cash flow from operations, being negative in both Q2 and Q3, as it has been for the past few years. We anticipate this seasonality to continue.",Roxanne Oulman ,4392969
,,,,
16794,Presentation,,Roxanne Oulman ,4392969
,,,,
16795,Presentation,"Moving to guidance. For Q4, we are projecting total revenue to be between $123.5 million and $125.5 million, representing a growth rate of 12% to 14% year-over-year. We expect subscription revenue to be in the range of a $100.5 million to $101.5 million, representing growth of 17% to 18% year-over-year. For Q4, we expect non-GAAP operating income to be in a range of $200,000 to $700,000. We expect other income and expense to be an expense between $500,000 and $800,000, primarily due to interest expense associated with the convert and reduced interest rate environment. ",Roxanne Oulman ,4392969
,,,,
16796,Presentation,"We project income taxes to be in the range of $500,000 to $1 million. We anticipate basic weighted shares outstanding to be approximately 151 million and fully diluted weighted shares outstanding to be approximately 180 million. ",Roxanne Oulman ,4392969
,,,,
16797,Presentation,"Finally, we anticipate our capital expenditures in Q4 to be approximately $5 million primarily related to enhancing our data centers to meet our customers? demand. On a full year basis, we are projecting total revenue of $472.7 million to $474.7 million, representing a growth rate of 17% to 18%. Professional services revenue growth is projected to be in the low single-digits, as we have significantly expanded the number of delivery partners this year as Leslie discussed previously. ",Roxanne Oulman ,4392969
,,,,
16798,Presentation,"In addition, we continue to reduce implementation costs through our preconfigured industry packaged solutions. For fiscal 2021, we are projecting subscription revenue of $379.3 million to $380.3 million, representing a subscription revenue growth rate of 22% over the prior year. Note that we estimate that the COVID concessions will create a headwind of approximately $3 million. We expect the acquisitions we made in Q3 to contribute a little over 1% to our fiscal 2021 subscription revenue. ",Roxanne Oulman ,4392969
,,,,
16799,Presentation,"For fiscal 2021, we expect basic weighted shares outstanding to be approximately 145 million and fully diluted weighted shares outstanding to be approximately 176 million. ",Roxanne Oulman ,4392969

16800,Presentation,"Looking ahead, while we have not finalized our fiscal 2022 planning cycle, we'd like to provide a preliminary outlook for next year as we remain confident in our execution, diversified end user market, product roadmap and leadership position. For fiscal 2022, we expect total revenue to be approximately $555 million with subscription revenue of approximately $457 million. ",Roxanne Oulman ,4392969

16804,Question-and-Answer,"Great, thank you so much for taking my questions and congrats on a nice quarter. Maybe first for Leslie. Leslie, as more of your customers touchpoints with their customers and users go more digital versus physical, and will likely only be more so digital into the future, how has that changing the needs of customer experience management? Does it make it easier for you to help close the feedback loop and highlight the value of your solutions? How is that helping if at all drive more business? ",Brad Zelnick,4392969
,,,,
16805,Question-and-Answer,"I think that's a great question to answer, thank you. I think that the digital story really plays into our early investments. We invested earlier than anybody else in the digital technology. If you think about it the way people -- every customer journey, every employee journey has now changed, has become more intense and strong, it?s faster, it?s more urgent and all that speaks to technologies that serve that communication situation. And so -- and our conversations technology, our digital technology, our instant voice, video, and so on, all really create much more effective powerful responses than just surveys. Survey is still important. But if that's all you've got in your back then that is a different type of communication medium, longer winded, more orientated to the physical world. And so I think we're beautifully positioned. And actually remind you, with the spectrum of digital capture that we have, everything is speeded up, journeys have changed, everything is shorter, everything is more intense. And I highlighted in the prepared remarks that we had 50% growth in digital customers and I highlighted some of the large digital rollouts that are an effect of what you just described in your question. ",Leslie Stretch,4392969
,,,,
16806,Question-and-Answer,,Leslie Stretch,4392969
,,,,
16807,Question-and-Answer,"And maybe just follow-up for Roxanne. Roxanne, can you share with us what your assumptions are for the initial fiscal '22 guide that you?ve shared? ",Brad Zelnick,4392969
,,,,
16808,Question-and-Answer,"So we put our fiscal '22 together, our guidance, and as you know, we're still in our planning process, we really looked at the strength of the business that we've experienced in the last two quarters, and also the strength in our pipeline. And based on what I see, and confident with what we've provided for our fiscal FY '22 guidance and we?ve posted 22% or we are guidance with 22% subscription growth rate this year. And we're excited about what we see overall, and we're not anticipating that there will be any significant recovery in travel or hospitality in FY '22.",Roxanne Oulman,4392969
,,,,
16809,Question-and-Answer,Your next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow from Wells Fargo. ,Operator,4392969
,,,,
16810,Question-and-Answer,"I really want to drill into the employee experience side that was something that you highlighted over the past couple quarters. We've heard some -- from some other vendors into the traditional ATM space about the success of return to work applications. So my question for both, you Leslie and Roxanne. But when we're talking to customers about employee experience, what are you hearing from them in terms of sort of planning for return to work and also tying that together with customer experience? And then just a one quick follow up to that. ",Phil Winslow,4392969
,,,,
16811,Question-and-Answer,"I think the situation that we're in still is that this whole situation is highlighted the need to communicate more effectively and faster, with normal modern and exciting mediums instead of the annual 360 review, which is kind of the domain of the traditional HR players to be honest. And so what we're seeing is people want to create safe spaces for employee groups in different constituencies. They want to have global communication, global virtual communication, they want to have the ability to toggle between anonymity and ID communication and dialogues and we want to be able to ask questions at any time and not depend on a structured sort of old school survey. And so that's really coming to the floor. We mentioned I think on our last call that we've added quite a number of new large employee experience customers and I highlighted in my prepared remarks, we had one very large -- and we are not allowed to name them, but one very large deployment just go live. And so it's really critical. But I think in everybody I talk to everyday, even yesterday talking to a major organization, it's number one priority to create this connective tissue. And at the moment, they're served 360 degree reviews, periodic surveys and what I would regard as old technology effort. So I think we're very well positioned but it's a permanent feature of the people in the future. ",Leslie Stretch,4392969
,,,,
16812,Question-and-Answer,"I think people were called out in not having this type of communications capability in place as the pandemic began. So I don't think we're going to go back once a year, asking our colleagues, our employees, our team members, how they think we're doing or how things are, that is going to go away, it's got to be a consistent and a safe communication place and our digital technology creates that. ",Leslie Stretch,4392969
,,,,
16813,Question-and-Answer,"Then just one follow up, as you've noted some customer wins this quarter, one of ways was actually in the hospitality space, hotel, restaurants, obviously some of the more impacted industries here, which I think is surprising, some people that may be spending anything right now. But when do you think about the reserve, what do you do in business with some of the impacted issues, what are they telling you about why they are prioritizing spend on Medallia now?",Phil Winslow,4392969
,,,,
16814,Question-and-Answer,"Well, over the prior reasons in the employee context, all of those messages really apply to customers too, deeper, more persistent connection. On the hospitality -- the corporate side of hospitality, as Roxanne said, we don't expect and are not planning on a return there. We don't need that to make the projection. But the domestic travel, the leisure travel sector has had some recovery. But this particular business, it's a decent-sized commitment as well. They just want to be ready for that phased return, the domestic traveler, the leisure traveler, and the corporate traveler, and so on. And they actually do have some decent occupancy. So, they do need the feedback technology, they have tried other survey technologies in the past, and they want to move to a modern, all integrated platform, voice, video, et cetera, all of the offerings that we have. ",Leslie Stretch,4392969
,,,,
16815,Question-and-Answer,,Leslie Stretch,4392969
,,,,
16816,Question-and-Answer,"But I also highlighted renewals. And the reason I highlighted those renewals is because some of them were what we consider to be stress areas. And I don't want to embarrass or identify any company there. But it's important that even in distressed times, they're making multimillion dollar commitments to this digital technology. That's been very encouraging. And my team has been there, that renewal team, large renewal team has been there throughout the year. ",Leslie Stretch,4392969
,,,,
16817,Question-and-Answer,Your next question comes from the line of Tom Roderick from Stifel. Please go ahead. ,Operator,4392969
,,,,
16818,Question-and-Answer,"So Leslie, I guess I'd like to start with you. I mean, you rattle off a number of the seven and eight figure deal renewals in the quarter, number of different industries. And if we think back to the March quarter and the feedback at that point, I remember you calling out that large deals were harder to come by, you're going to focus a little bit more on midsized deals and paring them down. And then what we saw in the summer, and then certainly what it seems like in the fall is sort of a renewal of this large deal activity. So, I was hoping you could sort of more broadly speak to the demand environment for those seven and eight figure deals. And in particular, if you could sort of talk about those renewals? Were you seeing notable upsells from customers? cross-sales? Were they purchasing more expanding usage as part of the renewals? Just some more commentary on some of those bigger deals that you highlighted would be really helpful. ",Tom Roderick ,4392969
,,,,
16819,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, great question. So, this is not actually by in cyclical terms our biggest renewal quarter, Q3 is not our biggest renewal quarter. But that's another reason I wanted to highlight those renewals. But I think the key thing in the month of early March is that nearly 50% of bookings came from new wins and new competitive wins in many cases where we saw survey market research players putting in low-ball deals and they weren't successful as we were. We won the lion's share of the enterprise logos. And so we had that, we have the renewals. And we also have this now a year old, very young, mid-market business really performing as well. And so it's really across the spectrum. Our goal was to have nice, even",Leslie Stretch,4392969
,,,,
16820,Question-and-Answer,"no drama quarters where we're getting something from mid-market, our renewals are solid and we're getting some decent share and actually more than our fair share of the enterprise deals.",Leslie Stretch,4392969
,,,,
16821,Question-and-Answer,"So I think that Q4 is actually an interesting quarter for us and it's one of our bigger renewals quarter, so it?s one of our harder compares. But I think the new business and renewal and upsell and cross-sell mix will continue. But the key highlight was nearly 50% from new bookings in Q3 was just one of the highs we've ever had.",Leslie Stretch,4392969
,,,,
16822,Question-and-Answer,"Roxanne follow-up for you. Just I think, if I heard you correctly, and I know you've been getting a lot of questions about the acquisition contributions, I think you might have said 1% of fiscal '21 revenues coming from acquisitions. So perhaps you could repeat that. But then independent to that, knowing that those acquisitions were more back end loaded, when they closed and how they'll contribute to GAAP revenues, could you provide a sort of a like-for-like compare of how we ought to think about that -- those acquisitions contributing to your initial look at FY '22? And if the answer is we can't project what they're going to do or we don't know exactly, perhaps, if you could just take it annualized look at and what those acquisitions were in cumulative fashion, and then apply that. But just any more commentary you can have, as you constructed your fiscal '22 guidance? Thank you.",Tom Roderick,4392969
,,,,
16823,Question-and-Answer,"You?re right, Tom. What I shared on the call is that the revenue from -- the acquired revenue from the acquisition is very immaterial. When we make these acquisitions, we are looking for technology and we are looking for an opportunity to really take this and grow it. As we have and Leslie shared with you on the call that we've had some very successful wins with our Medallia Speech product. We've had several six figure and we've had seven figure deals. And we're very focused on using this technology to build out the best possible platform. And you're seeing that in industry in large, you're seeing that in our new logos. And you're seeing that in the feedback that we get from our customers. And as we have shared with the previous one, when we make these acquisitions, we do work closely with our customers. So the amount that it impacts this year is nominal, and the amount that it impacts next year is nominal. What we're focused on is building out this platform and our ability to continue to cross-sell and upsell this technology as successfully as we have at this point.",Roxanne Oulman,4392969
,,,,
16824,Question-and-Answer,,Roxanne Oulman,4392969
,,,,
16825,Question-and-Answer,Your next question comes from the line of Scott Berg from Needham & Company.,Operator,4392969
,,,,
16826,Question-and-Answer,"I guess, two for me. First of all, Leslie, you announced a partnership of Five9 this week. And the company has been active -- Medallia has been active in the contact center space trying to I guess nudge your way and there was a couple of acquisitions. Could you talk about that relationship, what it gives you and maybe where your functionality in the contact center starts or ends versus where it?s today?",Scott Berg ,4392969
,,,,
16827,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, it's a great question. So brand-new partnerships, I've just announced. So I think there's a multitude of solicited, unsolicited signals that can be collected outside of the call center that give a much richer view of the customer. You combine that feedback with some of the absolutely vital data that Five9 collects, think of all the voice data that they collect, and you get a much more powerful picture of customer. And we have some good joint customers and some good joint initiatives underway. Early days in the partnership, but it makes perfect sense to have that connection.",Leslie Stretch,4392969
,,,,
16828,Question-and-Answer,"Our Stella Connect product is really complementary, again, because it's using the feedback data sources to create their coaching, their live in-the-minute coaching scripts and ideas and distribute those to now distributed virtual service center people. So I think the combination actually helps deliver this idea of service rather than just responding contact center environments. Those are changing. I'm certain Five9 is a leader in that space. So really happy with that partnership.",Leslie Stretch,4392969
,,,,
16829,Question-and-Answer,"Got it. Helpful. And then last question on the M&A front. 2020 and circling back half of 2019 has been active for you guys. As you look forward over the next 12 to 18 months, do you think the pace of acquisitions for the company changes materially? Or is it really just being opportunistic in terms of what you see at any one point in time?",Scott Berg,4392969
,,,,
16830,Question-and-Answer,"Well, without giving everything away, I mean, I think there are technologies that we really like that some of -- which we're building. We're building more than we buy or building a ton of things. I gave some small summary of some of the product developments underway at the moment.",Leslie Stretch ,4392969
,,,,
16831,Question-and-Answer,"But there's always opportunities. The market presents opportunities, and we're always on the lookout. We have to be. There are some -- there are -- the beauty of this platform is that there are a number of signals, a number of AI technologies number of data technologies that we really like. And so I expect that we'll continue. Right now, we're about focusing in on execution for the remainder of this year. But I expect us to continue as other SaaS companies do to take opportunities as and when they arise. We're well financed to do that. It's just part of our process and approach. But right now, let's focus on executing for the remainder of the year.",Leslie Stretch ,4392969
,,,,
16832,Question-and-Answer,Your next question comes from the line of Rob Oliver from Baird.,Operator,4392969
,,,,
16833,Question-and-Answer,"Great. I also just wanted to touch on the renewals, Leslie and recognizing that obviously, but as you mentioned, half of the new bookings came from new logos. I'm just curious though, you mentioned the cruise line, and I guess a follow-up to Tom's question, and you didn't want to call out any particular industry but a $4 million multiyear renewal with a particularly distressed industry. I'm just curious, with all of the technology tuck-ins that you guys have made over the past year, a very small revenue contribution right now. But when you look at something like a cruise line or other distressed industries, when you come into a renewal with those sorts of customers, how much additional leverage does it give you guys? And how much of an opportunity does it give you to park the innovative new technologies with those customers who might otherwise be maybe looking at down spend in this environment? And then I had a quick follow-up.",Rob Oliver ,4392969
,,,,
16834,Question-and-Answer,,Rob Oliver ,4392969
,,,,
16835,Question-and-Answer,"That's a great question. I think that we -- certainly, our breadth of offerings and our modularization of the offerings gives us fungibility and gives us the ability to add value. That's not really been a big feature. These have been more apples-for-apples types of renewals. And actually, these companies believe they have futures, and they have started out quite bright futures actually. And so they are very positive and upbeat about their future. And this is part of their investment to be connected deeply for the future.",Leslie Stretch ,4392969
,,,,
16836,Question-and-Answer,"So we actually do expect -- we haven't had much revenue from the acquisitions. We do actually expect upsell and cross-sell bookings as a result. We don't expect that to use them as concessions to keep people on the hook. We haven't had to. But so I would say in travel and hospitality, we don't -- we're not depending on some magical vaccine-driven recovery there. We don't need that for our projections.",Leslie Stretch ,4392969
,,,,
16837,Question-and-Answer,"But actually, what we've seen in dialogues with that sector, which is very important, is that people are determined. They've learned a lot. And they won't have a dialogue with their customers right now, even if it's a quieter time for them, to prepare for the future. What do you expect from PPE and safety? What do you expect from the way we conduct our operations in the future, pandemic, post-pandemic? So they want to have that dialogue, and so they really need the technology and the connection.",Leslie Stretch ,4392969
,,,,
16838,Question-and-Answer,"Great. That's helpful, Leslie. And then, Roxanne, I think you said that on -- the billings had been -- with a $5 million impact to billings that had gone into multiyear contracts. I'm just curious if that is also a component of some of the relief that you guys are providing to customers. And I apologize, I think you might have alluded to that previously, but the ability to renew over a longer time frame.",Rob Oliver ,4392969
,,,,
16839,Question-and-Answer,"So what I was referring to when I was talking about the billings impact is that we have had limited situations with new customers that we ramp the invoicing over time. So we may invoice them less in the first year than we invoice them in the second year. And so you're seeing that, that is providing some headwinds.",Roxanne Oulman ,4392969
,,,,
16840,Question-and-Answer,"And so what we're really focused on is all customers at this point in all industries. We think we have a product that everyone can use that is essential not only today but is essential in the future. And we're working with every customer. New -- we have new customers who -- life sciences and health care customers, for example, that using Medallia and using this technology is completely different. And so if we have -- if we're providing ramped billing and that helps them as they become -- as they continue to grow and build their platform, that's very effective for both of us. So we're really pleased about what we're seeing overall.",Roxanne Oulman ,4392969
,,,,
16841,Question-and-Answer,Your next question comes from the line of Richard Baldry from ROTH Capital.,Operator,4392969
,,,,
16842,Question-and-Answer,So turning back to acquisition potential. Seen a fairly expensive one completed of late by another SaaS vendor of material scale. So how do you see price expectations changing in sort of the companies you're talking to? Do you think it's still rational? Or is there some of that rationality sort of dissipating in your communications?,Richard Baldry ,4392969
,,,,
16843,Question-and-Answer,"That's a great question. Of course, we were in a bit of a flagged deal, because we didn't quite step up there also and couldn't find enough money under the sofa. But look, we are not -- in our history as a management team, as you know, is not to be irrational buyers. We're very frugal with our investors' and customers' money overall. We're looking at -- that's why we like early-stage winners and technology that tend not to have invested much in sales and marketing, which is why they don't have a lot of revenue contribution in the early days. We've done very well from that.",Leslie Stretch ,4392969
,,,,
16844,Question-and-Answer,,Leslie Stretch ,4392969
,,,,
16845,Question-and-Answer,"If you look back at our digital product now, there was an acquisition years ago. It's done extremely well. If you look at our ideas technology, has done very well, messaging and so on. And so we're going to keep that kind of target criteria if you like. We do talk to private companies, right? They always -- private companies always think they're worth way more than they may really be because they haven't had the discipline at the public market, making money, looking at billings, looking at growing their business consistently and steadily. And so we're not interested in overpaying. We're not that yet. We're not that scaled yet. We're interested in smart technologies to. Got a few things. Don't want to reveal them to our competitors who always listen to this call. So we really are going to keep that kind of criteria.",Leslie Stretch ,4392969
,,,,
16846,Question-and-Answer,"Right now it's about executing in Q4, setting us up for next year and actually hiring more mid-market salespeople around the world. We've got some pretty stiff targets. We actually have enough sales capacity to do our projections, but that shouldn't mean that we should stop investing in sales and marketing. And we've got a big build program underway. Our road map is massive, and we're spending a lot of time and money on that. And so all of those things are important.",Leslie Stretch ,4392969
,,,,
16847,Question-and-Answer,"And turning back to when you just touched on a little bit. But in your wins of people like FEMA or GSA, who maybe they're a bit more active in a COVID-type environment, but I don't tend to think of government agencies as particularly interested in service and what people think of them given their monopolies are positioned. So maybe can you walk us through sort of the mentality behind dealing with federal or any government entities versus private industry, what you see there and how broadly you think you can penetrate those types of markets?",Richard Baldry ,4392969
,,,,
16848,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. Well, that is a great question. Thank you for that. And -- but I respectfully disagree with you on this one, Rich, because I think the federal state, local and education academic is really important. I'll come to that. We have seen also great progress and I mentioned for this Q4 already a good new life sciences deal, great progress in health care and life sciences. Think patient experience. Why should citizen experience be any different?",Leslie Stretch ,4392969
,,,,
16849,Question-and-Answer,"I can tell you from the hard work of our government team and also some of the brilliant government colleagues that we brought into Medallia that every tier of government is passionate about citizen experience and, at the moment, patient experience, and they absolutely want to avail themselves of the very best technology. And so we positioned ourselves through FedRAMP qualification and through the right commercial structures to make it easy for government to acquire cost-effective, up-to-the-minute citizen experience technology versus the old survey stuff that used to be there.",Leslie Stretch ,4392969
,,,,
16850,Question-and-Answer,"And also in the academic market, actually, we only gave a few logos on the call. We actually had more success than that, that we didn't report on the call. We don't want to name the agencies involved. But also in the academic market, we've had a couple of survey players there, frankly, shooting fish in a barrel and frankly, overcharging higher education for simple survey services. And we intend to have a crack at that market. There's absolutely nothing to lose for us going after that, too. And that's part of our investment in sales and marketing around the world as well. It's a good market.",Leslie Stretch ,4392969
,,,,
16851,Question-and-Answer,"So I'm actually enthusiastic about our progress. We have almost nothing in the sector a year ago. And this year, the government team have started to really make great strides forward, both at federal and state and local. And I mentioned a couple of those there. I think it's a big opportunity actually. Great question.",Leslie Stretch ,4392969
,,,,
16852,Question-and-Answer,,Leslie Stretch ,4392969
,,,,
16853,Question-and-Answer,Your next question comes from the line of Brian Schwartz from Oppenheimer & Co.,Operator,4392969
,,,,
16854,Question-and-Answer,"Good job on the quarter here. Leslie, first question for you. It has to do with the investment profile here for next year. It's really a question on the sales and hiring. Are there any particular product areas and/or geographies that you see that there's a big opportunity where it's more of a function that the company just doesn't have enough sales bandwidth today? I realize you got to expand everywhere, so I understand that. But is there anything that stands out to you in that front in terms of either geographies or product lines?",Brian Schwartz,4392969
,,,,
16855,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. Actually, a great question. Actually, both and also verticals. I kind of alluded to some of the new verticals there. We're having great success in health care and life sciences. There's a lot more to do in both of those markets. And also federal, I mentioned.",Leslie Stretch ,4392969
,,,,
16856,Question-and-Answer,"Geographically, the big regions, Latin America actually had a nice recovery in Q3, but the big regions for us are EMEA, which had a great Q3 and also APAC, which is a phenomenal business with great leadership, a great team out there. And so we're investing in all of those. I don't want to go into too much detail for the competitors that's on the call read the transcript and all that obviously. But great opportunities in those regions and frankly, competitive opportunities, too, that we see. We see disruption and dislocation and just people not catching up with the spectrum, the digital spectrum that we've created. So there's a gap that we can exploit. So definitely APAC and EMEA and of course, always all day long, North America.",Leslie Stretch ,4392969
,,,,
16857,Question-and-Answer,"And one for Roxanne, just a quick one on the dollar base in that expansion number. You kind of -- you talked about it in your introductory comments, why it had some pressure here this quarter. But my question is do you feel that this sort of mid-1 teens range is an area that the company would bottom out at? I know there's still a lot of uncertainty out there in the market. I don't want to peg you down too much. But do you feel better that, that metric would normalize here in the quarters ahead?",Brian Schwartz,4392969
,,,,
16858,Question-and-Answer,"So historically, we have been in the mid- to high teens. And we had a great quarter not only from a new logo perspective but also from an expansion perspective. And as I shared on the call, our net retention rate was impacted by some customers who either filed for bankruptcy or merged with another company or were acquired. However, when I look ahead, we've shared before that we think ultimately we should be able to get this net retention rate over 120%.",Roxanne Oulman ,4392969
,,,,
16859,Question-and-Answer,"We have over 1,000 customers at this point. We added, 50% of our bookings came from new logos. So -- and we have a very robust product portfolio with 15 different modules that we can cross sell. And it's not just cross sell. It's the expansion. And you heard Leslie also talk about the Magic Gartner and the other analyst feedback that we've received in regards to the fact that we have the most robust platform with the most individuals on it and is used most broadly throughout the departments of these organizations.",Roxanne Oulman ,4392969
,,,,
16860,Question-and-Answer,"So I'm optimistic about what we can do in the future. I'm optimistic about what I see. We have 1,000 new customers, 1,000 customers that we can continue to cross sell and upsell to while we continue to add new logos.",Roxanne Oulman ,4392969
,,,,
16861,Question-and-Answer,Your next question comes from the line of Bhavan Suri from William Blair.,Operator,4392969
,,,,
16862,Question-and-Answer,"Let me echo congrats, especially on the new logo adds. That was really solid. I want to touch a little bit on the partner systems outside of your bid to acquire a collaboration company. You obviously partnered with Adobe, Salesforce, ServiceNow as well as global SIs. Leslie, this has been part of your plan coming onboard. You added the partnerships. I guess just give us an update on how they're performing according to your expectations, both the software partnerships as well as the delivery partnerships.",Bhavan Suri ,4392969
,,,,
16863,Question-and-Answer,,Bhavan Suri ,4392969
,,,,
16864,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. I'm actually quite pleased. I can see it's pretty early days, but most of these are less than a year in the making and some we just announced new ones too. And so it's very early days for the channel. I'm actually very pleased with what the channel teams have done. And just the appetite with these partners, we were in our second year actually with Adobe now. That's probably the longest one. And also ServiceNow integrations. I see collaboration. There's good collaboration in the field. And some of these large deals, you'll see Salesforce, ServiceNow, Adobe all day long. They're all in there.",Leslie Stretch ,4392969
,,,,
16865,Question-and-Answer,"So having these integrations and partnerships and in some cases, actually, revenue share agreements is a good thing, and it's really bolstered our win rate. There's no doubt about that. I think I attribute the increase in the new bookings percentage to those partnerships. I wouldn't single out any one of them. I don't think that's appropriate, actually, but those are probably the top ones.",Leslie Stretch ,4392969
,,,,
16866,Question-and-Answer,"But we've got some great new partners, market research partner, Ipsos, which is a super partner company as we've done very well with. I'm very pleased with the systems integrators, particularly the work at Accenture and also really Deloitte where we've got some very meaningful traction now.",Leslie Stretch ,4392969
,,,,
16867,Question-and-Answer,"But again, it's early days. So far, so good. And I think we are the only really credible, open enterprise partner in the space. And we don't do anything that any of these companies do, and we don't have any pretentions to do that either. I think that is important as we operate with them in these new deal scenarios that we see.",Leslie Stretch ,4392969
,,,,
16868,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. That actually leads me to my second question, sort of, I guess, a broader question, and you touched on it. So you don't do SFA, sales force automation for example, and you don't do e-commerce. But customer experience touches a lot of things, right? It does encroach a little bit on marketing. It certainly encroaches on communications a little bit. It certainly encroaches on not just the analytic of analyzing what people are doing but then also the action. Like go do this to fix it, like someone just calling a hotel and gets routed through the technology and someone gets to call them. How do you think about that sort of encroaching on the biggest space? Because, obviously, the category itself is pretty nascent, the overall customer experience, and there's lots of people playing in it. So I'd love to understand how you think about the box you set yourself in, which is bigger than where you are today obviously. But how do you sort of define that? That would be great to understand.",Bhavan Suri ,4392969
,,,,
16869,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. That's a great, great question. I think the core for us is really getting to the truth of feedback is creating safe spaces for feedback, doing it digitally, doing it fast in the current environment, understanding that customer journeys have changed. And nobody really does that. Simple surveys don't do that. They're certainly part of the equation, but they're by no means the whole story.",Leslie Stretch ,4392969
,,,,
16870,Question-and-Answer,"It's all of this other signal capture that the customers want. The customers have demanded that. It's a customer-driven road map. But right now and actually for the foreseeable future, there's plenty of room for us. Even with our messaging technology, it's not -- it doesn't -- we use actually Twilio and the underlying transport there. They're a great partner. We don't butt up against any of these. And as you say, we don't do SFA. We don't do any of those things.",Leslie Stretch ,4392969
,,,,
16871,Question-and-Answer,"And actually, in marketing, it's added value. You want to send out marketing campaigns with the benefit of feedback about individual customers. That's a massive scaling computational challenge, right? Identify the individual customer, understand its feedback in this situation in context before you try and send them -- sell them something else through a marketing campaign. Adobe is one of the best at that, and using feedback to move those campaigns is really powerful. So it's a great complement.",Leslie Stretch ,4392969
,,,,
16872,Question-and-Answer,,Leslie Stretch ,4392969
,,,,
16873,Question-and-Answer,"We've got plenty of room for maneuver, as you say, and it's a nascent market. It's really just emerging into the digital feedback market that it really should have been all along. And I think plenty of room to maneuver for the foreseeable future in the next few years.",Leslie Stretch ,4392969
,,,,
16874,Question-and-Answer,Your next question comes from the line of Drew Foster from Citigroup.,Operator,4392969
,,,,
16875,Question-and-Answer,"As you're thinking about whether it's bookings or billings, Q4 is obviously typically a very important quarter for Medallia from a transaction volume perspective. And at the same time, we've seen kind of varying degrees of success across the broader software and tech space with companies such as yourselves who are more exposed to a larger enterprise demographic. So Leslie, kind of, wondering if you could double click on some proof points or customer anecdotes that would help us gauge your confidence level closing out the year.",Drew Foster,4392969
,,,,
16876,Question-and-Answer,"I mean Last quarter and this quarter, you mentioned larger deals and even some mega deals and also cited that experience initiatives are sort of rising priority among CEOs and so forth. So it's evident you're seeing pockets of strength there and large deals are still happening. But just kind of help us gauge potential risk for customers maybe wanting to weigh for slightly better operating environments or just sense of urgency around getting large deals done, especially here in Q4.",Drew Foster,4392969
,,,,
16877,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. Well, I think that's a realistic view of the world and observation. But to that end, we've moved into new markets this year that we were really not in health care and life sciences most notably. And certainly, we've seen our government sector start to deliver. So I'm really excited about that. At the same time, we saw travel and hospitality really more up on for a while and so -- although we've seen some feedback volumes rising in some of those sectors.",Leslie Stretch ,4392969
,,,,
16878,Question-and-Answer,"But we're not dependent now on -- Medallia, a few years ago as a private company was a big deal only sort of story and very successful, too. We are not dependent on that anymore. We have a very broad spectrum and ability to land and expand, ability to show people proof points, do proof of concepts, do all kinds of deals that will get us into more familiar relationships with large enterprises, too, so they're -- they can pull the trigger like some of those customers that we just talked about in Q3.",Leslie Stretch ,4392969
,,,,
16879,Question-and-Answer,"So we've taken all that into account in the way we look at Q4 and FY '22. We've taken all that into account plus the pandemic We've taken a conservative maybe even a pessimistic view of recovery. We don't need that to get to our projection because the company has pivoted beautifully to digital, has pivoted beautifully to virtual working. So that's why I look at Q4.",Leslie Stretch ,4392969
,,,,
16880,Question-and-Answer,"And I appreciate your comment. I get where you're coming from on the other companies and all that. But our story is ours, and I feel we're in control of it. We'd had 3 pandemic quarters now. We understand how to be effective virtually. We'd all like to be together, and we'd all like to collaborate physically and all the rest of it. We actually understand how to do it. It's highly productive. Our customers like it. And so I think we're well positioned.",Leslie Stretch ,4392969
,,,,
16881,Question-and-Answer,"That's really helpful commentary, Leslie. And just a last one for either of you. I mean as we think about some of the verticals who obviously have been impacted this year and we contemplate the guidance that you have out there now for next year, Roxanne, if those verticals start to come back a little bit quicker than we're expecting here, I mean, can you help us kind of contextualize or quantify what potential uplift that could bring you next year?",Leslie Stretch ,4392969
,,,,
16882,Question-and-Answer,"So as I shared, you're right. We're not anticipating that, to hit our numbers that we would need to have a significant recovery in hospitality and travel. I think it's too early to tell you, hey, if they recovered what I think this could do from an upside. However, obviously, there could be some upside to our number if we do that. And it's not just about hospitality and travel though. We have really broadened our overall vertical portfolio. And we've talked about the fact of life sciences and health care.",Roxanne Oulman ,4392969
,,,,
16883,Question-and-Answer,,Roxanne Oulman ,4392969
,,,,
16884,Question-and-Answer,"However, we've seen a lot of activity in manufacturing and high tech, especially as companies are working and bringing their people back to the factories, they need to be able to communicate with them. They're also using our product in communicating with their vendors, getting feedback from their vendors. So those are all different aspects that we hadn't seen before. And Leslie talked to you about a pharmaceutical company that is using our products in part of their vaccine and a -- McDonald's Australia, who's using it for contract tasting. So based on the usage of our product and the breadth of our product throughout these organizations, we're seeing a lot of upside in regards to multiple verticals. So it's not just about hospitality and transport.",Roxanne Oulman ,4392969
,,,,
16885,Question-and-Answer,Your next question comes from the line of Terry Tillman from Truist Securities.,Operator,4392969
,,,,
16886,Question-and-Answer,"I guess I'll spare you a question about the collaboration space. But yes. So I did see the news recently, and we had touched on it in one of our reports, but the new hire on the Chief Digital Officer and demand gen side. I know you're always on the lookout for new talent, but demand gen seems kind of an important area. So maybe, Leslie, you could give us some perspective on kind of what instigated that move. And then I had just a quick follow-up.",Terry Tillman,4392969
,,,,
16887,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. No, super question. Thank you, Terry. Great question. Yes. I mean everything's changed. People that depended on events and classical events, you can't do this. You won't be able to do this for some time. And so if you try and take your traditional classical event and replicate it in the digital world online and create a live event, you create the same time ban temporal constraints to the physical event. Henson is a thinker around digital, and he's an award-winning digital marketer. We're about creating short, sharp, highly impacted sessions.",Leslie Stretch ,4392969
,,,,
16888,Question-and-Answer,"And the last few months, I've actually never done as many customer live sessions that we've been able to record and then put out there on the web for people to see the use cases live and in action. And I think we've only just begun to see the contribution to the pipeline on that activity. And so it's everything for us now. So digital marketing, short, sharp, broadcast, Medallia.tv, all of these things you're going to see coming to the fore. And we want to be best in class at it. And we've certainly got the team -- the marketing team to do that. So that was why we moved there quite aggressively, quite quickly, and I expect to see big things from it. We can already feel the effect on the pipeline, so -- but I'm not saying too much more about that, but that's how we think about it.",Leslie Stretch ,4392969
,,,,
16889,Question-and-Answer,"That's great. And maybe, Roxanne, just a really quick one for you but the concept of $5-or-so million in billings kind of impact this year from ramp deals and the idea of modified subscription terms. I know you're just guiding to subscription and total revenue, which is very helpful for FY '22 by the way. But as you look into next year, and again, I know you're not going to talk about like billings and things like that, and that could be lumpy, but do you -- at a high level, would you expect kind of more of the same next year? Or do you think that some of these dynamics you all had to deal with could start to add?",Terry Tillman,4392969
,,,,
16890,Question-and-Answer,"Well, I think some of the dynamics that we've worked with will ebb because we've seen some of those dynamics ebb. If you look at the concession impact from a revenue perspective, the concession impact has been consistent over the last 2 quarters. So said differently, we haven't made additional concessions that include those impacted customers.",Roxanne Oulman ,4392969
,,,,
16891,Question-and-Answer,"So I think that when you look at our renewals that we've had, and someone asked the question about the renewal with the cruise line, we've also had significant renewals with hospitality or even retail companies that have been impacted. So with that said, I think that the impact that we're seeing this year should start to be much more less -- be much less.",Roxanne Oulman ,4392969
,,,,
16892,Question-and-Answer,,Roxanne Oulman ,4392969
,,,,
16893,Question-and-Answer,Your next question comes from the line of Matt VanVliet from BTIG.,Operator,4392969
,,,,
16894,Question-and-Answer,All right. I guess maybe a follow-up on the public sector. A lot of strength there and seeing some good growth. Just curious on how you're seeing seasonality around that. Is third quarter expected to be kind of the high watermark on a typical annual seasonality? Or do you still see quite a bit of strength here in the next several quarters?,Matt VanVliet ,4392969
,,,,
16895,Question-and-Answer,"Well, I think it's true it's the high watermark from a federal perspective, but we've got state and local that we're just really getting into. But we also have global. We have international. To be fair, in the year, it's probably the first place that we're making good progress in public sector. They have some of the largest public sector employees in the world after all in the UK and in Germany. And so actually, there is a spread there. It's not all about just federal.",Leslie Stretch ,4392969
,,,,
16896,Question-and-Answer,"So I'm pretty happy with that we made a big investment. We built a multiyear plan around federal, state and local, and now we're going to begin our academic work, which is very important. And we're coming from a position where we don't have any baggage at all in that market, and we're starting with a new modern digital perspective, which is very exciting. Indeed, we've had some of our first engagements, in fact, some of our first wins really taking away the very simple stupid survey technologies that are being used in that space. And they are crying out for more than the survey technologies can provide them. So I'm not steep buoyant about public sector across the year and not just the normal fall, as you point out, federal kind of spending phase.",Leslie Stretch ,4392969
,,,,
16897,Question-and-Answer,"That's great. And then I know it's pretty early on the mid-market side, but just curious what deals look like from a total number of modules or how comprehensive some of those are looking. Are they much more of kind of a low land-and-expand deal? Or are you seeing some of those customers really taking down larger portions of the platform even if it's at a slightly smaller TCV?",Matt VanVliet ,4392969
,,,,
16898,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. We actually have. We've seen everything. But we actually have, and I mentioned a couple of them on the call. We got this fabulous homebuilder that really was a long-standing customer of a well-known survey market research vendor. And when they realize they can have fully modern digital spectrum that we can provide, they were all over it. And so I think what's actually surprising about our mid-market success is the number of people that want Medallia Experience Cloud. But we do have great land and expand with some of our acquisitions like LivingLens. Our ideas technology is a great entry point. We can go from ideas to Medallia Experience Cloud.",Leslie Stretch ,4392969
,,,,
16899,Question-and-Answer,"So the point for us is that the growth in our coverage in that area, we're still relatively small in sales terms in terms of others, but we're growing fast. But we have much more to offer salespeople, talented virtual salespeople, much more spectrum to sell and so much more powerful solutions for customers. So -- but it's really interesting to see the number of them, not one but full radar scope of Medallia Experience Cloud. And we actually thought they might start with a simple survey or might start with just Digital or might start with LivingLens video. But we've been pleasantly surprised by the number of people that have come along after the full story. And also the size of some of the deals, we have some good mid-6-figure deals there.",Leslie Stretch ,4392969
,,,,
16900,Question-and-Answer,Your next question comes from Brett Knoblauch from Berenberg Capital Markets.,Operator,4392969
,,,,
16901,Question-and-Answer,"Just one for me. I think on the organic side, customer adds are really strong in the quarter. Is that something you would expect to continue given maybe the increased involvement from partners and mid-market success?",Brett Knoblauch,4392969
,,,,
16902,Question-and-Answer,,Brett Knoblauch,4392969
,,,,
16903,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, it is. I think we -- and we talked about our pivot to really big investment in digital marketing. I think we're just beginning to see the beginnings of that, as I mentioned, in the pipeline. We've added substantially to our mid-market sales team. We have a fabulous academy program that brings people in and onboards them and makes it effective. And we still have our big deal team, which actually is growing. And so I do feel that the opportunity is there for us to do well through Q4 and also through FY '22, absolutely, yes.",Leslie Stretch ,4392969

16904,Question-and-Answer,I will now return the call to Leslie Stretch for closing remarks.,Operator,4392969

16915,Presentation,"Now, Rob Bearden, CEO.",Kevin Cook,4392938
,,,,
16916,Presentation,"Thank you, Kevin. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter fiscal 2021 results. Today we?ll focus on CDP momentum with customers, strategy and the rationale for our planned share repurchases and debt issuance as announced a short time ago in our quarterly results press release.",Rob Bearden,4392938
,,,,
16917,Presentation,"We continued to execute extremely well in Q3. Total revenue in the third quarter was $218 million, subscription revenue was $197 million and non-GAAP operating income was $49 million. Annualized recurring revenue reached $756 million at the conclusion of the quarter, representing 12% year-over-year organic growth.",Rob Bearden,4392938
,,,,
16918,Presentation,"The total number of customers who exceeded $100,000 of ARR was about level at 1,008. The number of customers who generate ARR greater than $1 million grew from 172 last quarter to 179 in Q3. It was an excellent performance in the midst of what remains a difficult operating environment based on the pandemic.",Rob Bearden,4392938
,,,,
16919,Presentation,"It?s especially encouraging that, even while we wait for the CDP product cycle to be reflected in the financials, growth in subscription revenues and ARR has been consistent for several quarters. Also, we delivered another extraordinary result on the bottom line, evidencing significant operating leverage in the business, and Jim will spend more time on operating profitability in a few minutes.",Rob Bearden,4392938
,,,,
16920,Presentation,"Now let?s turn to an update on the Cloudera Data Platform. It may be useful to outline our priorities and expectations for CDP. CDP represents the next generation of data management and advanced analytics as a hybrid multi-cloud platform. It?s the industry?s first enterprise data cloud, driven by the rapid innovation of the open source community and enterprise data cloud supports both public and private cloud implementations across the complete data lifecycle in a secure environment. That means CDP can solve real business problems for a wide variety of use cases ranging from data collection to reporting and artificial intelligence.",Rob Bearden,4392938
,,,,
16921,Presentation,"CDP has two form factors; public cloud and private cloud. By taking advantage of both CDP public and private, along with our shared data experience capabilities, our customers are able to optimize the performance, cost and security of every business application. In other words, they get the best of both worlds; the speed and agility of the public cloud and the security and performance of the private cloud, all managed from a common console. It?s the interoperability of CDP public and private that delivers the true hybrid cloud functionality our enterprise customers are demanding.",Rob Bearden,4392938
,,,,
16922,Presentation,"As you know, we began our hybrid cloud journey with CDP public cloud just over a year ago. Since that time, we?ve been hard at work delivering a series of discrete public cloud services including cloud-native data warehousing and machine learning capabilities. And more recently, we delivered CDP private cloud in August of this year.",Rob Bearden,4392938
,,,,
16923,Presentation,"As a cornerstone of our hybrid product strategy, CDP private cloud enables our customers to run their analytic functions on-premise or in a data center with the same user experience as CDP public cloud and a shared security and governance framework with SDX. This empowers CDP private customers to achieve public-cloud-like ease of use, scalability and agility. CDP?s separation of compute and storage and use of Kubernetes container technology means that the user experience is nearly identical in public and private Cloud.",Rob Bearden,4392938
,,,,
16924,Presentation,"Most importantly, the combination of CDP private cloud and CDP public cloud provides our customers with the flexibility to run their workloads in the safest and most cost effective environment for their unique needs. This interoperability between CDP public and private makes the total cost of ownership for most use cases significantly lower for customers when compared to public cloud only offerings. And this is one of the many reasons our customers are so excited about our enterprise data cloud solutions.",Rob Bearden,4392938
,,,,
16925,Presentation,,Rob Bearden,4392938
,,,,
16926,Presentation,"With CDP private cloud now available and our hybrid cloud vision nearing completion, we?re beginning to see an acceleration of migrations from our legacy products to CDP. In fact, we?ve already seen more than 150 customers make the move to CDP private.",Rob Bearden,4392938
,,,,
16927,Presentation,"When you combine that with our growing CDP public cloud adoption, we can now comfortably state that more than 10% of our customer base has begun their move to CDP. It?s also noteworthy that more than 50% of our $1 million plus customers have initiated their migration to CDP, demonstrating their commitment to Cloudera. Migrating existing customers to CDP is now the primary objective of our sales teams and we?ve set aggressive migration targets for Q4 and beyond.",Rob Bearden,4392938
,,,,
16928,Presentation,"In terms of CDP public cloud, we?ve maintained a rapid rate of innovation on the platform. In September, we announced three exciting new and upcoming public cloud services, which are CDP data engineering, CDP operational database and CDP data visualization. These new services are designed specifically for data specialists; helping data engineers, data analysts, and data scientists work smarter and faster. The data lifecycle integration is what enables these specialists to work on the same data securely and efficiently, no matter where that data may reside or where the analytics run.",Rob Bearden,4392938
,,,,
16929,Presentation,"CDP data engineering is a powerful Apache Spark service on Kubernetes and includes key productivity enhancing capabilities. CDP operational database is a high-performance NoSQL database service that provides unparalleled scale and performance for business critical operational applications. And lastly, CDP data visualization simplifies the curation of rich, visual dashboards, reports and charts, democratizing access to data and analytics across organizations at scale.",Rob Bearden,4392938
,,,,
16930,Presentation,"These new services complement the existing public cloud offerings, which are CDP data hub, CDP data warehouse and CDP machine learning. We now have a compelling set of cloud-native services that support multiple analytic functions. This breadth means an expanding opportunity for CDP as it becomes increasingly useful to data scientists, data engineers, data analysts, application developers and data managers. And we?ll continue to introduce new public cloud services with the full data lifecycle in mind.",Rob Bearden,4392938
,,,,
16931,Presentation,"As mentioned previously, CDP public cloud adoption is going well. In fact, the number of paying public cloud customers increased by more than 40% since we last reported. Consumption revenue also grew nicely quarter-over-quarter but remains relatively small. In general, customers who are renewing today are doing so on the basis of the CDP roadmap with plans to take advantage of our hybrid platform, leveraging both CDP public and private Cloud. Typically, customers are migrating existing workloads to CDP private cloud and adopting CDP public cloud to build new applications and service new use cases. But regardless of how customers are getting started, one thing seems to be consistently true. Hybrid and multi-cloud is the strategy our customers are deploying.",Rob Bearden,4392938
,,,,
16932,Presentation,"For more context, the majority of customers using CDP public cloud have gotten started with CDP data hub service. This is the fastest path for our customers to get their existing workloads to CDP public cloud and then expand their usage from there. Customers utilizing CDP data hub include a number of global organizations such as Experian, PT iForte from Indonesia, and Zelenza from Spain.",Rob Bearden,4392938
,,,,
16933,Presentation,"As our customers gain experience with CDP data hub, they tend to use more specialized services like machine learning. CDP machine learning offers purpose-built tools and functions specifically designed for data scientists and ML engineers. This service provides simple, powerful ML workspaces with secure, self-service access to enterprise data. Examples of customers using CDP machine learning include Globe Telecom, APG, which is a pension provider in the Netherlands, and Serasa S.A., which is a credit services provider in Brazil.",Rob Bearden,4392938
,,,,
16934,Presentation,,Rob Bearden,4392938
,,,,
16935,Presentation,"One of the other primary use cases for CDP public cloud is the data warehousing service. Like the machine learning service, it?s best for new use cases and new workloads. Using containerization technology to abstract SQL queries from the data analyst, CDP data warehouse provides easy access to virtual warehouses that support complex reports and enterprise dashboards, as well as data marts for interactive, ad-hoc analysis. The service also offers auto-scaling, auto-suspend and auto-resume functions to optimize performance and cost. Examples of customers utilizing CDP data warehouse include IQVIA, which is a large life sciences provider, and Teranet, which is an eRegistry provider headquartered in Canada.",Rob Bearden,4392938
,,,,
16936,Presentation,"To be clear, these customers and most CDP public cloud customers use more than one CDP service. They can start with any CDP service and easily add new ones. This is the strategy reflecting the typical data lifecycle. Customers are using multiple CDP services to deliver complex business use cases like fraud prevention, customer churn reduction, and Customer 360. What?s more, the recent release of CDP private cloud is enabling innovative customers like Globe and IQVIA to implement these types of use cases across the hybrid cloud. This is consistent with our enterprise data cloud strategy and reflects the differentiation and customer value in CDP.",Rob Bearden,4392938
,,,,
16937,Presentation,"Now, let?s shift to some other strategic updates. We made an important acquisition in Q3. We acquired Eventador, a streaming analytics company, based in Austin, Texas. Eventador is the leader in SQL streaming, enabling SQL queries to be performed on data streams. This highly differentiated technology empowers developers, data scientists, and analysts to self-serve streaming data and easily build real-time data pipelines, models, dashboards and applications.",Rob Bearden,4392938
,,,,
16938,Presentation,"Eventador brings category leadership, mindshare and essential intellectual property to our Cloudera data flow and streaming services. It will also allow us to offer containerized services for Kafka, NiFi, and Flink, which would result in the most complete solution-set in this fast growing market. We believe the ability to offer all three streaming technologies is a significant competitive advantage.",Rob Bearden,4392938
,,,,
16939,Presentation,"As exemplified by the Eventador acquisition, we are increasingly focused on delivering solutions in the high-growth segments of the data management and analytics market, both as standalone offerings and as part of our platform. Data streaming and real-time analytics on streaming data is one of those segments.",Rob Bearden,4392938
,,,,
16940,Presentation,"In fact, the IDC Worldwide Big Data and Analytics Software report forecasts that the continuous analytics software market, which includes data streaming, will grow from $2.1 billion in 2021 to $4.4 billion in 2024, implying a 20% compound annual growth rate. Given this growth outlook, you can expect us to put more resources into the data streaming and real-time analytics sector.",Rob Bearden,4392938
,,,,
16941,Presentation,"Similarly, I want to highlight our performance in machine learning and AI. Along with streaming, our machine learning and AI business is one of our fastest growing segments. This is partially a result of having invested early in understanding the data scientist persona and supporting their workflows as distinct from that of data engineers and developers.",Rob Bearden,4392938
,,,,
16942,Presentation,"In Q3, our CDP machine learning service was recognized as a leader by Forrester Wave for Notebook-Based Predictive Analytics and Machine Learning. This is a very satisfying result after many years of development in this space. Like streaming, you can expect us to continue to put significant resources behind the machine learning and AI opportunity.",Rob Bearden,4392938
,,,,
16943,Presentation,"Well, as I hope you?ve heard, we made a great deal of demonstrable progress in Q3. So now, let?s have Jim take us through the financial results. Jim?",Rob Bearden,4392938
,,,,
16944,Presentation,,Rob Bearden,4392938
,,,,
16945,Presentation,"Thanks, Rob. Hello, everyone. Q3 was another very good quarter for Cloudera, reflecting stability in the business and consistently strong execution on all measures. Total revenue was $218 million, an increase of 10% year-over-year. Subscription revenue was $197 million, an increase of 18% year-over-year. Annualized recurring revenue for fiscal year Q3 was $756 million, up 12% over last year.",Jim Frankola,4392938
,,,,
16946,Presentation,"Note, information regarding definitions and trends can be found in today?s press release or the supplemental materials on Cloudera?s Investor Relations Web site.

,,,,
16947,Presentation,"We expanded customers representing greater than $1 million of ARR to 179 from 172 last quarter, which represents a 23% increase year-over-year. Also, gains in Q3 were similar to Q2 with respect to non-paying users of the software becoming subscription customers.",Jim Frankola,4392938
,,,,
16948,Presentation,"The third quarter was marked by record profitability for the company. Greater operating profit is a reflection of a core merger thesis as well as outstanding execution and sustained revenue growth. In addition, like many other companies, we have seen short-term financial benefits and costs associated with the pandemic. In Q3, our operating margin came in at roughly 6 percentage points higher than normalized levels due to lower travel, field marketing and facilities costs.",Jim Frankola,4392938
,,,,
16949,Presentation,"As I review the remainder of the income statement, note that unless otherwise stated, all references to expenses and operating results are on a non-GAAP basis.

16950,Presentation,"Total gross margin for Q3 was 85% compared to 77% in Q3 of last year driven by subscription gross margin of 91%, up from 86% in the year-ago period. Total operating expenses were $135 million for the third quarter, continuing a post-merger trend toward a lower expense structure.",Jim Frankola,4392938
,,,,
16951,Presentation,"These operating expenses were 62% of total revenue in Q3 of fiscal 2021 as compared to 81% of total revenue in Q3 of last year. Overall, operating income was $49 million for the third quarter, representing an operating margin of 23%, a substantial improvement of 27 percentage points compared to Q3 of last year.",Jim Frankola,4392938
,,,,
16952,Presentation,"Operating cash flow for the third quarter was $18 million, bringing year-to-date operating cash flow to $119 million.

,,,,
16963,Presentation,"Thanks, Jim. As you can tell from the financials and our outlook, the business is doing well. We?ve exceeded all internal and external expectations for several quarters now. We?ve executed on the merger rationale with Hortonworks, achieving substantial operating income margins and increasing cash flow through strong management, operational efficiency gains and cost discipline.",Rob Bearden,4392938

16970,Question-and-Answer,[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Chad Bennett with Craig-Hallum. Your line is open.,Operator,4392938
,,,,
16971,Question-and-Answer,"Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Nice job on the quarter. And the guide looks great. So just a couple of things. Now that we're seeing pretty material migrations to the private cloud, Rob, what ? kind of what are the expectations as we look out? And I know it's still early, but we look out 6 to 12 months with the existing customers that are migrating. What's the potential for expansion just on the private cloud side from a use case standpoint? Can you elaborate on that?",Chad Bennett,4392938
,,,,
16972,Question-and-Answer,,Chad Bennett,4392938
,,,,
16973,Question-and-Answer,"Hi, Chad. Thanks for joining us. So we're going through and quite frankly find the pattern recognition on what that looks like. The good news is, we now have the public and private out in the market and that's very helpful, because that now lets our customers define and establish what their data architecture looks like, what the migration of workloads are going to be, what the order and sequencing are going to be, what's going to be on private, what's going to be on public. The typical pattern that we're seeing right now is biggest majority of the existing workloads go to private and then they will, in many cases, expand and add incremental workloads; some of those will be private, some of those will be public, and then will tend to be stored on public and then leveraged on-prem data sets for better views, more holistic views of data.",Rob Bearden,4392938
,,,,
16974,Question-and-Answer,"Perfect. And then maybe one quick follow up for Jim. Just in terms of ? obviously interesting times right now still in the pandemic, but just in terms of how you're thinking about seasonality of bookings in the current quarter, relative to prior years? And maybe a follow up if I can on that for either one of you, just kind of your level of or IBM's level of interest in activity that you expect in this quarter, especially around the private cloud product? Thanks.",Chad Bennett,4392938
,,,,
16975,Question-and-Answer,"So I'll start with the seasonality piece and then I'll turn it to Rob to talk about IBM?s interest. So, typically we do around 35% to 40% of our bookings in Q4. So we're a seasonal business like most enterprise software. This Q4, it's a tough question to model. So we initially anticipated back when the pandemic started that the life [ph] would potentially start resuming normalcy in Q4, that's clearly not the case. And we're looking at obviously a second wave of virus impact. So we've modeled the Q4, it looks a lot like Q3 and Q2 in terms of customer demand. Seasonality, that might mean that that is on the lower end of that 35% to 40% range, but it's tough to call right now.",Jim Frankola,4392938
,,,,
16976,Question-and-Answer,"I?ll pick up the question then on IBM. Very similar story actually with our just core customer base. As you know, we got a number of joint customers with IBM. It's been a great relationship, great partnership. Go to market continues to strengthen. And those customers tend to be the high end enterprises that have very, very strong interest in leading the biggest portion of workloads right now to CDP private. It's a really big value proposition, not only in terms of just being able to separate storage, compute, the value that brings, but just the ease of use, the ease of admin and the value creation that OpenShift brings to the CDP product platform. And on a holistic basis where we have over 150 customers that are in motion right now to CDP and many, many more than that that are in the detailed planning phase, how that splits between our independent customers and joint customers with IBM and other partners, I honestly can't tell you. But the big migrations to CDP private are really happening and that starts to also now open up and enable adoption to CDP public as well. So hopefully that captured your question.",Rob Bearden,4392938
,,,,
16977,Question-and-Answer,It does. Thanks much. Nice job.,Chad Bennett,4392938
,,,,
16978,Question-and-Answer,"Thanks, Chad.",Rob Bearden,4392938
,,,,
16979,Question-and-Answer,Your next question is from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Your line is open.,Operator,4392938
,,,,
16980,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. Thank you very much and I will add my congrats. Jim, I'm curious which metric you think we should index to as a best indication of Cloudera?s growth in Q3? I'm looking across ARR growth of 12%, the CRPO growth I think you said was 14%, subscription revenue growth of 18%? Which one do you think is best representing it? And then do you have any thoughts on how to model the ARR growth, specifically in Q4, which probably kind of ties in with what you were talking about a moment ago?",Mark Murphy,4392938
,,,,
16981,Question-and-Answer,,Mark Murphy,4392938
,,,,
16982,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. So for sure, ARR is the single best metric to look at our top line growth. Once again, it's a representation of the economic value of customers at the last day of the quarter. It normalizes for the effects of the merger accounting changes, the shift to 100% open source software. CRPO is pretty close, but there are some artifacts in RPO. For example, you have customers that may have cancellation provisions in their contract that get excluded from RPO, but are still valued in ARR and we get the economic value. So I?d always point you to ARR. And by the way, if you look at ARR over the past four quarters as compared to CRPO over the past four quarters, the average is essentially the exact same number. So ARR is by far the best metric. Going back to how to model ARR, from our perspective, since ARR is a surrogate for bookings, that's one reason why it's a great number. It captures almost all the economic activity that occurs in the quarter and therefore it's hard to offer the same level of prediction as you would for some of the other numbers. What I?ll say is ARR should trend very similar to software revenue trends over time, and I'll leave it at that.",Jim Frankola,4392938
,,,,
16983,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. And then I had a quick follow up in terms of the consumption revenue we're layering into the model for CDP public. Rob, I know you said it's a small amount, but just curious how materially you think that could become if we?re looking at that a few years down the road?",Mark Murphy,4392938
,,,,
16984,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, let me turn that to Jim.",Rob Bearden,4392938
,,,,
16985,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. So in the very long run, we look at some of the same models that you probably look at as well that says a portion of our customers workloads will be running on prem, fortunately running in the private cloud and fortunately public in the public cloud. The public cloud portion will probably be a third to maybe 50% over time. The consumption piece is difficult to estimate at this time in terms of exactly how fast we're going to get there. But we do believe that the public cloud will be a significant portion of our business and the primary way that we're going to be pricing there is on consumption.",Jim Frankola,4392938
,,,,
16986,Question-and-Answer,Great. Thank you very much.,Mark Murphy,4392938
,,,,
16987,Question-and-Answer,Our next question is from Tyler Radke with Citi. Your line is open.,Operator,4392938
,,,,
16988,Question-and-Answer,"Thanks and good afternoon. I wanted to follow up on your comments on some of the customer momentum you're seeing with CDP private. I think you talked about 10% of the overall customer base starting to move and 50% of $1 million plus. Can you just give us a sense for how far through the migration those customers are? When do you think they will be completely migrated? And what kind of financial impact, uplift, up-sells have you seen thus far?",Tyler Radke,4392938
,,,,
16989,Question-and-Answer,"Okay, sure. Thanks for joining the call today. I appreciate it. So, as you can imagine, there are varying states of where they are in their migration. Just from a grounding standpoint, our customers, especially the big enterprises, $1 million plus customers, they're truly running major portions of their business in mission critical workloads, high value creation applications, big data sets typically that they grow and expand fairly aggressively. So there has to be a very methodical process for moving them to the new environment, whether it's public or private. And so we've been engaged with all the customers in varying degrees of capacity to make sure that there's a very clean migration plan that they could go through, and the goal is to make it really look and feel like an upgrade. But again, that depends on which release of Cloudera-Hortonworks legacy they're running and various things. But the goal is to be able to make that move as an upgrade. But even as an upgrade, they will still have to go through a dev/test process, make sure that all the security processes are clean, all the queries run correctly, all the data moves over. And they tend to do it in phases. So with that as the backdrop, I think we'll see of the 150, probably 20%, 25% of those have more than 50% of their existing legacy environment in production in first quarter next year, and then an acceleration of the balance of the customer base in the second and third quarter. And also beyond that first 10% that we have moving right now, that will accelerate because there's a number of others that are in the planning phase, they've just not started the actual migration. And we'll be able to bring more tooling forward over the next 90, 120 days that will also ease those migrations and help move those migrations forward a little faster. I hope that answered your question.",Rob Bearden,4392938
,,,,
16990,Question-and-Answer,,Rob Bearden,4392938
,,,,
16991,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. Thanks, Rob. I appreciate the detail. I guess to clarify one thing, and then I have a follow up. When you say you want to treat these migrations as an upgrade, is that ? does that mean an upgrade in terms of financial impact in terms of higher revenue, or is it just you're trying to obviously pitch that you have a much stronger product and theoretically, the customer is more willing to expand if there's more features. So I just wanted to clarify if that was meant as a financial comment.",Tyler Radke,4392938
,,,,
16992,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. No, I'm sorry. It was really more of a technical reference, if you will, of upgrading from one release to the next. That was really the context I meant from an upgrade standpoint. Of course, it represents opportunity because there's pretty strong value creation of moving from the legacy to CDP private or public. They also tend to want to expand and consume more experiences, whether that's the entire full lifecycle of data management or if it's just one experience whether that be streaming or machine learning, AI or our data engineering, data warehousing solutions. So it represents an opportunity not only to as we move into CDP, they can expand the amount of data under management but also then there's a tremendous amount of value creation of bringing and consuming and leveraging more the lifecycle experiences on top of that, and it's great value exchange and obviously represents more monetization for us.",Rob Bearden,4392938
,,,,
16993,Question-and-Answer,"Got it. And if I could just sneak in one more kind of a higher level question, but I don't know if Jim or Rob or Arun wants to take it. But obviously you've seen your expenses come down a lot. Part of that is driven by lower T&E because of COVID. I think headcount has been kind of trending down as well. It sounds like you're really going after a lot of different markets where there's a lot of competition, whether it's data warehousing, now getting into streaming SQL where you have obviously a large kind of player in that space. You're going up against folks in data science. And I guess how are you thinking about just balancing, investing in those very lucrative but highly competitive markets with the need to kind of continue to show leverage in the financial model? And I guess how should we think about your headcount hedges? Do you think you have enough folks to kind of make the investments and build the products in those markets today? Thanks.",Tyler Radke,4392938
,,,,
16994,Question-and-Answer,"A lot wrapped in that question, so let me do my best to make sure I hit it correctly and inclusively. So what we've done is made a very concerted effort to be efficient in our headcount and we've moved a lot of headcount offshore from the dev and support standpoint, but also from the back office standpoint in the lower cost geo regions. And we've been very successful in that model. And so that allows us to bring very, very highly skilled resources that are cost efficiencies. And we were able to concentrate those skill sets in particular areas that suit our category very nicely. So from a personnel financial model leverage, we?re seeing the benefit of that leverage being picked up in the OpEx line. On the markets that we serve, recognize that what we're very focused on is enabling the enterprise data cloud capability. And so that means being able to provide a hybrid multi-cloud data platform that manages the entire lifecycle of data. So bringing that data under management from point of origination through the stream, be able to take it through an engineering process so then it's stored in either an operational store or a traditional data warehouse and do that across a hybrid multi-cloud platform leveraging a single pane of glass to manage one framework for security, governance, managing metadata, and all the lineage that comes with that. And so while that does cross many of the point solution departmental level areas, we believe we're the most competitive and really only true enterprise data cloud provider that enables that full lifecycle of data across a hybrid multi-cloud platform with one framework for security and governance. And that's really what our enterprises that we serve in the Global 2000 demand. It's not ? they're more interested in having a holistic data architecture strategy that encompasses hybrid and multi-cloud and can manage that end-to-end data lifecycle. And that's what we're bringing forward with CDP. And the reception we're getting from our customer base is great. And as we're introducing that to new customers and prospects, we're getting really, really strong reception.",Rob Bearden,4392938
,,,,
16995,Question-and-Answer,,Rob Bearden,4392938
,,,,
16996,Question-and-Answer,"And let me just jump in on some of the financial elements. So one of the things that we're certainly trying to signal with this quarter is the almost unprecedented improvement in operating margins that you've seen in Cloudera over the past two years, or even the past year, won't continue for the foreseeable future. So we've reached our interim target of profitability. And from a business standpoint, CDP is at a level where we can start investing for growth. And as you're well aware, things move slowly in terms of the investment cycle to the bookings cycle in the subscription software industry. You have to invest early in sales and products. Then you have to sell it and then eventually it shows up in revenue. So going back to one of your questions on the financial model, our profitability is pretty much where we think it should be for right now. And we're looking to invest in the success of CDP. Therefore, as we continue to get operational efficiencies in the business, we?ll reinvest them on a go-forward basis.",Jim Frankola,4392938
,,,,
16997,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. And this is Arun, Tyler. Just to add on to the [indiscernible] question. The fundamental advantage we have or the competitive edge we have is the integration within the process. We feel like that integration, especially with the security and downplays [ph] and the fact that you can do streaming with engineering or single machine learning, these four or five markets we don't think of ourselves as having to go like head-to-head with every single feature or function out there on a standalone basis. Our sort of advantage on the competitive ? overall, we represent a better value proposition by purely the virtue of integration. In some ways, you can think of it as sort of why Microsoft Teams is doing well compared to a standalone product. The integration itself is the value proposition, especially for the customer base we go after which is the high end of the enterprise.",Arun Murthy,4392938

16998,Question-and-Answer,"Thanks again for all the color, guys.",Tyler Radke,4392938

16999,Question-and-Answer,Our next question is from Jack Andrews with Needham. Your line is open.,Operator,4392938
,,,,
17000,Question-and-Answer,"Hi. Good afternoon. It?s Khanh in for Jack. Thanks for taking my questions. Rob, you talked about how customers can easily switch between and consume your discrete cloud services. How do you envision the long-term profile of discrete services should look like within your 100,000 customers? And how should we be thinking about the up-sell impact as customers consume cloud services?",Khanh Ngo,4392938
,,,,
17001,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. Hi. How are you doing? Thanks for joining. So yes, it really goes back to a comment we just made. Those customers are going to consume those services. Many of those want to be able to consume multiple services. In fact, most of our customers are not just consuming one, but they're consuming multiple of the services. They want to provide streaming with ML and streaming with ML all the way down through our data engineering solutions. And so what the real goal is, is to make it easy for them to get started, bring the data under management and then let them be able to turn each of those services on continuously. And the reason that's so cost effective ? excuse me, not cost effective, so efficient for them is the integration that Arun is talking about. They don't have to bring and stitch together multiple point solutions. They can just continue to turn those individual services on as a continuous flow and then be assured that it has a common security and governance framework that goes through the entire lifecycle data. And so that just opens up a number of different use cases that they can apply and make sure that they do it consistently and repeatedly across the enterprise.",Rob Bearden,4392938

17002,Question-and-Answer,"Great. Thank you. That makes sense. And in the past you've talked about how your sales team?s focus in FY '21 will be to migrate customers to CDP. Can you talk about the calories that it takes to migrate your customers from your sales team and how should we be thinking about [indiscernible] FY '22 as more of your sales team gets unlocked, given that migrations are going well?",Khanh Ngo,4392938
,,,,
17003,Question-and-Answer,,Khanh Ngo,4392938
,,,,
17004,Question-and-Answer,"Okay, great. So the goal ? this is one of the things just touching on the earlier question, one of the things that we're really focused on is making those migrations as straightforward as possible. And that's going to come in downstream tools that we're going to be delivering. We're very focused on providing tooling that's going to help those migrations move forward. The goal was to make it feel like an upgrade from a release to a release. Now that has a lot of variable factors to it, depending on what release they?re running in some of their environmental conditions. But we're aggressively focused on how we get that customer base to move over. We're also very focused on ease of use of the platform so that a lot of the functions that may have required professional services can actually be done on a self-service basis. We're very, very focused on that, the digital transformation that Mick?s been leading and we're getting a lot of good success there and seeing good progress and uptake with the customers and things they're able to do in their migrations now to CDP, both private and public. So hopefully that answers your question.",Rob Bearden,4392938

17006,Question-and-Answer,Our next question is from Zane Chrane with Bernstein Research. Your line is open.,Operator,4392938
,,,,
17007,Question-and-Answer,"Hi, gentlemen. Congrats on a great quarter. A question for Arun. If I look at the TCO, you?ve commented on how you have TCO advantage or lower TCO with CDP public and private than the alternatives? How do you ? can you help me understand how you have a lower total cost ownership versus some of the mega scale cloud vendors that have such a large scale advantage and can bundle in the infrastructure? And then secondly, if you could help me kind of quantify what does the actual TCO difference look like in dollar percentage terms both in a private cloud and public cloud versus alternatives? Thank you.",Zane Chrane,4392938
,,,,
17008,Question-and-Answer,"Great questions and thanks for joining. So a few ways to look at this, right. We've got products coming to this in the past, we see this every day. Then we have this conversation with customers. If you look at kind of cloud providers, right, typically what we see, much like whether you go to a single cloud provider and buy a bunch of services, right, you have to buy a monitoring service, a warehouse service, an engineering service, and security service, and so on. Here you see all of this kind of comes bundled in, right. So what happens is, if you look at the overall package, it's a fully integrated platform. And the even better part is that it's available on every cloud you might want to care [ph] and now typically an enterprise will care about one, maybe two, but also a lot of our existing customers have massive footprint. So the fact that if you can think of it in terms of not just the product costs, but also the people and the skills that you need to manage this infrastructure and security and governance and their functionality, the fact that you can do this in one go versus buying either two different vendors and integrating them yourself and paying integration tags, or having to buy from one cloud provider but then buy different services at different price points. And the fact that they're all bundled into CDP provides a massive sort of lift in the CDP. Then, what we also see is typically they go head to head against one of the, let's say, the [indiscernible] out there. Remember that we had a couple of years of investment now, which are highly differentiated, whether it's our security pieces or performance basis. So, not very commonly now when you go head to head against one of the services, one of the open source loop services there [indiscernible] purely from just the performance standpoint will come out anywhere from 2x to 8x faster based on individual workloads. Now that when you combine ? when you think of that and that compounds with the infrastructure cost, the overall TCO from people scale and just pure software look really attractive proposition, especially for the customers we serve today. And that's what keeps us all super excited.",Ar1,4392938

17009,Question-and-Answer,,Ar1,4392938
,,,,
17010,Question-and-Answer,"Very helpful context, I appreciate that. Just a quick follow up. Now that you're shifting to usage-based pricing, it seems like the volume of data growth in existing enterprise customer workloads, just that sheer data volume increasing kind of exponentially alone should be a pretty notable tailwind to your revenue growth. Just wondering if you have a sense of kind of across your entire install base of customers, what the average growth rate is of data across those workloads?",Zane Chrane,4392938
,,,,
17011,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. So your specific question is average rate of data? In the world, it?s growing at 50% to 100% a year. Within our customer base, I don't know the exact rate. It?s probably at that or maybe slightly less. In terms of the ability to monetize it, we are shifting to usage-based pricing. We're shifting to consumption-based pricing for processing, which in some respects is as important if not more important in the long run. And by consumption-based, I mean pricing per core versus per node that allows us to share the benefit of Moore's Law with the customers. With all that said, we're still at the very early stages. So I would expect it in the long run to have a ? be a modest tailwind in terms of opportunity, a few percentage points every year for many years in a row. But we're just started getting started.",Rob Bearden,4392938

17014,Question-and-Answer,Our next question is from Pree Gadey with Barclays. Your line is open.,Operator,4392938
,,,,
17015,Question-and-Answer,"Hi there. I want to ask you on the subscription revenue guide. For 3Q, you guided to a sequential decline. And I know it was a conservative guide. But this quarter, your midpoint of the guide implies about a 2% sequential increase. So I'm wondering if you guys are seeing something in the pipeline that you're a little bit more excited about. How is the demand environment this quarter versus last quarter?",Pree Gadey,4392938
,,,,
17016,Question-and-Answer,"I'll start and Rob can chime in if he wants to. So, the overall demand environment is very similar in Q4 as it was in Q3. So we're still in the middle of the pandemic. It's still a headwind, although we believe we're more resilient than most against that headwind. Regarding the sequential ups and downs, that goes to the seasonal nature of our business. So Q4 is our biggest quarter of the year. Therefore, we tend to see a sequential increase in revenue and ARR heading into Q4, Q3 to Q4 and then into Q1 as well, Q4 to Q1. So it's the seasonality that?s driving the sequential changes more than anything else.",Jim Frankola,4392938
,,,,
17017,Question-and-Answer,"Got it. On CDP private cloud, from some of your early customers I was hoping if you could share kind of expansion rates that you're seeing from those initial customers? And just as a follow up to that as well, can you give us an idea of what type of time commitment and cost commitment it takes for customers to roll over to the new CDP private cloud?",Pree Gadey,4392938
,,,,
17018,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. So appreciate you joining the call as well today. So, again, it goes back to we are ? we want this to, as much as possible, feel like an upgrade from release to release for our customers when they go from either the legacy Cloudera-Hortonworks platform to CDP that has a lot of different factors and in some cases, it's more complex. In some cases, it's even more straightforward. And so time and cost will vary depending on where they are in their existing legacy platform, which release and ? but what we've done is we?ve focused on making sure that we have dedicated teams that will help them through both the planning process and the implementation process so that we make sure we have very, very clean blueprints for them. And as time goes by, we're going to give them more and more tooling that will actually help them through that process and very thorough migration guides that will help them implement those blueprints and move through it. So time and cost vary, but our goal is to help them get there very cleanly and as quickly as possible. So does that hit the question you were looking for?",Rob Bearden,4392938
,,,,
17019,Question-and-Answer,,Rob Bearden,4392938
,,,,
17020,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, thank you. And I guess the expansion rates that you're seeing from some of your earlier CDP private cloud customers that are a little bit more mature.",Pree Gadey,4392938
,,,,
17021,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. So on the expansion rate, it's both expansion on private and that's got a couple of dimensions to it. And what it really does is it opens up to the public. And so on the private, obviously, after they move from the legacy environments to CDP private, they can expand not only incremental data under management, but they can begin to apply more and more use cases to that environment, because recognize it's a much easier environment to operate, it's much easier to scale, because what we've done with separation of storage and compute and all the other things in value that brings from a scale up and down standpoint, the efficiencies of hardware usage that that clearly brings. So it makes it much easier to bring more use cases on, more data under management in a much more cost effective way than running in the traditional on-prem legacy environments. What it also does is it gives them the ability to very cleanly embrace that management of the entire lifecycle of data, leveraging, streaming and machine learning through the data engineering and ultimately into the warehousing capabilities, all leverage. And then what that does then is open up the public cloud for expansion use cases and being able to bring several kinds of workloads up and down quickly and to be able to achieve quick scale out, and CDP is very, very well suited for that. And it begins then to [indiscernible] the public tier expansion much faster than just organically. So that's the pattern that we're now seeing.",Rob Bearden,4392938
,,,,
17022,Question-and-Answer,"And let me just add. If you're looking for a quantification of that expansion rate, I'll repeat what Rob said earlier. We're too soon in the cycle to get that pattern recognition. CDP private cloud communities came out in August. Our customer set, as we've told you, the majority of them are in heavily regulated industries, which has made them very resilient. It also makes them very careful as they adopt new technologies. So many of our customers are evaluating the software, putting it through security, having it running on a single set of servers right now. So it will take us a little bit of time before we have enough data to really be able to quantify the answer to that question.",Jim Frankola,4392938

17025,Question-and-Answer,Our next question is from Sanjit Singh with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.,Operator,4392938
,,,,
17026,Question-and-Answer,"Hi. This is Mark Rende on for Sanjit Singh. Thanks for taking our question. In terms of marketing CDP, going to market with it, are you targeting certain use cases or kind of specific solution sales, whether it be IoT or data warehousing or selling CDP as a kind of general data management platform? Color on that would be really helpful. Thanks.",Mark Rende,4392938
,,,,
17027,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, sure. Hi, Mark. Thanks for joining. We have a very broad set of use cases that get applied onto the platform. Clearly CDP is designed and architected to enable the hybrid multi-cloud data management platform capability, but then the use cases that get leveraged across it probably 50% of the time are data engineering and machine learning. The balance then is heavily weighted towards streaming and data warehousing. We've seen great adoption in the life science and healthcare verticals. Predictive Analytics, leveraging from an IoT standpoint tend to be areas that we're seeing great traction in. As we?ve talked about in the prepared remarks, we?re getting great traction from real-time streaming analytics that's playing across multiple verticals. Oil and gas actually is one of those that's really coming on strong. Healthcare is another vertical where those use cases are becoming more widespread. And what we're learning now is we?ve introduced CDP in the value proposition and customers really understand how quickly they can get up to speed, the ease of use and flexibility that brings the new kinds of use cases they can begin to apply. So we're continuing to learn as well.",Rob Bearden,4392938

,,,,
17029,Question-and-Answer,"Rob, it?s Mick. I?ll jump in a little bit there as well. So you hit it on the head. The primary motion is around the enterprise data cloud, hitting the whole lifecycle with hybrid multi-cloud offerings, Mark. And the one other area I would add is that our marketing is very targeted at specific accounts and specific verticals. So we do a great deal of account-based marketing where we get very close to the customer to understand their specific use cases, and then deliver those up not just in what we offer the customer the product and services, but even the way that we market to them in a very specific way. So hopefully, that?s a little added color.",Mick Hollison,4392938

17031,Question-and-Answer,Our next question is from Nehal Chokshi with Northland Capital Markets. Your line is open.,Operator,4392938
,,,,
17032,Question-and-Answer,"Great. Thank you and congratulations on the sustained ARR growth of 12% nicely above the base rate of 10% that you talked about. What will it take for ARR to accelerate even more above this 12% year level to say 20% beyond the potential pressure on OpEx to fund that growth? Meaning like if you can maybe divvied up [ph] between ASP uplift from CDP migrations, customers adopting more CDP SKUs or customer adds driven by public CDP and if all, parse it up then for me as well?",Nehal Chokshi,4392938
,,,,
17033,Question-and-Answer,"Sure. Thanks for joining the call. There's a few things there. Recognize where we've been and a bit of the migration that we've gone through in this fiscal year. We've been very focused on making sure we're bringing the customer base through a planning process to be able to be in a position to adopt CDP public and/or private as we've been able to make that available. As you know, we continue to evolve progress with CDP public. CDP private came out in August. We continue to make good progress for CDP private and we've been able to bring truly that interoperability between public and private to achieve our enterprise data cloud vision for hybrid multi-cloud. And so now that we have those in market, now that we have production environments that customers can truly move and begin to move their workloads on to in real time, that's begin to, as you've seen in the numbers, pick up some momentum behind it. There's some other things that you're aware of that we've been doing, like variable pricing, like moving the bits behind the paywall that are also working and contributing to growth. As we move into next year, the way we will continue to expand is we?ll see more and more benefit from variable pricing. We'll see more and more benefit from leaving the bits behind the paywall. We're going to be able to now maintain the operating margin that Jim talked about earlier in the call. We think we'll be able to maintain that at the traditional levels that he mentioned. It will still have the ability to invest in things that will help drive growth. We're going to add more capacity into the deal for next year so that we can move beyond just our customer base. And now that we have CDP hybrid in the market, both public and private, we're going to be able to now take that to prospects beyond the customer base. We're seeing benefit from the digital transformation that Mick?s led to where we can now engage digitally with customers that we've not traditionally been able to touch, because we've had limited capacity. We've done a great job of being able to get our product to be able to be consumable on a full digital basis versus we were days, maybe even weeks before the environment could be run. Now we're literally minutes. And that pledges now being able to go down market in very targeted sectors and be able to get the benefit of digital engagement from awareness all the way through consumption and monetization. So it's a number of these things that we're going to be doing that are going to begin to move this into a higher ? consistently higher growth mode where we're eventually back to growing at the market rate that I think we're very well positioned to be growing at.",Rob Bearden,4392938

17035,Question-and-Answer,Is it too early to start talking about percent of ARR that's coming from public or hybrid?,Nehal Chokshi,4392938
,,,,
17036,Question-and-Answer,"It is. We?ll clearly learn what the patterns are and what the distribution will be between public and private. What our customers want is CDP hybrid. They really want to be able to have a true hybrid environment, as mentioned earlier, slightly differently. We think most of the existing workloads move over to private, they'll expand some on private, some to public. Net new workloads will begin on public and then they'll be able to leverage the private capabilities. And then they'll also be able to also expand to the lifecycle of data experience beyond just the management of data as a single platform.",Rob Bearden,4392938

,,,,
17039,Question-and-Answer,"Great. Thanks very much. Jim, the 315 million of bookings you guided to for 4Q implies a fairly significant sequential decel, anything going on there?",Brad Reback,4392938
,,,,
17040,Question-and-Answer,"Are you talking about the footnote in the fillings ? billings are fairly immaterial for us. Our focus is on ARR. What I'll say is billings hasn't been a very good measure partly because of how we change the billing practice for Hortonworks from a multiyear prepaid to annual upfront, and that is still being washed out. So you have business that would normally be billed in Q4 that was billed Q4s ago. So that's part of what's going on. In addition, in any given quarter, you have deals that are pulled forward or postponed that dramatically affects billings. And once again, I?m not overly focused on the billings number for Q4 because it's all about ARR. And ARR will much more closely approximate revenue growth than it will billings.",Jim Frankola,4392938
,,,,
17041,Question-and-Answer,"Got it. And then maybe one just quick follow up for Rob. Given the multitude of growth vectors that you've talked about on the call, why is buying back $500 million of stock the right opportunity versus funding those more aggressively? Typically, we don't see growth software companies buying back that magnitude of stock relative to market cap. Thanks.",Brad Reback,4392938
,,,,
17042,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. So we're very comfortable we can fund those growth initiatives within the parameters of the operating margins that we guided to and Jim mentioned. But look, with the status of the debt market and the multiple of our stocks trading right now, we think it just represents a great opportunity to buy back here. We're very confident in CDP. We're very confident with our customer adoption, what we're seeing on a go-forward basis. And we are very confident in our competitive positioning. And if the share price where it is coupled with our competence, we think it's a great buying opportunity and we fully intend to execute on it.",Rob Bearden,4392938

,,,,
17057,Presentation,"Thanks, Annie. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. It?s hard to believe that we are almost at the end of 2020 and just how challenging the year has been for so many people. Many companies, including DocuSign are still working remotely, collaborating virtually and balancing multiple demand. ",Dan Springer,4392936
,,,,
17058,Presentation,,Dan Springer,4392936
,,,,
17059,Presentation,"However, we?ve also seen the critical role that innovation can play at a time like this and how technology can help people adapt in the wake of the pandemic. As COVID-19 has accelerated the digital transformation of key business and agreement processes, DocuSign has become an increasingly essential cloud software platform.",Dan Springer,4392936
,,,,
17060,Presentation,"The last few quarters of heightened demand have offered a glimpse into the long-term growth opportunity we have. I want to share more on that with you today. So, I?ll focus my comments in three main areas. One, strength of Q3?s results; two, why believe today?s Agreement Cloud customers will grow with us over the long-term; and three, the strength of our product development engine and partner ecosystem. ",Dan Springer,4392936
,,,,
17061,Presentation,So Q3 was another exceptional quarter for us. We saw results significantly outperform this quarter with billings growth of 63% year over year and revenue growth of 53% year over year leading to record levels of profitability. ,Dan Springer,4392936
,,,,
17062,Presentation,"Our international business also showed substantial strength with revenue up 77% year-over-year, now representing only 20% of total revenue. We landed 73,000 new customers bringing our total to nearly 822,000 worldwide, and our customers expanded their use of DocuSign at the highest levels we?ve seen to date yielding a net revenue retention rate of 122%. ",Dan Springer,4392936
,,,,
17063,Presentation,These results reflect how the team has executed with excellence amid the ongoing challenges. They also showcased the continued tailwinds for the expansion of eSignature as the first step in the adoption of the Agreement Cloud. ,Dan Springer,4392936
,,,,
17064,Presentation,"Overall, the response to COVID-19 has caused organizations to accelerate their digital transformation efforts by two, three, four years or more. They?ve seen that remote work can be even more productive, and the digital agreement processes are fast becoming business as usual. Let me share more on how our customers are doing that today. ",Dan Springer,4392936
,,,,
17065,Presentation,"One example is an international ecommerce customer. To ensure their business processes could keep pace with the growth driven by the pandemic, they deployed DocuSign CLM in Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, the UK, and the U.S. By automating contract management for more than 1,500 different agreements with vendors and partners, they are lowering risks, costs, and errors. ",Dan Springer,4392936
,,,,
17066,Presentation,"Another example is one of our large U.S. public school districts. They needed to adapt quickly to help tens of thousands of employees and over 300,000 students to teach and learn remotely. By partnering with DocuSign, they completed Federal funding forms electronically and launched a virtual back-to-school program, and they are now planning hundreds of use cases to support other future needs. ",Dan Springer,4392936
,,,,
17067,Presentation,"One more example is a large U.S. insurance customer. As part of the response to COVID-19, the company expanded into several new eSignature use cases, which drove nearly 100,000 additional transactions over just the past seven months. ",Dan Springer,4392936
,,,,
17068,Presentation,"As I alluded to earlier, the insurer believes this will become business as usual from hereon in . This last point reinforces something that history has taught us at DocuSign. When customers go from paper-based processes to digital agreement processes, they do not go back. We believe that trend will hold when the pandemic subsides, and DocuSign?s value will persist no matter how the future of work unfolds. We are not waiting for the future though, as we continue to innovate across the entire Agreement Cloud suite. ",Dan Springer,4392936
,,,,
17069,Presentation,"In September, we launched an important new product called DocuSign Analyzer. Imagine receiving a new contract from a vendor and having risks automatically flagged like a bad indemnification clause or the absence of a clause you?d normally expect, Analyzer makes this possible. Thanks to the legal AI Technology we acquired with Seal Software earlier this year. ",Dan Springer,4392936
,,,,
17070,Presentation,,Dan Springer,4392936
,,,,
17071,Presentation,"It?s a fantastic timesaver for legal teams and their business stakeholders. It can also integrate with DocuSign CLM helping to automatically route work differently depending on analyzer?s output, sending a high-risk contract to a more senior legal approver for example. I am pleased with how quickly we?ve been able to apply Seal?s technology in this new and exciting way. ",Dan Springer,4392936

17072,Presentation,"Speaking of acquisitions, we talked last quarter about Liveoak Technologies, and how that would accelerate our efforts with DocuSign Notary. We are on track to deliver the beta version of the product before the end of this fiscal year. This will enable a notary transaction to occur entirely over video with the notary and participants all in different places. ",Dan Springer,4392936
,,,,
17073,Presentation,"It will also complement our existing capacity to support in-person and video conference-based notarization in the U.S. and the witnessing approach commonly used in the UK and EMEA. Our partner ecosystem was another area of strength and growth for Q3. As a reminder, this ecosystem includes ISVs that integrate DocuSign into their own solutions, systems integrators that build practices around the Agreement Cloud, and resellers to drive sales reach for us globally. ",Dan Springer,4392936
,,,,
17074,Presentation,"We continue to see overall traction with our more than 350 ISV integrations, including those announced in Q3 with Slack and with Workplace from Facebook. These follow a familiar pattern for us to make DocuSign available wherever business gets done. And with our recent momentum, we continue to see new partners join our ecosystem at a healthy clip.",Dan Springer,4392936
,,,,
17075,Presentation,"There is also been increased interest from SIs looking to build out Agreement Cloud practices that attach to their existing Salesforce, Oracle, SAP, and Workday practices thereby embedding DocuSign even deeper into critical front- and back-office business processes. ",Dan Springer,4392936
,,,,
17076,Presentation,"Lastly, our resellers including the likes of Carahsoft, Ingram Micro, and Insight to name just a few are seeing heightened demand for DocuSign too helping to drive sales through that channel. A great proof point is that Salesforce, as part of its revenue cloud business will now resell DocuSign Gen for Salesforce CPQ+, a product that generates agreements for Salesforce. ",Dan Springer,4392936
,,,,
17077,Presentation,"This creates incredible scale and reach, and typically leads to customers looking to DocuSign for broader agreement automation and CLM initiatives. ",Dan Springer,4392936
,,,,
17078,Presentation,"So, to wrap up my comments today, this is the third quarter in a row that we had these significant levels of growth. This acceleration in demand is laying the foundation for future expansion across the Agreement Cloud. And while substantial global, social, and economic challenges undoubtedly remain, we believe we are still just scratching the surface of our long-term opportunity.",Dan Springer,4392936
,,,,
17079,Presentation,"Before handing it over to Cynthia to walk you through our Q3 results in more detail, I want to share one other great piece of news. Cain Hayes, the CEO of Gateway Health has joined our Board of Directors. I am thrilled to have Cain providing strategic counsel to DocuSign and to me, especially given his track record in financial services and healthcare, two of our largest verticals.

17080,Presentation,"So that is from me. Cynthia, over to you. ",Dan Springer,4392936
,,,,
17081,Presentation,"Great. Thanks, Dan and thank you all for joining us today. As Dan mentioned, our Q3 execution was strong highlighted by our eSignature offering which drove the vast majority of our performance as customers continue to accelerate their digital initiatives.

17083,Presentation," International revenue reached $76 million in the third quarter or 20% of total revenue. Our international business grew over 77% year-over-year reflecting our continued growth across geographies. This quarter we nearly tripled our new and direct customer additions compared to Q3 last year with nearly 73,000 total new customers, of which approximately 14,000 were direct customers.

17090,Presentation,"Now on to our guidance. Amidst the ongoing macro uncertainties, we have seen tremendous demand for our products this year as businesses have accelerated their digital initiatives and moved quickly to adapt to the new environment.

,,,,
17099,Presentation,"Thank you again for joining us today. And now, I?d like to open up the call for questions. Operator?",Cynthia Gaylor ,4392936
,,,,
17100,Presentation,[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. You may proceed with your question. ,Operator,4392936
,,,,
17101,Presentation,"Thanks and welcome Cynthia to your first earnings call. Just one question from my side, and it?s one that I get most from investors at the moment, and that is how much of your revenue growth is being impacted by existing customers that are either coming back to buy more envelopes or per seat pricing where they hit that level of reasonable volume and then they have to really kind of come in and either buy envelopes or upsell. So, if you can maybe quantify or characterize how much of that benefit, and when they do buy, what are they buying? So, are they going to a multi-year or just a bigger batch of envelopes, that?d be great? Thank you. ",Sterling Auty ,4392936
,,,,
17102,Presentation,"Yes, Sterling, I think the way to think about this is it?s a little bit of all of the above, first off right. And if you think about our model which is a capacity model, so it?s not a ? like an overage model where you see in some businesses. So people are buying capacity, and oftentimes it happens just as you articulated people will come back and they say, ?you know we?ve used up our capacity and we need to renew,? or sometime before they get to that point they?ve used up the volume level that they?ve sort of contracted with us to use, and they need to sort of true that up early, and we?ll work with them to do an early renewal. And I think what we are seeing right now more than ever is that because people are putting more and more existing customers of their business processes on with DocuSign, they are more rapidly getting to a place where they?ve used up that capacity. They might have planned it as a three-year growth, and at the end of the year and a half or two, they are not at that new level, so they are coming back to us saying we want to renew and up the volume. Some people do buy by seats, as you said. Most people buy by a message capacity when we are talking about our eSignature business, which of course is still the largest part of our business. But even if someone does buy on a seat basis, we have a reasonable use per seat. So in the end and the right way to think about the business is, it is messaging volume. It is the capacity of agreements they are putting through the system, it is what drives that increase in demand which then leads them to up the contract with us. So that?s kind of what?s happening and my sense about it is, it?s really the faster adoption that?s driving this, that?s coming from people putting more and more of their use cases on to DocuSign. ",Dan Springer,4392936
,,,,
17103,Presentation,Got it. Thank you. ,Sterling Auty ,4392936
,,,,
17104,Presentation,Our next question comes from the line of Stan Zlotsky with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed with your question. ,Operator,4392936
,,,,
17105,Presentation,"Perfect. Thank you so much. Wanted to dig in for a second on just the adoption of the broader Agreement Cloud. What are you guys seeing as far as the ability to upsell the entire Agreement Cloud beyond just eSignatures, things like SpringCM Seal into your rapidly growing installed base? And then I have a quick follow-up. ",Stan Zlotsky ,4392936
,,,,
17106,Presentation,"Let me give you a sense of the arc we?ve had, Stan, over the last year. If you recall when we finished Q4 last year, the message we had was there was a fairly significant acceleration in particularly CLM, which was the major additional Agreement Cloud product we had at that time, and we were quite excited to see that coming into the New Year. And at the beginning of Q1, we saw that trend continuing.",Dan Springer,4392936
,,,,
17107,Presentation,"After COVID sort of hit and half way through our first quarter, we saw a fairly significant change. We saw customers coming back to us saying, yes, long-term, we want to be Agreement Cloud companies. But right now, we?ve got some critical use cases that we need to get out for signature, and so we saw this dramatic acceleration on the signature side of the business and some slowing of deals and some slowing of those transactions of people who are working with us on the CLM side. I think we?ve seen the same thing throughout the year. And in the last quarter or so, though we started to see that coming back. So, things like the Seal Software, things like CLM, those are now businesses that are returning to the levels we would have expected if they hadn?t been for COVID. And we think CIOs and other business leaders fundamentally had a reaction upfront, which was I can only work on my critical projects. Remember, they were just like DocuSign having to go to a work from home setting and they weren?t in their offices. And so, larger and more complex projects that require a systems integrator or at least some sort of statement of work. Those got pushed out a little bit. Now people are coming back and saying those are critical to our future, and so the Agreement Cloud is right back where we want it to be in terms of top of mind with our customers. And I?ll just give you quick example. I had a call this morning with a very large customer of ours, and they said, ?Hey, we are super excited to be now reaccelerating our plans to roll out CLM,? while they have been dramatically increasing their signature usage over the course of the year. They said,?Now is the time. We are ready to reaccelerate with CLM.? And I think that?s what we are going to see throughout the next few quarters. ",Dan Springer,4392936
,,,,
17108,Presentation,,Dan Springer,4392936
,,,,
17109,Presentation,"Perfect. That makes lot of sense. And maybe a quick follow-up on international, 77% growth very nice acceleration in that segment of the business and might [ph] now are going to be at the helm of it. What are you guys seeing as far as the dynamics in international and rest of the world versus the U.S.? ",Stan Zlotsky ,4392936
,,,,
17110,Presentation,"Well, I think there is a couple thoughts I have and then Cynthia chime in with your perspectives on what you are seeing. The first piece is, remember it?s a much smaller number. So, we expect international to grow faster coming off a smaller base, but we also expect it to grow faster, because we have more levers there relative to the U.S. business in that we have additional countries that we are not in, and we have countries that we are very early in that we see an opportunity to really accelerate.",Dan Springer,4392936
,,,,
17111,Presentation,"That?s I think what you saw in this last quarter is that a lot of the execution efforts we?ve been putting in place over the last several quarters have really come out very nicely in this quarter and popping up to 20%, which is a really important milestone for us. So I still see that happen. I think you are going to see more of the same. You are going to see us doing more in our non-focus eight countries to the newer ones that we?ll be entering primarily using digital as an opportunity to get there in the really efficient way and then in the existing core eight, I think you are going to see an opportunity for us to this U.S. and the other seven to really leverage the investments we?ve made in people and processes investing ahead of that big opportunity for both countries that are substantial as already like you might see in a place like the UK or Canada or earlier like Germany and Japan, we see opportunities for both of those. So, I think you are going to see a really exciting opportunity to continue growth there. ",Dan Springer,4392936
,,,,
17112,Presentation,Perfect. Thank you so much. ,Stan Zlotsky ,4392936
,,,,
17113,Presentation,Our next question comes from the line of Bhavan Suri with William Blair. You may proceed with your question. ,Operator,4392936
,,,,
17114,Presentation,"Thank you. Thanks for taking my question and Cynthia, good to chat and work with you again. It?s a pleasure. I guess, let me touch on something that maybe Stan and Sterling touched on in a different fashion. I think you made it pretty clear and we all get it, no one is going back to pen and paper, but the growth and the acceleration which has been phenomenal. And I guess, do you feel like demand was pulled forward and how should we think? I know you are not giving guidance, but how should we think about next year, if we did see this acceleration pulls forward vertical that may have been slower to adopt accelerating that. How do we sort of handicap or think about that? And then I?ve got a longer term question. ",Bhavan Suri,4392936
,,,,
17115,Presentation,"Sure. And might we had Cynthia chat a little bit about sort of the timing particularly in Q3 and how we saw that play out versus Q4, and going forward, before that let me just give you sort of a high-level perspective. They way I would think about it is TAM based. So, I would start off and say, just talk about signature for a second. When we talk about the sort of $25 billion TAM, that was the same number we?ve been using since the IPO and we continue to see that as a really good metric. We are seeing the opportunity. So, as fast as we are penetrating against that TAM, I think it?s growing as fast. We are still in very early inning. And then when we are opening up the rest of the Agreement Cloud TAM, which is in the order of magnitude of almost doubling that, then we think to ourselves, we are actually not even keeping up with the TAM opportunity which is a high-class problem to have. And so, my view on it is that we?ve seen is not so much a pulling forward of demand that therefore now won?t happen in the future. But that when we are looking at the long game of all of that market opportunity to penetrate, we are just executing at a higher rate today. And so we?ve accelerated that growth, not because we are sort of robbing from the future, but we are just getting closer towards that $25 billion TAM opportunity and with our revenue being under a couple billion and us having such a dramatic market share lead has been such a big portion of the total market. It gives you a sense that I think we can continue to grow at very attractive rates well into the future. ",Dan Springer,4392936
,,,,
17116,Presentation,,Dan Springer,4392936
,,,,
17117,Presentation,"Yes. And let me just ? I would just add to that. I mean, Q3 was really strong and we saw broad based demand across the customer base, whether within new customers or in new expansions in upsells. And so, as Dan said, when you think about the TAM and that our market penetration, we are really just scratching the surface and the kind of new customer growth that we are seeing really creates the foundation for kind of future expansions in upsells kind of across the platform which we are pretty excited about. That being said, I do want to point out Q3 was exceptionally strong and we do see fairly renewals and expansions and tightening of deals that made some of the metrics in Q3, particularly strong on a relative basis year-on-year. And so, it?s just something to consider kind of as you look to the future. ",Cynthia Gaylor ,4392936
,,,,
17118,Presentation,"Got you. Got you. Now that?s really helpful. And I guess, maybe stepping back a little bit, you touched on AI and Dan you and I talked about this over the years just about sort of the broader opportunity. You explained sort of Seal and sort of some of the ability to re-contract. As you think about the amount of data you have, do you think they got to the point where you start doing sort of even deeper contract analysis, the point of you know, hey, you?ve got a contract for x number of seats, you may not realized it but you have actually exceeded it or you haven?t met it. Actually drilling into some of the numerical data in the contracts and then sort of either flagging it and that?s just one example. But love to incent how deep you think the AI ultimately gets on the used cases, because that obviously ends up being a whole analytics TAM and a contract TAM that we aren?t including today. ",Bhavan Suri,4392936
,,,,
17119,Presentation,"Yes. It?s a great way to think about it. And I think the way we have traditionally thought about the first phase of AI was things like the Analyzer product that I described earlier. We said this now gives our legal and business teams the ability to very quickly and efficiently understand where there are sort of outlier clauses or things they should pay particular attention to. But I actually think the most exciting part of that AI is where you are going with your question, which is once we have through a CLM that?s enhanced with our AI capabilities, now companies have the ability to really learn about their business and make intelligent insights about their business based on that body of contracts that they have. And one of my favorite examples is that we see certain institutions saying, I want to understand my risk better, by understanding whether or not I have a whole bunch of contracts that are relevant to a particular sort of cost or something as an example we see this with companies in the chemicals industry to say, oil prices are hugely important to my business cause a variety of contracts have had a way to look across all of them and be thoughtful about what the puts and takes on that, so I can understand the risk and implication to my business by a move in that commodity price. So that?s where I think the really exciting piece comes. And I think you are right, I don?t think we?ve sort of looked at that in our existing TAM, because I don?t think anyone has really built that market to help people do that analysis across all their agreements. And so, I think it is a part of our exciting future. ",Dan Springer,4392936
,,,,
17120,Presentation,Great. That?s helpful. Thanks guys. Congrats. ,Bhavan Suri,4392936
,,,,
17121,Presentation,Our next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with RBC. You may proceed with your question. ,Operator,4392936
,,,,
17122,Presentation,"Hey. Thanks. Cynthia, I like to add my congratulations and Dan, for you as well. I?ve got a kind of two big picture questions. Dan, if you think about, I mean, going back to kind of Sterling?s question around and even Bhavan?s, the biggest question people have is around the durability of growth and you?ve done a great job I think talking about some of the longer duration tailwinds to your business. How should we think around the puts and takes of certain verticals that may have surprisingly strong capacity increases this year that maybe are difficult comps for next year or the opposite verticals that have come back that you expect to actually sustain some of that capacity growth? Or is it as simple as we are starting to see a baton passing from eSignature to CLM that you see sustaining growth next year? And then I?ve got a quick follow-up. ",Alex Zukin ,4392936
,,,,
17123,Presentation,,Alex Zukin ,4392936
,,,,
17124,Presentation,"I think it?s a really interesting question. When we look at it from a vertical standpoint first, as we?ve mentioned before, some of our strongest verticals and that would include financial services, both banking and insurance, that include healthcare life sciences, increasingly government is one we?ve had a lot of enthusiasm about this year, as well. They?ve actually performed incredibly well in this time period for us. ",Dan Springer,4392936
,,,,
17125,Presentation,"Some of the verticals that weren?t as big for us that you would expect to have been hurt of course were, we saw that some small businesses, we definitely saw that travel and hospitality that where people had to sort of put on hold virtually everything as they really new to the trench. So, when you think about it going forward, I don?t expect there could be a significant rotation out of our strong industries and the verticals, again, then we talk about financial services, we talk about healthcare life sciences, I think they are going to be very strong for us next year, as well. ",Dan Springer,4392936
,,,,
17126,Presentation,"The government strength we saw this year, I think, we expect to continue into the year as well. Whether there will be some bounce back with some of the things like travel and hospitality that we are hurt, I mean some energy businesses, as well, I think the answer is, probably. But I don?t know what that cycle time is, I don?t know whether in the first quarter or second quarter or maybe it?s a couple quarters post back, I am not sure how that plays out exactly. ",Dan Springer,4392936
,,,,
17127,Presentation,"But I don?t think that will be a significant driver as the second piece you talked about. And so, as Cynthia just alluded to this in her comment, but if you talk about we?ve been adding such a significant number of new customers on the direct side of our business, 14,000 this quarter. It was 10,000 in each of Q1 and Q2. Those are primarily people coming in with eSignature only, because they need it to get those use cases up and running to get a really important priority for their business in this really challenging time. ",Dan Springer,4392936
,,,,
17128,Presentation,"Those are companies that we are going to aggressively be working a year from now to come back and say, hey, we want to talk to you in your renewal discussions around what additional use cases we have for signature. But also, I must tell you little more about the DocuSign Agreement Cloud and how that?s going to transform your business in a way you might not even have thought about when you became a signature customer. ",Dan Springer,4392936
,,,,
17129,Presentation,So that?s the place where I think we?ll see a bigger opportunity to really maintain substantial growth as Cynthia described. ,Dan Springer,4392936
,,,,
17130,Presentation,"Perfect. And then, an even bigger picture question if I might. If you think about other platforms, software platforms have taken off during this pandemic, like the Zoom as an example, one of the things we are most excited about there is this notion of becoming having to control power end marketplace. I look at your business where you have a lot of network effects, is there a way to also create or see the marketplace for services where you start powering and even to some extent monetizing and adding value to both sides of the transaction? ",Alex Zukin ,4392936
,,,,
17131,Presentation,"Yes. It?s a super ? super interesting, as you said, big picture question. So, when everyone gets newly introduced to DocuSign, I?ll put myself in that category. Four years ago, one of the exciting things is thinking about all the possible places you can take this business and some because of the power of the data that was referred to earlier, but also the network effect that you are sort of describing in what could be a marketplace environment. So, let me really clear. We are a software company. We sell software to companies that use it to run their business. If their customers, their customers? data, we don?t really think about that as information that?s ours to sort of play with. So, that said, we do believe there are probably interesting opportunities where our customers over time could get comfortable with us say, hey, we want to monetize some of what?s happened here in a different way. But I don?t want to give you the sense that that?s like a priority for us today. We look at the core business we had and we look again it has very large TAM. We need to execute for the next several years to achieve our goals of getting to $5 billion of revenue. And then after that, we are going to be talking about $10 billion in revenue. That?s all going to be very achievable based on our current business model. So it?s not that we are not interesting people here with interesting ideas about the expansion opportunities you are describing. I just want to be clear that?s not part of the core business today. We are a software company. We serve our customers when they buy software from us. That will be, I believe the primary thing we do for the years to come. ",Dan Springer,4392936
,,,,
17132,Presentation,,Dan Springer,4392936
,,,,
17133,Presentation,"Awesome. Great to hear, Dan. We?ll hold you to that $10 billion target. Thanks again. ",Alex Zukin ,4392936
,,,,
17134,Presentation,Any day now. Any day now. ,Dan Springer,4392936
,,,,
17135,Presentation,Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. You may proceed with your question.,Operator,4392936
,,,,
17136,Presentation,"Thank you. And maybe one for Dan, one for Cynthia. Dan, if I could go back to the question of the upsell of the broader Agreement Cloud or CLM suite, you gave some good color. But I am wondering if you could quantify it a little bit. For instance, is there any way that you could quantify what portion of new ACV might be from this versus eSignature or the portion of your largest 100 customers that you?ve successfully upsold the broader Agreement Cloud into anything that might more specifically let us know how far along that journey you are as exciting as it is? ",Karl Keirstead ,4392936
,,,,
17137,Presentation,"Yes, it?s still pretty early in that journey. We are at a position right now where if you look at our financials, it?s going to be a while before I believe the non-signature part of our business will be meaningful enough to sort of warrant that kind of break out. And when we done acquisitions like, what we did with Spring on the CLM side and what we did with Seal, we sort of shared what kind of the revenue was in those businesses. And if you recall, they are very, very small relative to a business that?s passed the $1 billion last year and before long we?ll be hitting $2 billion. So those are just really, really small at this point in time. The challenge is, initially I thought it would be sooner when we be having that conversation, but the reality is, is if this reacceleration of signature that?s occurred this year, I mean, we started off, I?d be really clear, we started every conversation with a customer today saying, we want to talk to you about the DocuSign Agreement Cloud. That?s every new customer, as well as each customer we come into talk about renewals. But we?ve also this year more than ever, and we?ve finished that sort of explanation or articulation of the power of that Agreement Cloud vision. Most of them this year have said, that?s fantastic and I look forward to doing that, but I need some signature today. And as I tell our sales people, there is only one answer to that question, which is, yes ma?am or yes sir, we?ve got signature for you today. And so, I think you are going to see that, that is going to be the reality of the next I would say several quarters, we are still seeing this demand as just so strong on signature. And it?s almost hard for the folks that are CLM focused or Seal focused to sort of get attention to keep up with that rate. So, Cynthia, you can give a perspective on your thoughts on when we?d be in a position to talk about that further. But I just don?t think we can really quantify it yet, because it?s still so small. ",Dan Springer,4392936
,,,,
17138,Presentation,"Got it. Okay. And maybe this next question is to, Cynthia, and Cynthia, you are probably going to dodge us, I understand. But, one of the issues with DocuSign shares is that you are about to say some very tough comps starting in Q1 next year. So, I am sure you don?t want to give guide on this call, but is there any framework you can provide? Should we think about sort of a return to pre-COVID sequential growth rates as a starting point to model next year? Is there any framework you could provide before maybe giving more formalized guidance, I presume on the next call? ",Karl Keirstead ,4392936
,,,,
17139,Presentation,"Yes. That?s right. And thank you for the questions. We?ll be giving guidance for next year on our Q4 call. I think what you got though is we will have tough compares going into next year and even in Q4, our Q4 last year was very strong and it was a significant quarter on its own sight. I would expect going into next year, we?ll be looking at kind of the guidance and we?ll be looking across the matters and as you know we guide to what we see and so, we?ll have that conversation next quarter when we chat with you all.

,,,,
17142,Presentation,Our next question comes from the line of Scott Berg with Needham and Company. You may proceed with your question. ,Operator,4392936
,,,,
17143,Presentation,"Well, this is Alex on for Scott. Thanks for taking my question. As you look back over the last two quarters, either the composition of the initial purchase of the channel that the customers are coming to change meaningfully or have deals been coming in similarly to what pre-pandemic compositions were and or was there just a larger quantity ? that?s been happening? ",Unidentified Analyst,4392936
,,,,
17144,Presentation,"Yes, I can tell you, the deals that we have coming in have had a higher focus on signature in the last few quarters and as I mentioned before, we saw that that was growing for these rest of the Agreement Cloud going up to Q4 of last year and into the beginning of Q1 this year and then Signature has just been explosive for all the good reasons we?ve already talked about. And so, as I stated there is an increase in that mix in that direction. But I would say, the rest of the green side that have been holding it just hasn?t been growing its share the way it had been growing substantially, again off of very, very small base, but growing its position there. And then from a standpoint of the channels, we?ve been investing a lot in the digital channel versus the direct sales channel. It?s still about 15% of our revenue, plus almost 90% of our customers and I think that, we?ve seen real strength there. And I think, we are going to continue to see strength and you are going to see us talking in the future about the investments we want to make to move even more and more of our customer in new acquisitions to come through the digital business, which we think is going to be a super cost-effective way for us to scale our growth. ",Dan Springer,4392936
,,,,
17145,Presentation,"Yes. One thing I would just add to that is, is that you do look at the customer growth numbers, whether it?s the total or the direct versus digital, you can really see that strength kind of across the board up and down the customer base. And so, it really is kind of broad based within that and that we are seeing across customers and companies. ",Cynthia Gaylor ,4392936
,,,,
17146,Presentation,"Great. Thank you. And then just one more for me. Given Salesforce acquisition next week, that seems to have a broader implication to valuation with that. How are you thinking about M&A valuations giving your willing appetite for M&A in the past? ",Unidentified Analyst,4392936
,,,,
17147,Presentation,"Yes, I think, we?ve been very specific about what we?ve tried to do with our M&A strategy, which is to say, we are not looking from a strategy standpoint for sort of blockbuster deals in terms of buy lots of revenue per se. We?ve been trying to stick to our strategy that we think our customers want us to drive which is the DocuSign Agreement Cloud. So, when we do acquisitions, like you think about the three deals we?ve done since I?ve been here, you?ll see they all have very similar characteristics, which is someone has a product, probably not super mature business, but are products that we look at and say, we need to have that functionality in our Agreement Cloud suite and we could build it on our own, but we think that they have some domain expertise. We think that it built a little bit of a business there. They?ve sort of got a market fit that we are ? a product market fit that we are comfortable with. And we think it will accelerate our ability to build out those products and services for our customers. I think we?ll probably be looking at doing the same thing. ",Dan Springer,4392936
,,,,
17148,Presentation,"So in terms of the valuation question, I am certain that the issue we already have today when we acquire a company, and they look at us and they go, we love you to buy us at the same multiple that DocuSign has. I don?t think that?s going to change and I?ll start with that position and politely I?ll probably remind them that we?ve achieved some things in our business as they probably haven?t yet in terms of scale, growth and profitability. And therefore we might not ? as we have not yet come close to giving some on the same multiple that we have. But I don?t think other deals like Slack deal will fundamentally change the perspective of valuations and just my view on it is, they paid a slight premium to the peak multiple that Slack had. And that to me is sort of more of the same as opposed to sort of earth shattering multiple. But I think it is obviously clear that for entrepreneurs out there with that business is it probably makes them smile. ",Dan Springer,4392936

17151,Presentation,Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Walravens with JMP Group. You may proceed with your question. ,Operator,4392936
,,,,
17152,Presentation,"Great. Thank you, and congratulations. So, Dan, what is the top priority today for your development organization, like where are you concentrating your R&D dollars? What do you want the solutions to do in the future that it can?t do today? ",Patrick Walravens ,4392936
,,,,
17153,Presentation,"So, I put it in three buckets, and I?ll do them in priority order for you since you are asking about top, but it?s kind of hard not to think about them all three, Pat, for me. The first one is, this sort of integration of the AI capability that we had ? we purchased with Seal and Analyzer is the first example that?s fantastic. But there is a ton more where we take that AI capability and bring it into our overall product suite, so we have a huge focus on integrating that team and integrating that technology, we think it?s going to be as we talked about on earlier questions, hugely important part of building this significant opportunity that we have. ",Dan Springer,4392936
,,,,
17154,Presentation,"Second piece is, Notary. I think we look at this Notary and a lot of people think of it is a - as a smaller thing. We think it can actually be really significant. There is third-party Notary. There is going to be first-party Notary that we are attacking first, but we think that opportunity there is a very specific thing that we are aggressively going after and then we think about that as being part of our sign business, as opposed to really a separate component. But clearly, it?s an additional growth opportunity for us on the sign side. ",Dan Springer,4392936
,,,,
17155,Presentation,"And then the third piece for me is, it really is about this macro opportunity of the Agreement Cloud and making sure we are stitching together all of the pieces that one thing as we buy these other companies sometimes they are small, they don?t have our kind of uptime capability. They don?t have the quality of service that we have and they are not integrated completely to using partners that we sort of jointly sold before. We have APIs, but we haven?t really fully integrated them into a one platform. And so, I think getting that platform, the place where we want it to be will be the third of those important development priority. ",Dan Springer,4392936

17157,Presentation,Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. You may proceed with your question. ,Operator,4392936
,,,,
17158,Presentation,"Hi. Thank you. First question for Cynthia. Just on NRR, I mean, I think, we?ve seen a lot of times when companies add a lot of customers like that, the number start get bigger that the NRR comes down. You?ve actually seen it go the opposite direction. I am just wondering if you can help us understand sort of the puts and takes over the next couple quarters on NRR as we are looking at that number and how it trends. ",Walter Pritchard ,4392936
,,,,
17159,Presentation,"Yes. So, I think that, as I said, that we hit a record in net retention numbers this quarter at the 122. It?s a second time we?ve been at 120 or greater and I think that was really driven by the expansions in upsells that we saw across the board, as Dan said, led mainly by eSignature, but also kind of building the ? opportunity. So, I would say, as you know, our churn has largely been stable in regards to that, but the expansions are really driven by the sales that we saw in Q3. ",Cynthia Gaylor ,4392936
,,,,
17160,Presentation,"Yes. And I think your question about the implication going forward, I think the first implication is just what you said is that our customers are saying they want to do more DocuSign. They want to use this in different ways. And I think we continue to see that both within the signature business and Cynthia was describing, but also customers saying they want to expand into that for the Agreement Cloud, which also gives us another way to turbo charge that number. At the same time, I think as we go forward, we are not at this point changing our historic change that we talked about since the time of the IPO of saying that?s going to be kind of in that piece, 112, 113 on the low end and to get up to a 119 or so on the high end. But let?s get through this year, get through Q4 and see if then maybe want to reassess that because there are some puts and takes. There are some adjustments. We do think about the potential for churn. We don?t have this as long as the pandemic is going to last and I have a lot of enthusiasm about a vaccine. But I think that?s going to, in the next quarter or two, have a significant impact on the economy and we do worry about small businesses. So I think we just want to give us another quarter and then if we are going to take a hard look at that, and assess whether the success we?ve had would lead us to increasing our expectation for that range going forward and I agree with you it?s somewhat unusual to see an accelerating rate there. But I think we are somewhat unusual as a company again that we have such a strong market leadership position and such a large TAM that I think is conceivable that we could continue to see that kind of acceleration. ",Dan Springer,4392936
,,,,
17161,Presentation,,Dan Springer,4392936
,,,,
17162,Presentation,"Got it. And then, actually another question for you, Cynthia. On OpEx, I mean, I think we are seeing a lot of companies in this environment actually see the OpEx growth significantly tampered by COVID lack of see me and so forth. Your OpEx has actually grown in line with what it grew last year and I am just wondering where you sort of hit the gap to accelerate that OpEx? I assume you saw the same lack of see me and so forth. And then, how are you thinking about OpEx going forward and return on the investments that you are making? ",Walter Pritchard ,4392936
,,,,
17163,Presentation,"Yes. It?s a great question. I think what we are trying to invest for top-line growth, right and sometimes when you had outperformance on the top-line, it?s hard to reinvest that in the quarter at the same REIT. We got 6 points of margin improvement year-on-year. The areas that we are really kind of lean heavily into grow the top-line is around sales and marketing, particularly capacity, customer get backs and then product innovation and all the areas that Dan talked about on one of the earlier questions that we?ll make dollar trade-offs to grow top-line before we improve margin. But I think the outperformance that we are seeing is driving to pretty impressive levels year-on-year. ",Cynthia Gaylor ,4392936

17165,Presentation,Our next question comes from the line of Taylor McGinnis with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed with your question. ,Operator,4392936
,,,,
17166,Presentation,"Yes. Hi. Congrats on the quarter and thanks for taking my question. So, you?ve had a record number of underprice in commercial customer adds the last three quarters. So, just as we look ahead into next year and beyond, can you maybe talk about any expectations you have for how you expect those customers to ramp over time? I am curious if you have seen any changes in trends or trends in the size of lands today and how those customers expect to expand usage and maybe similar to one of the previous questions, what does that say about the durability of the net retention levels we?ve seen recently? ",Taylor McGinnis ,4392936
,,,,
17167,Presentation,"Yes. Interesting there has not been a lot of variation on that front. So the sizes of lands, the pricing of the deals what we?ve been doing, they?ve been then amazingly consistent even though the volume as you point out has been more substantial. There has been a small amount of mix shift, I talked about the direct business being very strong for us. But we?ve also seen those web upgrades that we talked about where we call that positive churn. Someone comes to us on the digital business and they get ? they start growing with us and we create a direct relationship with them with the sales person being involved. And so, that?s been accelerating and taking a bigger part of our business sort of pulling them out of the digital business if you will. So, it?s nothing I?d point you, Taylor, that sort of seems to me fundamentally different that would give us any reason to expect that the journey, the customers would take in terms of their growth coming from that land and expand would be different. And then, to get to the second part of your question, what would that implication for the retention rate will be, it maybe some ? a mass piece that over my head that I am missing. But I would expect it probably then to not have a significant impact on the retention rate if there was nothing different in the nature of those lands. So, but my guess, would be, but I give you a little more thought, I guess, we wouldn?t see any change in that path that customers that average path, customers are taking with us for this new crop of new customers that are coming in even though they are bigger class, I think ? we think they would probably perform the same way previous classes had as well.

17170,Presentation,Our next question comes from the line of Koji Ikeda with Oppenheimer. You may proceed with your question. ,Operator,4392936
,,,,
17171,Presentation,"Hey, thanks. Congrats on a great quarter. I wanted to ask you a question on DocuSign?s branding and really specifically internationally, from our lands in the U.S., that it sort of seems like DocuSign has a great chance of becoming the next brand to become a verb like your Xerox, as an Ubers and CleanX maybe it already has, but what about internationally? Does DocuSign already have that sort of market awareness and positioning internationally? Or is that still the comp? ",Koji Ikeda ,4392936
,,,,
17172,Presentation,"Yes. So it?s great question. In fact, Forrester did couple years ago put out a report saying we already had become a brand. I think that same way you talked about like CleanX or Xerox. So, Koji, we are a step ahead. We already got that piece done in the U.S. as you indicated. We just actually recently did a study couple months ago and Rob Giglio, our CMO looked at our brand in a variety of different markets and what we found is that the aided awareness was quite strong. But the unaided awareness was not as strong as it might be and clearly not as is in the U.S. and the fundamental difference is that, in the U.S. recall that we took a very significant position within the real estate space and so many people when buying homes or leasing apartments got familiar with using DocuSign. So it?s at a point that, if I go some places I work at DocuSign the vast, vast majority of the people get what we call Docu love story and they come back and tell, gosh, I was traveling on a vacation, and was able to buy a home or I started a new job and I was able to sign that when I was traveling and all those wonderful stories that you and I talked about that happens with our brand. If you are in different markets overseas, particularly some of the markets where we have had sort of less growth and I?d put sort of the Germanys and Japans as an example if we don?t have that same brand awareness. It?s starting to happen and we are going to be looking in the coming years to invest in different ways to build that greater brand awareness because the real estate market won?t be the same. It?s just very different in the U.S. than it is most other countries. It won?t give us that same vehicle to do it. We are looking at focusing on our digital business and using digital advertising, which of course is customer acquisition-oriented. But we?ll also have a component of brand building for us. So that?s going to be a big part of our marketing plan in the coming year. And I will look forward to at some point during the year, given the opportunity to share with you all what we are seeing in terms of success of those investments. But the last thing I would tell you is, even though we, in some of these countries do not have the same sort of leadership position of our brand, nobody else does either. So when we get to those other markets, there is no other DocuSign of with that same sort of presence in another country. So we haven?t lost that opportunity to take that global leadership position in each of the key international markets where want to be and that?s what we intend to do just that. ",Dan Springer,4392936
,,,,
17173,Presentation,"Got it. Got it. Super helpful. And just one follow-up question on the government opportunity. I know you guys been talking about your IO4 government datacenter. Could you please remind us is that certified now? And if it is, how do we think about the certified datacenter and your certification. I mean, could 2021 be an inflection year from the government opportunity? I mean, what sort of go to market investments are you making for that government vertical opportunity. Thanks for taking my questions. ",Koji Ikeda ,4392936
,,,,
17174,Presentation,,Dan Springer,4392936
,,,,
17175,Presentation,"Yes. The IO4 is actually built and it?s operational and we?ve actually put volume through it. There is additional an organization called DIFA more than probably everyone know in the Federal government has a final certification requirement that we expect shortly. But we are already working with agencies on that functionality and capability and we are excited about it the same way when we got Fed ramp certification. We continue to put ourselves in a position with the Federal government, and by the way it does trickle down a lot of states really look at that as being important even if they don?t necessarily require the certification, it gives them comfort. So we see that in local and state governments as well. And we think we feel really good about that positioning as the sort of preeminent provider in the agreement space to the agencies. So, from a standpoint ? when you said ?21, I assume you meant calendar ?21 not fiscal ?21 and we actually think fiscal ?21 this past year has actually been, I don?t think a lot of inflection point, but incredibly strong for us in government and so many agencies now have requirements to do things, particularly around eSignature with a company like DocuSign. So, we expect that to continue to be a strength. I think we are looking at different ways that we can invest in sort of the marketing to be more effective and getting the breadth of our message out to all the different particularly Federal agencies. And I think, well, I think we?ve done good sales execution. I would say that we have an opportunity to a better job on sort of marketing and business development aspects at sort of the top side of that funnel with the various government agencies. And so, we will look at that in fiscal ?22, calendar ?21 to accelerate that to do even more. ",Dan Springer,4392936

17178,Presentation,[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Rishi Jaluria with D.A. Davidson. You may proceed with your question. ,Operator,4392936
,,,,
17179,Presentation,"Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question and nice to see continued acceleration on the business. I just wanted to go back to the ongoing theme of the questions which is thinking about DocuSign in the post-pandemic world, Dan, what I understand we are not going back to pen and paper we are doing things, but you also talked about how customers are accelerating their digital transformation by three to four years. As you think about that post-pandemic world and given all the high expansion rates and everything you are seeing, does that pace of acceleration maybe slow down now that there is less urgency with the remote work or is there enough opportunity in the land that you?ve gotten with the core digital signature product that you can keep up that sort of acceleration with your cross-selling getting people in the CLM. Maybe help us understand how you think about that? Thanks. ",Rishi Jaluria ,4392936
,,,,
17180,Presentation,"Yes. So let me tell what I know and what I don?t know. What I know is what Cynthia just reported to you which we had some that I can say for the last three quarters, the highest rate of billings growth we?ve ever had in our history and didn?t think that what happened this quarter after last quarter and it did given the compare in Q4, as you see the guide, I don?t think we would say we expect that to happen again by any means next quarter. But the growth has been very strong and has been consistent. So the tricky part to your question is in the post-pandemic, I have no idea when that?s coming and anymore than anything other people on this call, my sense is that, it has been accelerant to our business. So there would be some lack of that accelerant in the ? occurring in a post-pandemic world. But at the same time I think the second part of your question which is really important is, we are also hitting our stride with the capabilities we have in the rest of the Agreement Cloud. And we?ve also built a lot of sales capacity right as we?ve seen this opportunity and because the TAM is so big, I think the biggest determinant of our ability to grow is our ability to onboard quality people that can build the software that we need and then represent and sell that software into the marketplace so we can then work with that customers success to drive adoption. So, if we can continue to scale our team effectively, I think we can continue to grow at very exciting rates. So I think that?s kind of how I look at it right now. And I do think it?s going to be a little while before we realize what the new normal will be and what we said the last couple of quarters but I still think is what we say it today is that, at some point, the sort of enormity of the tailwind that is there will be less enormous, but it may be substantial that people have said digital transformation is what I need now and they flip the bet and we will continue to see strong growth of that. But my assumption not really having any detailed ability to guess the future is that that growth will be at a higher rate than we were at pre-COVID happening, but probably not at the same growth rate that we?ve seen in the last few quarters where it?s been amazingly heightened. So, I think it will be very strong growth and probably higher than you?ve seen previously. And so when we look at our revenue growth I think you?ll see next quarter when Cynthia pulls together. I think what you will see is an exciting growth future for us and probably from a billing standpoint, slightly below the incredible numbers we?ve put up the last few quarters. ",Dan Springer,4392936

17186,Presentation,Hey there. Thanks and good afternoon. Just one from me.

,,,,
17189,Presentation,"Yes, absolutely, sorry, I got confused on the partner side. Yes, so, I would say that, we think it?s a significant part and one of the things that?s interesting when you think about our partners, and this happened before we did the CLM acquisition of Spring CM where people previously had said, yes we love DocuSign, customers love DocuSign, but software is pretty good. It?s pretty easy to implement and there is not really an opportunity for us to make enough money in sort of implementing it. Then with Spring, we saw people say, hey, you are getting into a broader base software tool that requires a significantly SOW to be installed and there is real opportunity. And we saw the SI community sort of work with us more aggressively to become partners and we see that happening more so, because of Insight. And I think people realize there is a lot of opportunity to deliver fantastic value for our end joint customers if they are providing services. So, I one of you have heard us talk about is we are actually trying to decrease even though it?s a small ? I am talking about 4% of our revenue being services, decreasing that as a percentage going forward not because we are going to reduce the service as we do, but we are just going to move so much more at the growth into the partner ecosystem. So that?s kind of how we look at that. We think it?s going to be a significant piece with a lot of excitement about partners and particularly SIs that want to leverage Insight into the work they do with our joint customers.

But are they at the right level in the organization to have that question that conversation say a year from now meaning, are you landing higher up in your customer organization, so that when they are raising and coming back around and have that discussion there at the level that the kind of business process changes required or really that could help change the entire business that they have the authority frankly to just starting to have those conversations, because you are obviously getting into CLM. It opens up so many interesting sort of avenues from a business process perspective. So, just sort the sum is, are you landing high enough up to start those conversations? Thanks. ",Kirk Materne ,4392936

17193,Presentation,,Kirk Materne ,4392936
,,,,
17194,Presentation,"Yes, that?s really thoughtful question. So, first off the danger is, I look at my dataset of the customers I?ve spoken with. We got 34,000 new direct customers in the first nine months. I didn?t talk to too many of them myself. But I would tell you from a trend standpoint I haven?t seen something that feels fundamentally different. So I don?t think we are landing higher or landing lower for that matter. I think our enterprise business has done really well. So it?s probably ? maybe - might be a little mix shift from that standpoint to growth there in more senior relationships. But I can tell you this that we do not have field personnel that do not start now every conversation with the Agreement Cloud. And as I mentioned earlier, just we don?t let someone go out and even if get in RFP in or someone calls up and just says, give me signature right now, you are going to listen to a DocuSign Agreement Cloud pitch I mean it?s going to talk to you of how you are going to prepare, sign, act on and manage your agreements with DocuSign. And that wouldn?t have been true a year ago. We wouldn?t had that in the field enabled to do that. So we are actually doing that. So, my guess is that, anything that?s probably a slight, slight move towards people who are coming in whether they are more senior or not, but they are coming in with a mindset that this is an Agreement Cloud company and this is where they should be going with us and that?s why I first see is probably the trend moving in the future.

There are a number of limitations related to the use of these non-GAAP financial measures versus their closest GAAP equivalents.",Willa McManmon,4392935
,,,,
17204,Presentation,"For example, other companies may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures as a tool for comparison.

,,,,
17218,Presentation,"We also saw digital acceleration increase, every organization is grappling with the new reality that were once structured, planned, and predictable, is now increasingly unstructured, unplanned, and cross-functional. The shift to digital first is a one way door. Consumers appreciate the safety and convenience of life online, and they have little patience for a less than perfect experience. Yet the team's responsible for seamless digital operations historical increases in events, which went unmanaged can cost more than $0.5 million per minute.",Jennifer Tejada,4392935

17245,Presentation,"Beginning early in Q3, we saw customer shift back to strategic projects where improved expansion, along with our Rundeck acquisition helped lift our dollar-based net retention rates, quarter-on-quarter to 119%. This despite the COVID-related churn and contraction we noticed in Q2, we saw particular strength amongst our enterprise customers, where dollar-based net retention increased sequentially above 120%, as several large customers double down with PagerDuty in support of their digital initiatives and DevOps transformation.",Howard Wilson,4392935

You're very, very upbeat report this quarter, I can hear it in your voice, I can hear it in Howard's voice as well. What would you be -- coming out of COVID, what do you think are your top priorities to scale PagerDuty from here?",Joel Fishbein,4392935
,,,,
17272,Question-and-Answer,"That's a great question and it's nice to see you, Joel. I think one; we have to continue to deliver innovation for our customers. We have, I think widened the moat between other competitors that are really focused on on-call. And you can see that in the adoption of our digital operations platform plan. So, continuing to bring innovation, particularly around AI Ops, automation to serve in the use cases is going to be really important to us.",Jennifer Tejada,4392935
,,,,
17273,Question-and-Answer,"I mentioned this as sort of background around our freemium plan, because we have such strong gross margins, it's given us room to experiment with freemium and I was really excited to see that the combination of new free and paid accounts grew 18% year-over-year, that really is our effort towards expanding our reach.",Jennifer Tejada,4392935
,,,,
17274,Question-and-Answer,"We need to build our brand, but it's such it's still such an early market with over 45 million developers and IT personnel out there. We've got to go find them and get them on the platform. So, acquisition and end marketing to build our brand and help the market understand what we do, I think is very important.",Jennifer Tejada,4392935
,,,,
17275,Question-and-Answer,"And then lastly, I will always say this every call, our customers count on us to be resilient at scale and if COVID's shown us nothing else, it's shown us that even when we saw significantly increased incidents more than 40% growth in incidents, 135% growth in events and API traffic this quarter, the platform continued to work and operate very, very well.",Jennifer Tejada,4392935
,,,,

,,,,
17277,Question-and-Answer,"Great. Just one quick follow-up. In this Cyber Monday, apparently, a lot of e-commerce companies had some very difficult time serving their customers and I was just curious if you've seen an uptick in inbounds as late as this week, as a result of some of these e-commerce companies struggling to keep up with some of their challenges that they had from an IT perspective?",Joel Fishbein,4392935
,,,,
17278,Question-and-Answer,"This is precisely why branding is so important for us and we did have a reasonably strong quarter in retail. I think I mentioned that in my comments, retail and e-commerce will continue to be a really important segment for us.",Jennifer Tejada,4392935
,,,,
17279,Question-and-Answer,"I would say this, I think that we're just seeing sort of scratching the surface now that everybody's ported their businesses into a digital environment; they now have to figure out how to operate them successfully. And it's a really in that journey for many of our customers, which is why we believe that we're going to continue to see momentum and long-term tailwinds, particularly as it relates to hardening up the operations behind digital acceleration, supporting our customers in cloud adoption and cloud migration, which you've seen continues to grow, and then DevOps transformation, which is still very early.",Jennifer Tejada,4392935

,,,,
17283,Question-and-Answer,"Hi, congrats on the quarter. Thanks for taking my questions. First one would be the excellent traction with partner ecosystem integrations, a number of companies Cloudflare, Freshworks. Symphony, are you seeing any particular areas that you have the most traction or that surprised you the most?",Kingsley Crane,4392935
,,,,
17284,Question-and-Answer,,Kingsley Crane,4392935
,,,,
17285,Question-and-Answer,"Some of the areas, we always look at our partner ecosystem to sort of see where the market is going and we've seen a lot of interest in security and customer service, which is why you see us investing in those areas. Automation continues to be, I think, a big opportunity.",Jennifer Tejada,4392935
,,,,
17286,Question-and-Answer,"But I think what you'll also see is that when you think about PagerDuty more generally as a platform that helps automate the detection of real-time unplanned unstructured work, and automate those workflows of getting that work to the right distributed team and making sure it gets resolved, so closing the loop, you start to see lots of new use cases where partners are discovering a PagerDuty integration can help them close the loop on either the analytics that they provide, or the services that they're trying to enable. And so I think we'll continue to see that as a trend. I'm really excited to see more and more partners building on PagerDuty.",Jennifer Tejada,4392935
,,,,
17287,Question-and-Answer,"That's really encouraging. And then one quick follow-up would be really encouraging to hear the strengths in the largest enterprises. In this segment, are you hearing anything new? Is it that when rates are improving against competitors, like Opsgenie? Or is it really just that these customers are recognizing the best-in-class ROI?",Kingsley Crane,4392935
,,,,
17288,Question-and-Answer,"Well, I'll remind me of a couple of things. One, most of our new lands are Greenfield, so we're often replacing manual behaviors, or spreadsheets, et cetera. So, again, still early, and a lot of customers are starting to accelerate their DevOps transformation, because their teams are now working remotely, their businesses are now digital.",Jennifer Tejada,4392935
,,,,
17289,Question-and-Answer,"We also don't see much competition from [Indiscernible] others in enterprise and more than 80% now, I think, of our users are enterprise users. So, that's been an area that we have talked about as a strategic focus for over the last two, three years. And it's nice to see that starting to manifest itself.",Jennifer Tejada,4392935
,,,,
17290,Question-and-Answer,"But I really do think that the leverage of our data, which is I think, a big differentiator over a decade of data on responders, workflows, events, and incidents themselves with AI and some of the solutions that we put out into the market over the last year or two has started to mature and gain traction and that's been a big part of it.",Jennifer Tejada,4392935
,,,,
17291,Question-and-Answer,"I would also tell you that a lot of these large enterprises, in that shift to digital are starting to add not just new products and services, but new teams. They bring their devs on first then maybe their IT operations teams, often security, we're increasingly seeing interest from customer service teams, and that's you starting to see PagerDuty leverage more and more across the organization.",Jennifer Tejada,4392935
,,,,
17292,Question-and-Answer,"Okay, perfect.",Kingsley Crane,4392935
,,,,
17293,Question-and-Answer,"And I think Jen, the one thing I would just add to that Kingsley, is that we've been remarkably consistent in terms of having our enterprise and mid-market customers expand with us. And again, this was another quarter where we saw roughly a third of them, expand with us, which is always good to see. But we have seen companies sort of getting back to pre-COVID type activity.",Howard Wilson,4392935
,,,,
17294,Question-and-Answer,"So, the sorts of projects that was associated with the things that Jen mentioned, like DevOps transformation or cloud migration, those projects are back on the table happening. And that's certainly proving to be a tailwind for us. And that's helping kind of sustain that 80% of our revenue coming from the enterprise, and mid-market segment.",Howard Wilson,4392935
,,,,
17295,Question-and-Answer,"Awesome. Thanks, guys. Congrats again.",Kingsley Crane,4392935
,,,,
17296,Question-and-Answer,Thank you.,Jennifer Tejada,4392935
,,,,
17297,Question-and-Answer,Thanks Kingsley.,Howard Wilson,4392935
,,,,
17298,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Rhys, you have the hand raised next, Rhys McDonald from Credit Suisse.",Operator,4392935
,,,,
17299,Question-and-Answer,"Great. Thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on a strong quarter. Jen, I noticed after your summit in September, the landing page of your website changed to include some solutions by industry. Should we think of those changes as more of a targeted form of marketing? Or are there broader changes on the horizon, either from a go-to-market perspective, or from a packaging perspective? How should we think about that?",Rhys McDonald,4392935
,,,,
17300,Question-and-Answer,,Rhys McDonald,4392935
,,,,
17301,Question-and-Answer,"Well, I appreciate you noticing that, I know the marketing team will be thrilled to hear that someone's actually looking and paying attention to what happens on the website. We definitely see some strength in certain verticals that tend to be digitizing faster, so to speak, seeing more of their business moving to digital apps. And we've talked in the past a lot about the tech and consumer internet, e-commerce, retail, financial services has been a really strong performing category for us.",Jennifer Tejada,4392935
,,,,
17302,Question-and-Answer,"And I think two things have really happened. One, customers are becoming more willing to talk about their stories and share what's working for them and we really want to open source some of their learnings so that our other customers can move faster and that's a big part of what we do from a customer marketing perspective.",Jennifer Tejada,4392935
,,,,
17303,Question-and-Answer,"But also, I think there are so many different ways that you can apply PagerDuty helping some of these vertical industries understand the sort of natural places to start, where do I kick-off my use case makes a lot of sense. But we haven't had verticalized the product and I think this is a really important differentiator for PagerDuty. It's very easy to use, it's very easy to deploy, you can be up and running in five or 10 minutes on PagerDuty, start to add teams, et cetera. So, it doesn't require us to have to verticalized or package the product.",Jennifer Tejada,4392935
,,,,
17304,Question-and-Answer,"But I think getting the word out on how customers are leveraging PagerDuty and really importantly, and you heard me talk about the IDC research today, like the kinds of ROI our customer is seeing, I will tell you that increasingly, our large customers are growing tired of having to pay huge multi-year licensing fees and wait three to four years to get ROI.",Jennifer Tejada,4392935
,,,,
17305,Question-and-Answer,"And we talk about an enterprise a two month payback with an ROI of over 800%. And I think if you're someone championing a new SaaS solution in your organization, being able to quantify that kind of return is really helpful.",Jennifer Tejada,4392935
,,,,
17306,Question-and-Answer,"It makes a ton of sense and I appreciate the color. And maybe if I could Howard, one for you just a little bit of housecleaning, if I could around the acquisition. Could you comment on how many of your customer ads in the quarter came from Rundeck? And to the extent that there was significant overlap, could you comment on whether or not there was ARR contribution in your expansion rate this quarter?",Rhys McDonald,4392935
,,,,
17307,Question-and-Answer,"So, thanks, Rhys. So, obviously, we closed the Rundeck acquisition in October, right. So, its contribution to the quarter was relatively small and not really material. In terms of the customers that they brought along, we did share details around, they have a relatively small customer base, it's an early company. So, again, not a material number of ads.",Howard Wilson,4392935
,,,,
17308,Question-and-Answer,"They certainly delivered a positive contribution to our overall ARR, but we don't disclose ARR specifically. But there have been -- certainly there's a positive impact with it.",Howard Wilson,4392935
,,,,
17309,Question-and-Answer,"And I think the piece that I'm most excited about is that it's such a logical combination that when I have discussions with customers' accounts where I'm an executive sponsor, they feel really positive about how this is actually going to help them sort of close the loop from detect to remediate by having PagerDuty and Rundeck as part of a one family.",Howard Wilson,4392935
,,,,
17310,Question-and-Answer,Makes sense. Thanks again for taking the questions. I appreciate it.,Rhys McDonald,4392935
,,,,
17311,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you, Rhys.",Howard Wilson,4392935
,,,,
17312,Question-and-Answer,"Great, thank you, Rhys. Next we'd like to go to Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Sterling?",Operator,4392935
,,,,
17313,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, thanks. Hi, guys. Howard, maybe just to follow-up and put a fine point on it, I didn't quite catch in terms of the Rundeck acquisition, what would be the revenue contribution that you would expect in the fourth quarter because people want to understand how it impacted guidance?",Sterling Auty,4392935
,,,,
17314,Question-and-Answer,,Sterling Auty,4392935
,,,,
17315,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, so we haven't provided a breakdown of Rundeck in terms of what the specific revenue contribution would be. What we did say at the time of doing the acquisition that we saw this as being a company on an annual basis that would have revenue within the high single-digits, so that's kind of the extent to which we disclose on that. And you'll see when I think you can talk; we have spoken about the opening deferred revenue balance of $2.7 million that came across from Rundeck.",Howard Wilson,4392935
,,,,
17316,Question-and-Answer,"All right. I just want to make sure, so if you think about organically where the guidance is for next quarter, would you say that you've guided up organically and then added Rundeck? Or was there some --",Sterling Auty,4392935
,,,,
17317,Question-and-Answer,It was a combination. It was a combination of improved performance of PagerDuty and the addition of Rundeck.,Howard Wilson,4392935
,,,,
17318,Question-and-Answer,"All right, perfect. And if I could sneak one last one in Jennifer for you, the comment about 80% of the customers being enterprise, I think that's very helpful. Would you say then given the increase in net dollar retention that the headwinds from SMB are now behind you? And that's going to lead to the acceleration?",Sterling Auty,4392935
,,,,
17319,Question-and-Answer,"I think we won 80% of our users come from enterprise, so just wanted--",Jennifer Tejada,4392935
,,,,
17320,Question-and-Answer,80% of our revenue.,Howard Wilson,4392935
,,,,
17321,Question-and-Answer,"80% of our revenue, sorry, its good thing I bring Howard with me everywhere. But I want to point to the strength in enterprise expansion; our enterprise net dollar base retention is up over 120%. So, we definitely are seeing that strength in expansion.",Jennifer Tejada,4392935
,,,,
17322,Question-and-Answer,Great. Thank you.,Sterling Auty,4392935
,,,,
17323,Question-and-Answer,"Okay, next, we have a hand up from Matt Stotler. Matt, I'm sorry, I don't have your organization if you could let those of us that don't know; know where you're calling from?",Operator,4392935
,,,,
17324,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. Hey, Jenny Howard. Thank you for taking the question. Matt Stotler, William Blair. I guess first to start-off, you guys have highlighted some, I guess use case specific solutions recently, including your customer service, cloud operations, business response. Obviously, some of these are still relatively early innings. But we'd love to maybe get some thoughts on your early interest from customers and how meaningful you think these could be over time?",Matt Stotler,4392935
,,,,
17325,Question-and-Answer,"Well, as I mentioned earlier, Matt, and thank you for the question. We have been really excited about how customers are receiving some of our new products and services. But they all come from us hearing from customers, these are problems that they don't have solutions for yet. So, we don't build something unless customers are already signaling reasonable demand and the uptake of these new solutions that we've talked about in the last year that you mentioned, has exceeded our expectations.",Jennifer Tejada,4392935
,,,,
17326,Question-and-Answer,"I would tell you that when you think about everything that's out there in the industry, it's often been hard for us to explain to the market, how we're different because there's this kaleidoscope of monitoring and observability providers, their ticketing systems, et cetera. And I think as we start to build out these use cases, it becomes much more clear how customers can leverage us in a different way.",Jennifer Tejada,4392935
,,,,
17327,Question-and-Answer,"I think with COVID, because everybody is working and living and learning from home, the concept that time really matters, has also really helped to create more awareness and understanding around what we do in terms of not just detecting an issue, but orchestrating and automating the workflow to get that issue to the right team at the right point in time, automating more and more of the diagnosis around that and with Rundeck, effectively starting to drive some safe self-healing and auto remediation within those incidents or issues and things are popping up that you don't plan for all across the business, not just driven by technology problems within the dev team and that's where we're seeing some of that use case expansion.",Jennifer Tejada,4392935
,,,,
17328,Question-and-Answer,,Jennifer Tejada,4392935
,,,,
17329,Question-and-Answer,"Right. Right, that's helpful. And then just a quick follow-up, you get some commentary around the new pricing model, obviously sounds like the early response to the freemium structure has been positive.",Matt Stotler,4392935
,,,,
17330,Question-and-Answer,"Can you talk about kind of looking forward any mechanisms that you have in place to start converting those freemium customers, or how you think about kind of making those, those free users into paying customers?",Matt Stotler,4392935
,,,,
17331,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, so we're lucky that we have a hybrid go-to-market motion. So, for us that starts with product-led growth and my teams are so sick of hearing me talk about this, but the product has to be so easy to use and work so well that it helps customers and users discover more functionality and more features.",Jennifer Tejada,4392935
,,,,
17332,Question-and-Answer,"And so freemium is intended to help customers sample what our platform can do, but then the product should allow them with -- to expand with things like the 500 integrations or adding more teams are starting to identify new use cases.",Jennifer Tejada,4392935
,,,,
17333,Question-and-Answer,"And equally we have, I think, a really well performing sales organization, including our commercial teams that are focused on our mid-market customers and our enterprise team, obviously, focused on enterprise that really do everything they can to not annoy a user who's finding their own way through the product just fine, but really support large strategic initiatives that where customers are really trying to transform.",Jennifer Tejada,4392935
,,,,
17334,Question-and-Answer,"And one of the things we noticed in the last quarter, particularly in even mid-market was that customers are having more strategic conversations with us around transformative efforts where they're really trying to change how they work, where they're trying to accelerate their way to the future of work, which is a lot more automated than it has been in the past, and where they really understand kind of the need to improve their operational performance to support these customer experiences that are now primarily happening in a digital environment.",Jennifer Tejada,4392935
,,,,
17335,Question-and-Answer,"And maybe I can just add to that, Jen, when we look at the -- it's still early days for us with this free plan, but we've seen really good conversion rates so far. We haven't -- we don?t disclose them, but they've been better than expected and better than what we have heard reported in the industry. So, it's looking strong.",Howard Wilson,4392935
,,,,
17336,Question-and-Answer,Great. Thanks again.,Matt Stotler,4392935
,,,,
17337,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you. Next, we'd like to hear from Sanjit Singh from Morgan Stanley. Sanjit, please go ahead.",Operator,4392935
,,,,
17338,Question-and-Answer,Excellent. Thank you for taking the question. This was actually Keith Weiss sitting in for Sanjit if you didn't noticed.,Keith Weiss,4392935
,,,,
17339,Question-and-Answer,"Not only does Sanjit looks different, but Keith looks different.",Jennifer Tejada,4392935
,,,,
17340,Question-and-Answer,"You know what I actually I dressed up as Howard Wilson for Halloween. So, I want to ask about digital operations plan, you guys saw really good uptake of that year-on-year nice uptake in terms of the amount of net new ACV coming from that plan? Can you talk to us a little bit about what that does to the initial deal sizes, kind of how's that impacting your landings, if you will, with these new customers?",Keith Weiss,4392935
,,,,
17341,Question-and-Answer,"Howard, you want to take that?",Jennifer Tejada,4392935
,,,,
17342,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, sure. So, I think there are a couple of things Keith on that one. One is that often for our customers; they could still land in one of our other plants, like our professional or in our business plan. So, sometimes we do see customers land in those plants and then upgrade to digital operations as part of a natural migration as they mature.",Howard Wilson,4392935
,,,,
17343,Question-and-Answer,"What is exciting though is that our digital operations plan includes our most advanced functionality and capabilities and that's what really sets us apart from the competition. It widens the moat between us and any of the other players. So, it gives companies to take advantage of features that allow them to be more predictive, more proactive in terms of how they manage their environments, and it allows them to leverage machine learning to be able to solve problems much faster.",Howard Wilson,4392935
,,,,
17344,Question-and-Answer,,Howard Wilson,4392935
,,,,
17345,Question-and-Answer,"Our recommendations engine within that is really powerful, ability to help them get a view on what's happening in terms of change and service dependencies in the environment. All of those features are unique and special and so I think that's driving the interest and the growth in digital operations plan because there isn't anything else like us.",Howard Wilson,4392935
,,,,
17346,Question-and-Answer,"And in terms of the land, most of our customers still land on a relatively simple, product and proposition, and it's usually still a developer that wants to manage new service, or is moving a payload to the cloud or is part of a transformation initiative.",Howard Wilson,4392935
,,,,
17347,Question-and-Answer,"One of the nice things about the Rundeck acquisition is it gives us a new and a secondary land motion, you don't have to come in through the PagerDuty product only, you can come in through Rundeck. So, we're excited about that land opportunity as well.",Howard Wilson,4392935
,,,,
17348,Question-and-Answer,"And you'll continue to see us focus on keeping the product easy to use and easy to understand, even as we add new features and lots of new technology to the product. I think customers are starting to really appreciate the leverage on the data in the platform and how it can really shift them quickly from being reactive to proactive. And we've seen that in both some of the larger strategic deals we've done this quarter, but you'll also see it and how some of our customers -- you'll hear us repeat the same names expanding quarter-after-quarter-after-quarter. And that's where we know we've really caught a customer that needs are supported in transformation.",Howard Wilson,4392935
,,,,
17349,Question-and-Answer,"Got it. Got it. And then drilling down specifically on the Event Intelligence product, how's that that uptake going, are you seeing good traction with that?",Keith Weiss,4392935
,,,,
17350,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, I think so. I?ll let Howard speak to that specifically.",Jennifer Tejada,4392935
,,,,
17351,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, so some of our customers up to take business plan or professional plan with Event Intelligence as an add on, and that again, we're continuing to see good momentum and better Event Intelligence is also included in our digital operations plan and that's part of the attraction there.",Howard Wilson,4392935
,,,,
17352,Question-and-Answer,"The Event Intelligence uptake has been driven largely by people wanting to be able to get to a problem faster and being able to reduce the noise, because our customers all have this huge array of monitoring tools in their environment, as Jen called it a kaleidoscope of monitoring applications around them. And so to be able to filter in or get that that noise down is really critical and getting the right person on to the right problem and that's what Event Intelligence enables. So, we're seeing good momentum with that product.",Howard Wilson,4392935
,,,,
17353,Question-and-Answer,"Got it. And then if I can just sneak one last one. Any update in terms of the traction outside of the core kind of IT operations use case? We talked way back when about so the potential sort of broader use cases for PagerDuty, any update on sort of the incremental fashion you guys have been seeing with it?",Keith Weiss,4392935
,,,,
17354,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, so we have -- I mean, qualitatively, we continue to see good momentum and good growth in the security SecOps type environments and in the customer service environments, which lead to us creating the customer service SKU if you like. We haven't actually got any figures that we reporting on within this particular season, but we'll save it for an Analyst Day. We can give people diagnostic on that.",Howard Wilson,4392935
,,,,
17355,Question-and-Answer,"That's a good little teaser. Thank you very much, guys.",Keith Weiss,4392935
,,,,
17356,Question-and-Answer,Thank you.,Jennifer Tejada,4392935
,,,,
17357,Question-and-Answer,"Thanks for the fun there. And Matt we want to go to you next Matt, Matthew Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets.",Operator,4392935
,,,,
17358,Question-and-Answer,"Hi guys, thanks for taking my questions. Jen, obviously, hearing you talk about an inflection point and confidence in momentum continue is really great to hear. It seems to me like it's a combination of just perhaps better buying, but also better execution.",Matthew Hedberg,4392935
,,,,
17359,Question-and-Answer,,Matthew Hedberg,4392935
,,,,
17360,Question-and-Answer,"And I know Dave has been there now for a while, could you could you talk about the specifics on like, what you can control versus the environment, because it almost feels to me like you feel better about both aspects, but even if COVID cases spike, your ability to execute seems higher as well. I'm just sort of curious on Dave's contributions thus far.",Matthew Hedberg,4392935
,,,,
17361,Question-and-Answer,"Sure. Well, that's absolutely right. Even as COVID cases spike and we obviously can't predict the macro environment, I think both our customers and we are better prepared for sort of whatever comes. And I have to hand it to Dave and the entire go-to-market team, including customer success, who really led with empathy, and trying to understand what customers are going through because all of our customers are experiencing this a little differently. We still have cruise lines and airlines in our business base; we also have companies that are up 300%, 400% as a result of being COVID benefactors.",Jennifer Tejada,4392935
,,,,
17362,Question-and-Answer,"And when you look at the diversity of all of that, it really means that our teams have to be really dialed-in to what customers are prioritizing and what they care about. And I think Dave has not only hired well, and up-levelled some of our leadership across our sales teams, he supported some of our talent that was here before, he's brought in folks like [Indiscernible], who are really up levelling our customer service.",Jennifer Tejada,4392935
,,,,
17363,Question-and-Answer,"And he often talks about this, it sounds very boring, but just being rigorous in the hygiene of managing the operations of day to day sales is really important and so forecast accuracy has improved.",Jennifer Tejada,4392935
,,,,
17364,Question-and-Answer,"And then finally, I would say, Dave, and the team are really prioritizing a focus on value on helping our customers really understand that quantifiable ROI, we often for customers, build them a business value assessment. And then we go back and we look at how are we delivering on that business value assessment.",Jennifer Tejada,4392935
,,,,
17365,Question-and-Answer,"And so when you think about the sort of contradiction that our customers are in, where they're trying to expand their digital offering, and grow their revenue, in this environment, and at the same time, reduce their cost pace and become more efficient. Those two things can really be in conflict with one another. PagerDuty helps you with both.",Jennifer Tejada,4392935
,,,,
17366,Question-and-Answer,"And it's been important for our teams to work hard to help our customers understand that. But I'm really pleased with how the teams go. I mean equally I would say, that product organization delivered a lot of innovation at summit that was really received by our customers and the balance of our organization, I think you'd be lying if you didn't say people are fatigued by shutdowns and by not being able to go into the office and collaborate et cetera. And our teams is really continued to grind and show a lot of grit in putting us in a better position going forward.",Jennifer Tejada,4392935
,,,,
17367,Question-and-Answer,"So, I am a lot more confident in our execution, but also like what I'm seeing in pipeline in just the kinds of conversations we're having with customers and how they're sort of settling into their own new normal and focusing on some of those strategic transformative opportunities as well.",Jennifer Tejada,4392935
,,,,
17368,Question-and-Answer,"That is really, really great to hear. And then I guess on the -- on your last call, 2Q call, did you close one of your largest enterprise deals ever in August? You maybe you addressed it in the in the prepared remarks, I wasn't quite certain if you hit on that particular customer if you did, or maybe if you didn't, could you maybe shine a little bit more light on that use case. And I don't know if there's any way to scope out what sort of magnitude of a deal that might be-- because it?s certainly a great data point.",Matthew Hedberg,4392935
,,,,
17369,Question-and-Answer,"What I would say is I was really excited to see customers spending over a million dollars with us grew by 33% in the quarter, I think that's a strong number of customers that are spending over $500,000 with us grew by 40%.",Jennifer Tejada,4392935
,,,,
17370,Question-and-Answer,,Jennifer Tejada,4392935
,,,,
17371,Question-and-Answer,"That particular deal that you're referring to was a large land with a large mortgage provider and a really good example of an organization that already had a reasonably significant digital business, but is now kind of all in on digital and seeing, an opportunity in the market is a lot of people are moving around and changing, their lifestyles and the buying houses with yards or second houses or getting out of suburban -- getting into suburban areas and out of out of urban areas. And so for that particular customer, it was all about transforming quickly, right, like making sure that their operations could support their digital acceleration.",Jennifer Tejada,4392935
,,,,
17372,Question-and-Answer,"The -- we talked a little bit about the Salesforce relationship that we have, which is a multi-year agreement and I was really excited to see Salesforce about the digital operations plan and look to continue rolling that out across their business. And again, similar link, right, really focused on customer experience, and want to ensure that PagerDuty can help teams across the business, get to issues faster and manage them before they become incidents that impact customers in the business and really just shift to being more proactive operationally.",Jennifer Tejada,4392935

,,,,
17374,Question-and-Answer,Thank you.,Jennifer Tejada,4392935
,,,,
17375,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you. We do have one more hand up so far; feel free to raise your hand if you have any other inquiries. Hannah Rudoff with D.A. Davidson. Hannah, please go ahead.",Operator,4392935
,,,,
17376,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. Hi, all. Thanks for taking my questions today. It's great to see the solid business momentum this quarter. First question, it's been a few months since your Virtual EMEA Summit; I was wondering if you could talk about how pipeline conversion following the summit has been? And then how pipeline build following your North American Summit was?",Hannah Rudoff,4392935
,,,,
17377,Question-and-Answer,"Sure, I think we're pleased with pipeline off the back of both of those summits and in fact, because our global summit in September was virtual, that meant we also had a lot of European customers that had joined the EMEA Summit, but also came on to learn more about our new products and services. So, we're excited about the interest that we're seeing across -- really across the product and platform set, particular interest around Rundeck in automation, and just this continued move to reducing toil for the humans in support of getting them to the purposeful, mission-driven work they care about.",Jennifer Tejada,4392935
,,,,
17378,Question-and-Answer,"I'm spending quite a bit of time with customers next week, 'in Europe' via my camera, and really looking forward to talking about some of the customers in Europe that are driving transformations. One in particular, is a large telecommunications organization that has gone through a massive agile transformation. And their CEO is actually joining me to talk about how PagerDuty supported them in their agile transformation.",Jennifer Tejada,4392935
,,,,
17379,Question-and-Answer,"And that's a use case that we're seeing frequently where top down non-technical, but general, like business leadership is saying we have to become more agile, we have to become a tech company. And suddenly, a product like PagerDuty is on their radar.",Jennifer Tejada,4392935
,,,,
17380,Question-and-Answer,"Great, it's really good to hear. And then on Rundeck, how much integration is there left to do? And what's kind of the timeline for that?",Hannah Rudoff,4392935
,,,,
17381,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, well, the first thing I would say is, that was our first real acquisitions since we've been a public company and not only did we get it done quickly during an environment where we couldn't get out and even see their office, we closed that deal and still executed well in the quarter and the integration is actually going very well. We're trying to make sure that we give Rundeck enough room to continue to operate like a startup and innovate quickly and continue to build out their product, but get the benefit of our distribution environment. And a lot of the folks on the finance team that have helped to prepare for earnings this week have also really helped to integrate Rundeck. And so it's not -- it's tracking very well.",Jennifer Tejada,4392935

17383,Question-and-Answer,Great. Thank you.,Hannah Rudoff,4392935
,,,,
17384,Question-and-Answer,"Well, folks, it looks like that's all the questions that we have from our group today. Howard, Jennifer, I'd like to give you both an opportunity to provide any final comments to our audience today before we wrap up.",Operator,4392935
,,,,
17385,Question-and-Answer,"I just wanted to say thank you, especially to our analysts, many of you have given us a lot of feedback, which we've asked for and continue to really appreciate to try and tighten up how we how we help people understand our journey and where we're going as a company. So, thank you so much for that and to all of our customers. We really appreciate the trust that you put in us and are going to continue to focus on earning that every day. And I hope all of you continue to remain safe and well and keep your masks on until the next time we see you. Thank you.",Jennifer Tejada,4392935

17392,Presentation,"Thanks, Pete. Our press release was issued after the market close and is posted on the Investor Relations section of our website, where this call is also being webcast. Statements made on this call include forward-looking statements related to our business under federal securities laws, including statements about financial projections, the plans and expectations for our go-to-market strategy, our expectations for our sales and new business initiatives, the impact of COVID-19 on our business and our financial conditions.",Julie Kehoe,4392932

17393,Presentation,"These statements are subject to a variety of risks, uncertainties and assumptions.

,,,,
17396,Presentation,"Thank you, Julie. Hello, everyone. Thanks for joining the call. First, I hope that everyone is in good health. As we all know this year has presented unimaginable health and economic challenges across the globe, and we indeed hope this pandemic is a once in a lifetime event.",Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17397,Presentation,"On the call today, I'm going to focus on a few items. First, a huge financial milestone that we've been working for years and the implications for our recent success, increased financial flexibility and our plans to drive efficient revenue growth. Second, our Domo's differentiated platform uniquely positions us to help our customers with their digital transformation initiatives. And third, I'll cover Q3 highlights, including several significant upsells and wins across a variety of industries. And I'll touch on some recent industry recognition.",Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17398,Presentation,,Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17399,Presentation,"So I'm going to start with sharing how ecstatic I am that we achieved a significant milestone. As of Q3, Domo was a recurring revenue cash flow positive company that has happy customers with gross retention north of 90% and has growing subscription revenue north of 20% with a total annualized revenue run rate of over $200 million. This is the culmination of over a thousand people, including several hundred that are here today, and we have been working on this for over 10 years. This is the culmination of listening to customers and building what they need. This is the culmination of putting our hearts and souls into our customers and our vision, and we are only just getting started.",Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17400,Presentation,"We are the only publicly traded independent cloud-based BI company, and we have countless opportunities in front of us. So a huge thank you to our customers and a huge thank you to our team members, my partners and our investors who have always believed in us.",Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17401,Presentation,"Now we are going to return that belief with greatness. Not many, if any believed we would get to cash flow positive this fast after our IPO two years ago. I put it on the calendar for Q3 fiscal year 2021, and I adamantly believe we would make it one way or another, and despite ups and downs in pandemics, earthquakes, unrest, political upheaval, cuts and losses, great people and wonderful innovative customers banded together to create what is now a world-class organization.",Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17402,Presentation,"I recently put up a billboard that says simply, there's a pony in there somewhere. The reference is from President Ronald Reagan. He often told the story. The story concerns twin boys of five or six. Worried that the boys had developed extreme personalities, one was a total pessimist, the other a total optimist, their parents took them to a psychiatrist.",Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17403,Presentation,"Well, first the psychiatrist treated the pessimist. Trying to brighten his outlook, the psychiatrist took him to a room piled to the ceiling with brand-new toys. But instead of yelping with delight, the little boy burst into tears. 'What's the matter?' the psychiatrist asked, baffled. 'Don't you want to play with any of the toys?' 'Yes, the little boy bawled, but if I did I'd only break them.",Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17404,Presentation,"Next the psychiatrist treated the optimist. Trying to dampen his outlook, the psychiatrist took him to a room piled to the ceiling with horse manure. But instead of wrinkling his nose in disgust, the optimist emitted just the yelp of delight and clambered to the top of the pile, dropped to his knees, and began gleefully digging out scoop after scoop with his bare hands. 'What do you think you're doing?' the psychiatrist asked, just as baffled by the optimist as he had been by the pessimist. 'With all this manure,' the little boy replied, beaming, 'there must be a pony in here somewhere!'",Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17405,Presentation,"Well, I think President Ronald Reagan certainly could have been referring to eternal, but hopefully measured optimism for entrepreneurs. And so for good luck, I put up that billboard at the beginning of this quarter, that repeated that phrase, there's a pony in there somewhere.",Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17406,Presentation,"We've been through our shares of ups and downs, but I was always 100% convinced. This would eventually turn into a fantastic, even world-class company. Maybe it's my entrepreneurial optimism shining through, but we found the pony, a big recurring revenue, fast growing cash flow positive company with all kinds of happy customers, innovations and market positions to go out and capitalize on.",Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17407,Presentation,"Since our IPO, we've been committed to getting to adjust our cash flow positive with the cash on our balance sheet without raising a dime. And I'm thrilled to announce today that in Q3 we achieved it. And in fact, we achieved it with $84 million remaining in the bank substantially more than anyone imagined.",Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17408,Presentation,,Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17409,Presentation,"In Q3, we posted 25% billings growth, an acceleration from 23% last quarter. The continued growth in our base of recurring revenue and reaching a cash flow positive status gives us increased financial flexibility to pursue the tremendous growth opportunity in front of us.",Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17410,Presentation,"Now, let me talk a little bit about our unique positioning and helping our customers with their digital transformation initiatives. As we all know, what has happened this year has forced companies, their employees, customers, and supply chains to re-imagine how they operate. The need for real-time information, speed and business agility that digital transformation provides has only accelerated. These elements have always been crucial another reason we found at the company. But in this climate, these business priorities have moved to the forefront. Our customers have challenged us to solve their business problems with data at an unprecedented speed and we have delivered for them.",Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17411,Presentation,"Domo's unique platform has three pillars that drive our differentiation. The first is our data integration capabilities to solve back-end integration at cloud scale without moving data. Second is our ability to drive insights and action with AI into well-governed business intelligence power into the hands of business users in an easy-to-use self-service and mobile-first solution. Third is the ability to build data-driven apps in a low-code, no-code way that can modernize business processes at high speed and extend the value of data analytics and insights outside the organization to customers and partners.",Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17412,Presentation,"Our platforms ability to solve at scale and in record time, the back-end and front-end challenges to make data more valuable internally and externally for customers is a huge key to our differentiation. Our most significant wins this quarter were driven by proof-of-concepts, POCs, where we were able to demonstrate our ability to deliver better solutions faster than the competition.",Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17413,Presentation,"The reason we can compose solutions so quickly is part of the inherent flexibility and scalability of the Domo cloud first platform, which brings all the services needed, integration, data management, data science, AI, and machine learning, governance, distribution to citizen, developers and more to the data and apps. Through intelligent analytics-based applications built on the Domo platform in a low-code, no-code environment, we are helping customers to rapidly modernize business processes, leveraging artificial intelligence and automating workflows.",Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17414,Presentation,"Our platform through our Domo Everywhere offering also goes beyond traditional embedded analytics capabilities and enables customers to extend their analytics and the value of their data to external stakeholders, such as customers and supply chain partners, while also generating new revenue models.",Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17415,Presentation,"I'll share a couple examples of this in just a few minutes. Our view is that the demand for speed, business agility and real-time analytics is not something that goes away after the pandemic, and we will continue to deliver this to our customers. Now, let me discuss how we are thinking about our increased financial flexibility and our plans to drive efficient growth.",Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17416,Presentation,"I am particularly proud of how our employees have delivered during the pandemic. I would point out that our recent performance occurred against the backdrop of pretty significant cost reduction this year in a severe economic downturn. Our employee headcount in Q3 was down year-over-year, and we've continued to grow our recurring revenue with [indiscernible] expenses.",Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17417,Presentation,"We have also been relentlessly focused on customer success, which is reflected in our higher retention rates. Going forward, we plan to invest in client services and other areas of our business that directly support our ability to serve and grow existing accounts.",Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17418,Presentation,,Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17419,Presentation,"So now let me talk about some of the business highlights in Q3. One highlight was the seven-figure annual upsell I mentioned on last quarter's call with the Fortune Global 500 retail conglomerate. We won this deal based on our outperformance and speed and scale compared to the competition. Domo was chosen to help the organization, integrate massive volumes of data from its existing systems without replacing or rearchitecting them, so business decision makers could understand critical time-sensitive business metrics.",Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17420,Presentation,"One of the key factors in our selection was not just Domo?s ability to access and integrate data, but our ability to provide data governance at scale and do so without adding burden to already strained IT teams. Like most large organizations, this customer has multiple related technologies in use, but none were built to perform at cloud scale and in record time, like Domo.",Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17421,Presentation,"Another highlight in the U.S. federal space where we leverage a partner relationship to close and almost seven-figure annual new-logo contract to power PRAC, a public-facing website that gives taxpayers the ability to see and explore pandemic relief spending data. Several of our largest banks in this quarter demonstrate the success of customers having with Domo and how we can grow with the success.",Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17422,Presentation,"For example, we closed a seven-figure upsell with technology and media conglomerate that is using our Domo Everywhere solution to extend the value of its analytics and data and the full power of Domo externally to its community of tens of thousands of partners. We were initially chosen based on our superior speed and scale. This significant expansion was based on the successful rollout to a subset of the company's massive partner network.",Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17423,Presentation,"We also signed a large upsell deal for Domo Everywhere that gives the learning management system, or LMS software company, the ability to embed and monetize LMS analytics into a software solution for its growing customer base. Before the initial contract, this customer had evaluated numerous solutions and also built a homegrown option that just didn't completely fit their vision. After POC, the customer selected Domo because it was the only solution that allowed the company to extend the interactive analytics and data experience it want for your customers at scale.",Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17424,Presentation,"The most recent expansion was driven by the demand the company has seen across the rest of its customer base for its Domo powered analytics, which the company has also turned into a new revenue stream.",Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17425,Presentation,"Now let me talk about some recent industry recognition. Our team continues to receive accolades that reflect our commitment to product innovation, customer success, and our corporate culture. Most recently, Domo with our customer Unilever was named a winner in Ventana Research's Digital Leadership Awards for the support that data and the Domo platform played in Unilever's national philanthropic initiative United for America, which provided them with $25 million worth of support to local communities. In addition, Domo was named an overall experience and credibility leader in the Dresner Advisory Services? 2020 SME BI study. And lastly, Domo was named for the ninth year in a row as a Utah Business best company to work for.",Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17426,Presentation,"In closing, I continue to be impressed by the work our team is doing to help customers thrive, and I am impressed by our employees? performance in this environment. It?s extremely rewarding as well to know we achieved our quarterly results while also hitting the significant milestone of getting the cash flow positive in the quarter with plenty of cash in the bank. And I'm looking forward to continuing to execute on our tremendous growth opportunity. And I sincerely thank our employees for their commitment and I'm so excited to take a moment and celebrate this milestone with them. I am so incredibly proud of all that they've accomplished.",Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17427,Presentation,,Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17428,Presentation,"And with that, I will turn it over to Bruce. Bruce?",Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17429,Presentation,"Thank you, Josh. We had a strong Q3 and at the same time, we had several important milestones this quarter. As Josh mentioned, we met our commitments to reach positive operating cash flow without the need to raise additional capital. In fact, we reached this milestone with $84 million in the bank, substantially ahead of our plans at the IPO, and we intend to stay operating cash flow positive going forward.",Bruce Felt,4392932
,,,,
17430,Presentation,"Another milestone is that our gross retention rate increased to over 90% and represents a record high. If the milestone is record subscription gross margins at 81%, an important metric in driving long-term profitability. These achievements are result of many incremental internal improvements we have made across the business enhanced by the market shifting towards solutions such as ours that provide modern ways to create, distribute and use data to run businesses.",Bruce Felt,4392932
,,,,
17431,Presentation,"I will now review the details behind our performance and then discuss fourth quarter and fiscal 2021 full-year guidance. Our Q3 billings of $55.7 million, a year-over-year increase of more than 25% was driven by strong new customer count growth, upsells and expansions and high retention rates. We delivered these results overcoming a tough year-over-year large scale comparison by generating a much higher volume of transactions than one-year ago.",Bruce Felt,4392932
,,,,
17432,Presentation,"At the same time, we've maintained our standard billing terms even against the backdrop of pandemic-driven challenges in seven segments of our customer base. We have 59% of our customers under multi-year contracts at the end of Q3. Our remaining performance obligations, or RPO grew 21% compared to the same quarter last year. Current RPO or RPO expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months, grew 22% year-over-year.",Bruce Felt,4392932
,,,,
17433,Presentation,"Q3 total revenue was $53.6 million, a year-over-year increase of 20%. Subscription revenue grew 24% year-over-year and represented 87% of total revenue. International revenue in the quarter represented 24% of total revenue consistent with Q2. Our subscription gross margin was 81% up more than 4 percentage points from 76% in Q3 of last year and a slight improvement from last quarter. We continue to be successful managing our data center costs even as volumes continue to increase.",Bruce Felt,4392932
,,,,
17434,Presentation,"In Q3, operating expenses decreased by 6% from last year, even though revenue increased by 20%. The net effect of increased revenue while being cost efficient, improved our operating margin by 31 percentage points from the same quarter last year.",Bruce Felt,4392932
,,,,
17435,Presentation,"Now let me comment briefly on our investment and margin approach going forward. Now we have hit the milestone of becoming adjusted cash flow positive, we plan to continue to generate positive operating cash flow. At the same time, since we have cushion on the balance sheet and have demonstrated leverage in the business, we believe we can safely take some of that leverage and invest more in growth than we have over the last two years.",Bruce Felt,4392932
,,,,
17436,Presentation,We are already building our salesforce capacity and plan to make additional investments in some new product areas in order to support our growth plans. We can make these investments continue to expand margins. Although we expect margin improvement to occur at a lesser rate that we have demonstrated recently as we sought to achieve cash flow profitability. We will provide specific guidance and more color around these things when we announce our Q4 results.,Bruce Felt,4392932
,,,,
17437,Presentation,"Our net loss was $11.9 million and our net loss per share was $0.40. This is based on 29.5 million weighted-average shares outstanding, basic and diluted. In Q3, we reported adjusted cash flow from operations of $1.4 million, an improvement of $6.2 million over last quarter.",Bruce Felt,4392932
,,,,
17438,Presentation,Adjusted cash flow from operations excludes 3.1 million of share purchases in Q3 under our employee stock purchase plan. The amount is included as a positive amount in our GAAP cash flow from financing section of our cash flow statement and an offsetting negative amount in our GAAP cash flow from operations section with no effect on our cash balance.,Bruce Felt,4392932
,,,,
17439,Presentation,,Bruce Felt,4392932
,,,,
17440,Presentation,"Turning now to our balance sheet. As of October 31, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $84 million. Now to discuss what we expect in Q4 and the full fiscal year of 2021. For Q4, we are expecting billings of about $72 million as we are experiencing strength in our business and have good visibility as we head into the remainder of Q4.",Bruce Felt,4392932
,,,,
17441,Presentation,"For the current fiscal year, we now expect billings of about $222 million, up from $208 million that we guided to last quarter and well above our initial outlook of $190 million based on our COVID-19 downside case that we use for reducing costs.",Bruce Felt,4392932
,,,,
17442,Presentation,"On expenses, we are planning on our Q4 operating expenses to increase modestly from Q3 levels. While we expect to see decrease in operating expenses in fiscal year 2021, we expect them to increase in fiscal year 2022. We expect Q4 adjusted net cash provided by operations of approximately $1.5 million and expect full-year adjusted net cash used in operations of approximately $11 million.",Bruce Felt,4392932
,,,,
17443,Presentation,"Now to formal guidance. For the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, we expect GAAP revenue to be in the range of $53.3 million to $54.3 million. We expect non-GAAP net loss per share, basic and diluted of $0.42 to $0.46. This assumes 30.1 million weighted average shares outstanding, basic and diluted.",Bruce Felt,4392932
,,,,
17444,Presentation,"For the full-year of fiscal 2021, we expect GAAP revenue to be in the range of $206.6 million to $207.6 million, representing year-over-year growth of 19% to 20%. We expect non-GAAP net loss per share, basic and diluted of $1.83 to $1.87. This assumes 29.3 million weighted average shares outstanding, basic and diluted.",Bruce Felt,4392932
,,,,
17445,Presentation,"In closing, we are pleased with our execution in Q3 and are optimistic about our financial position and growth opportunities as we close out fiscal year 2021 and head into next year.",Bruce Felt,4392932
,,,,
17446,Presentation,"With that, we'll open up the call for questions. Operator?",Bruce Felt,4392932
,,,,
17447,Question-and-Answer,[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Sanjit Singh from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.,Operator,4392932
,,,,
17448,Question-and-Answer,"Hi. Thank you for taking the questions. Congrats to you both on the cash flow positive. It was a long road, I mean, you got there and now it?s a quite an achievement. In terms of thinking about the quarter, the 20% billings growth against the tougher comp was ? it's really impressive. So Bruce, I was wondering if you can sort of talk about the velocity of deals, I think in your script, you mentioned a higher volume of deals compared to last year. Can you just sort of describe where that demand is coming from, from a vertical perspective or just from a sales perspective? How you driving that that increased volume of blocking and tackling business?",Sanjit Singh,4392932
,,,,
17449,Question-and-Answer,"Sure. Happy too. So it was an extremely high transaction volume quarter led by a one of the highest growth in percentages year-over-year on new customers, what we call a new logo account. And it was also just high transaction volumes within our current customer base as well. And I think that has to do with just the ? on the one hand, the increased operational rigor that we're using to manage the salesforce, and we really picked it up with the pandemic just assuming we just needed to work harder. But that's absolutely paid off for us.",Bruce Felt,4392932
,,,,
17450,Question-and-Answer,"And then at the same time, our offering just fits nicely into what our customers need today. I mean, they need a product that's easy to use, easy to install, easy to rollout to end users that's in the cloud, that's on your phone and that can scale. And just the general trend toward digital transformation within businesses is what we see nicely into, so between the operational rigor and the fact that our solutions really meet with the market needs just drove very healthy transaction volumes this quarter. So we're really pleased with that. It's a very healthy quarter.",Bruce Felt,4392932
,,,,
17451,Question-and-Answer,,Bruce Felt,4392932
,,,,
17452,Question-and-Answer,"That's very promising. And then Josh, if I think about, I was sort of looking at the website earlier today, kind of the messaging just seems so much more targeted and CRISPR sort of positioning Domo as one, data integration platform; two, a business intelligence solution; and three, an intelligent app platform. Can you talk to me about where you're seeing sort of traction, I'm sure like the BI case is sort of obvious, but both on the data integration side and on the intelligent app side, where you're sort of seeing customer traction on those parts of the use cases?",Sanjit Singh,4392932
,,,,
17453,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. I talked about it a little bit at my comments. The fact that we're seeing these POCs, where we'll go in and work with a big customer has usually many experiences trying out those things, usually many experiences with alternatives that are already installed at their place of business. And there's still one or two things they can't get done, and they call us in for POC and we connect the data they haven't been able to connect to before. And then of course, we're able to distribute that data in such a timely quick manner to so many people in the organization. And in most cases, there'll be these apps that we end up helping facilitate low-code, no-code apps. And they really end up helping out with workflow and accomplishing things that they had teams of people that it took to accomplish before, or they weren't even accomplishing it. And so it is a combination of those three things, and it's been exciting to see the pace picking up.",Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17454,Question-and-Answer,"Another thing that we mentioned is Domo Everywhere. And we'll have these large customers that will come in, start using our products and services and find so much benefit from being able to distribute that information so easily with real-time data, no matter the size of the data to all their internal constituents that then of course the next question that that begs is, can we get this to our partners? Can we get this to our vendors? Can we get this to our suppliers?",Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17455,Question-and-Answer,"And we highlighted one of the largest ones that we worked with today with literally tens of thousands of partners, but they're distributing data to, and it's the lifeblood of their business. The relationship with their 10,000 partners is the lifeblood of their business. And they're using us to manage all of those communications now and making those partners so much more adaptive reacting to what's taking place in this ever-changing digital world. So digital transformation is definitely the wave that we're riding and it's these three simple things that we have to do better than anyone else.",Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17456,Question-and-Answer,"That's great. And if I could just speak one last one on ? toggling back to Bruce. If I look at the Q4 guidance, obviously all year, you've been beating and raising that number, even the original guidance for the year, we're now above that, but Q4 does imply a slowdown back to sort of 10% to 11% growth. Can you walk us through some of the underlying assumptions behind your billing side is as we get into sort of year-end from a closure rate or from a demand environment perspective? Just to put some context on the both side into Q4.",Sanjit Singh,4392932
,,,,
17457,Question-and-Answer,"Sure. Well, first let me highlight that we basically brought up our guidance in Q4 by about $6 million of our implied guidance from last quarter. And what drove that was the fact that we are off to get the very good start to Q4, maybe one of our best starts ever for a month. And on top of that, we just have good visibility into our pipeline and it's also supported by the fact that just came off high transaction volumes, which is very, very healthy. I mean, particularly in this environment to have that many new customers and sales and transactions in your current customers which is very healthy.",Bruce Felt,4392932
,,,,
17458,Question-and-Answer,,Bruce Felt,4392932
,,,,
17459,Question-and-Answer,"And we obviously seek to do better than that number. We've used the same approach that we've always used to provide guidance on what we know. And I just have to repeat myself. We know a lot now, and that's why we brought the number up by $6 million. And what we hope for is Q4s are usually very active and we can only guide by what we know, but most of what's going to happen through the rest of the quarter is still before us. But we like what we see so far. So that's the basic thoughts behind our guidance and we're happy that we brought it up like a significant amount from last quarter. And we would love to do better and everything stays the same, and we certainly hope we can do it.",Bruce Felt,4392932
,,,,
17460,Question-and-Answer,That's very clear. Thank you. I appreciate it. Congrats.,Sanjit Singh,4392932
,,,,
17461,Question-and-Answer,"And I'll say something that I've said a few times over the last few quarters. Our goal right now is to get consistently above 20% and then we?ll be getting consistently above 30%. And I think when you look at this one, like Bruce said, I mean, it's a substantial raise from where it was a quarter ago. And so I think that's something that should be definitely taken into account. We crushed our number, hit cash flow positive, did it with lower expenses and brought up guidance by a substantial amounts, and we set up like, there's a lot of gas in the tank there.",Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17462,Question-and-Answer,"And you know what our goals are ? our goals are and what we're trying to accomplish and what we want to consistently be able to deliver, but also guide to. And right now, we're hoping that we can deliver to it, but feel like this is the best place to guide. We don't have ? we haven't had as many quarters of the current situation where we're sitting is, we'd like to be comfortable enough to guide up as high as we'd like to, but definitely see deals and opportunities out there. It looks like this is the appropriate guidance to do, and then hopefully some things will fall away and we'll continue to be north of 20% growth as we have during the last few quarters.",Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17463,Question-and-Answer,"Appreciate it, Josh. Thank you.",Sanjit Singh,4392932
,,,,
17464,Question-and-Answer,Your next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.,Operator,4392932
,,,,
17465,Question-and-Answer,Great. Thank you so much for taking the question and congrats. It's really great to see two quarters in a row now greater than 20% growth and hitting this milestone. There were a lot of naysayers that didn't think you could pull it off and I'm really proud of you guys. So it's good to see this accomplishment yes for sure.,Brad Zelnick,4392932
,,,,
17466,Question-and-Answer,"Maybe my first question if I may, I know we still got to get through Q4, but I imagine you all are doing your planning and thinking forward into next year and understanding that the beginning of a new fiscal year is usually a good time to make some adjustments to your go-to-market strategy. I used to work for a sales leader many years ago that would say whatever you did this year to be successful, you've got to change it up. That's not the work next year. So what are some of the changes that you might be contemplating and how might you be able to mix it up even if just slightly correcting for us to drive real sustainable 20% growth into 2022?",Brad Zelnick,4392932
,,,,
17467,Question-and-Answer,"Well I think some of the things that we are doing to mix it up, we just started many of them. But having Ian as a new sales leader is something that's been a big mix up in terms of how it's affected the team, the way he manages is dramatically different than what we've seen before, and it's proven to be effective. And his leaders that worked for him like him and the teams really kind of snapped into it. So that's been something that I think is going to have an impact for a long time. I think that alone is going to give us 20% growth for a long time.",Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17468,Question-and-Answer,"Then we've got Mellor ? John Mellor, who has been leading the marketing organization. And those two leaders coming together, again, I think that's going to ? just that alone and better execution is going to be north of 20%. I think beyond that, it's been looking at these pockets where ? when we go to markets and what pockets do we have today that we could double down on or triple down on, and we've tried to highlight some of those things, but apps, for instance, is one thing that we see as a big differentiator.",Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17469,Question-and-Answer,,Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17470,Question-and-Answer,"These low-code, no-code apps and solving business problems that's what enabled us to get these state deals and these federal deals, that's what enabled us to get the really large retailer that we talked about global retailer, and then you see Domo Everywhere. That's what's enabling us to get some really large upsells with some of our customers. But our entire sales teams not trained on all of those things. And so saying, okay, what are the three or four things that we can really train the sales team on that are applicable to every single customer? And it's taken some time to gather all that information. So I think that's another area that ? as Ian and John dictate which things we're going to train the team on and go-to-market with. We're going to see some additional performance there.",Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17471,Question-and-Answer,"And then the next, the last thing I would say is finding partners and we highlighted it last quarter and this quarter for the first time seeing some real traction with partners in the marketplace where we're delivering big deals, seven-figure deals from partners, and that's something that we haven't had before. So we'll be seeing our partner efforts continuing to increase and now not just noise, but also deals, and we're excited about what can happen with Snowflake over the long-term. We're excited about our position in the marketplace. We're excited that people are coming to us as a large independent publicly traded business intelligence company. That's cloud-based, we're the only one. And so that's facilitating conversations as well.",Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17472,Question-and-Answer,"No, it shows that a lot of ? lot of these investments that you've been making, like talking about the partner channel, they're really beginning to bear fruit in a meaningful way. And along those lines, Josh, I always felt like there's been this opportunity to become more of a standard inside of your accounts. I feel like some of the early success that we would hear about it, and I know going back to Target and others, like you had some of these massive commitments. But as well, a lot of customers that we would speak to were more, hey, it's a division, it's a specific use case. Just maybe being something beyond a great solution for that particular use case around data aggregation and analytics, are there any proof points that you can speak to just in ? maybe capturing more success in driving that expansion in these larger organizations and becoming that standard?",Brad Zelnick,4392932
,,,,
17473,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. If you look at ? I mean, I think that's the other shoe to drop to be honest with you. But I think about it a lot. If you look at our top 10 customers, the revenue they're receiving from our top 10 customers today is almost double what it was a year ago. And so we're seeing massive expansion inside these accounts where ? yes, this has been a long journey. I always kind of felt like the size of this company, it behaves still like it's one fifth the size, we're still figuring things out as $200 million run rate.",Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17474,Question-and-Answer,"And when you look at some of these accounts, like you said, initially, we got it and we made some great progress. We had a hard time expanding beyond the department that we were in to become the de facto solution because there's all ? there were all these competing components. And so then it took us a long time to figure out how to speak the right language to the different constituents in the organization.",Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17475,Question-and-Answer,"We had to get ? we took a year or two figuring out how to speak to CIOs more effectively, but now we're good at that. And so once we got good at all those things, then it's to your point, where's the proof points. And I was looking at the top 10 customers today and when we have customers paying a several million dollars a year, and one of them still just expanding our second largest customer as a customer that we went into a few years ago, we got a good deal. Then we got another good deal. And then finally we got corporate wide deal. And then we've got a corporate wide deal for all of their vendors. So it does happen.",Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17476,Question-and-Answer,,Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17477,Question-and-Answer,"And as we get more and more customers like that, that we can talk to. What I'm excited about is being able to one of these quarters soon, say, all right, here is five new names. Here's the journey that we just had with them for the last four years. And these are representative of what we think every customer can and should look like because here's the five things that we can do for them that no one else can do. And they're great brands and they're extremely intelligent companies when we have those customers and those proof points just not enough that we're out there publicly talking about it yet, but they have been happening. They've happened, they're signed and more of them are in the pipeline.",Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17478,Question-and-Answer,"And as those come to fruition, then having the sales and marketing organization and what we need to go and tell the customers is going to be every week and all ? almost to sit there and minor current customer base without signing any of any new customers and have years and years of explosive growth. But I think that is what's happening. You've really hit the nail on the head with that question.",Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17479,Question-and-Answer,"Thanks so much, Josh. And if I could sneak in one quick one for the Bruce. Bruce as we think about this milestone of reaching operating cash flow profitability, obviously if we think about the factors it's going to be bookings, billings, topline growth, but it's also going to be, at least in this year, you've had some COVID-related savings. But are there any other key areas of productivity or optimization to call out that we should be thinking about?",Brad Zelnick,4392932
,,,,
17480,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. I mean, I think we have a kind of a twofer working for us right now. I think on the one hand, they're still a lot more, we can get out of our investment platform we have right now in marketing and product. I mean, we still have the ability to get a lot more out of that. But at the same time, we also are in, I would say a pretty comfortable position to start adding resources. For example, we've already started hiring sales reps, and this year has been a year of down reps compared to last year. And that's because we?re very cautious when COVID-19 hit and we've kept the cost as posture, but we've already started adding more reps and layering them in. And so we didn't get ? and we were also quite pleased with the productivity that we got from the reps that we've had.",Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17481,Question-and-Answer,"So we feel very comfortable putting that layer in. And if we can get additional bang on the buck that already exists and then be able to add that in and still generate positive cash flow, we think that's a pretty good spot to be in. But our main focus is really ? we really think that we're well positioned to grow and we want to take advantage of it, but do it prudently, continue to generate positive cash flow and watch the return we get on those investments watching carefully. And so far the indication is that we'll get a great yield from them, but we will still continue to be very careful about it at the same time.",Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17482,Question-and-Answer,Thanks so much guys for taking the questions and congrats again.,Brad Zelnick,4392932
,,,,
17483,Question-and-Answer,Thank you.,Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17484,Question-and-Answer,Your next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood from Cowen and Company. Your line is open.,Operator,4392932
,,,,
17485,Question-and-Answer,"Great. Nice to talk to you guys. And I'll echo my congratulations on lots of good milestones there. Josh, I wanted to touch on Domo Everywhere because it's interesting. Last night, Snowflake talked about seeing a lot of traction with data sharing and that it's really a transformational capability companies are starting to embrace. You guys also have a unique position to serve this kind of capability and it clearly sounds like you're seeing some similar demand. So I guess when you look at your installed base, I mean, can you any way to kind of size up the opportunity you think you have to really cross-sell Domo Everywhere and how are you going to lean into this going out over the next year?",James Wood,4392932
,,,,
17486,Question-and-Answer,,James Wood,4392932
,,,,
17487,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. Domo Everywhere is something that's applicable to almost all of our customers. And it's something that we've put a lot of product effort into especially over the last year as we've seen more and more progress there on the sales side. And it's our high priority right now as well from a product perspective. So we continue to see huge opportunities there and in meeting the needs of the customers and the opportunity there in the marketplace, really in a way that no one else can. So there's embed, which is what a lot of people talk about when they talk about this kind of an opportunity and that's what our competitors do.",Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17488,Question-and-Answer,"But truly taking our whole platform and making that available for our customers to offer to their partners and their vendors and that kind of an experience versus just an embedded analytics. It is a highly complex set of software that really creates an experience that's untouchable. So we feel really good about our unique selling proposition about our differentiators, about our defensibility in that space. And you're going to see some more efforts from us from the product perspective and definitely a lot more efforts from us from a sales perspective and having sales leaders and salespeople that are dedicated to this opportunity that's part of Ian's plans.",Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17489,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. Okay. That makes sense. Then the ? great to hear, you're seeing such a pickup in new logo growth. Can you unpack that a little bit more? Is that driven by better sales productivity? Or are you getting leads from different channels that you didn't have before? And does this suggest you're seeing increased win rates against the competition? Would be great to hear more detail on the underlying drivers.",James Wood,4392932
,,,,
17490,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. I mean, we're getting more referenceable customers and customers that are ? the employees that are moving to other companies and saying, I can't be here without Domo. That's definitely led to a bunch of logos. We've had the execution that I was talking about earlier from Ian and his management team. They have been doing a lot of sales blitzes, and a lot of, I guess, moving to a monthly cadence from a quarterly cadence and having the team on that kind of a cadence, especially when you're kind of in a remote workforce is actually been really positive for us because you don't get to see everybody all the time.",Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17491,Question-and-Answer,You're not walking around cube to cube. And so having everybody really focused on a monthly number has been a part of Ian strategy that's worked really effectively. So those are two of the ways that we've been getting more logos and I'd say the third is just that marketing is continuing to find opportunities in ways to efficiently bring in new logos. And so that seems to be working out for us in terms of picking up the pace and the rate that we can generate new logos for us.,Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17492,Question-and-Answer,"Great. All right. And if I could squeeze one more. Bruce, I think you did mention that you maybe off to the best start of a quarter ever. Anything more to elaborate in terms of what you guys are seeing?",James Wood,4392932
,,,,
17493,Question-and-Answer,"Well, I would just say that the momentum that we experienced in Q3 seems to be continuing, and it makes sense given, again, what Josh has pointed to operationally. The rigor is there, and we're still applying it on the sales side. On the marketing side, again, focused on branding and messaging on certain product areas, getting more clarity, providing better sales tools, the list goes on and on. And fortunately, we've always been worried and cautious given economic environment. But that just seems to be the same. It hasn't deteriorated. And what we said last quarter, if it just stays where it is, we?re in pretty good shape. And it's manifesting itself and just a great start to the quarter. I mean, [indiscernible]. But yes, this is just a continuation of what we've been seeing.",Bruce Felt,4392932
,,,,
17494,Question-and-Answer,,Bruce Felt,4392932
,,,,
17495,Question-and-Answer,"So it gave us the ability to raise guidance by $6 million for a quarter, which frankly is a lot. It's more than we've done in a very, very long time. And I just think we can count on reasonable high level transaction volumes. We can continue to sell. What's good about getting a lot more new customers is we already know we can sell it to them. It doesn't matter the size, we can continue to sell into them. So that just provides more fertile ground for the upsell business.",Bruce Felt,4392932
,,,,
17496,Question-and-Answer,"So we just have everything that seemed to be going our way, and we're going to keep working pretty hard at even doing a better job at acquiring customers at a reasonable cost. We don't feel we're anywhere near our potential. And if we can just keep it up through the rest of this quarter and into next year, we're going to have a good quarter and look forward to a good next year.",Bruce Felt,4392932
,,,,
17497,Question-and-Answer,Sounds good. Well done. Thanks.,James Wood,4392932
,,,,
17498,Question-and-Answer,Thanks a lot.,Bruce Felt,4392932
,,,,
17499,Question-and-Answer,Your next question comes from the line of Jennifer Lowe from UBS. Your line is open.,Operator,4392932
,,,,
17500,Question-and-Answer,"Great. Thank you. Maybe Bruce, can I just follow-up on the last discussion there and just digging slowly deeper because I know you're always very, very conservative on forecasting large deals and it's great to see this high level of transactions, which seem to really be supporting the guidance. But maybe just sort of specifically, I mean, how's the large deal pipeline looking, going into Q4, which is normally a pretty strong quarter for that. And is any of that in the guide or is that sort of upside to even what we're talking about here?",Jennifer Lowe,4392932
,,,,
17501,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. We still are building a large deal pipeline. We have the ability to do that given the size of our customers. The big customers seem to just keep buying more and more, obviously finding more and more use cases. So that's comforting. So we have the ability to keep building a large deal pipeline, but I will say in guidance, it does not assume a significant number of large scales and maybe I need to go even further. It really doesn't assume any single, I'd say reasonably sized deal. So that's good to know because in Q4, we tend to have just lots of activity. It's just the nature of Q4. So the guidance is founded on transaction volume line of sight for what we see a good start with a little bit of upside if we are able to close larger sized deals.",Bruce Felt,4392932
,,,,
17502,Question-and-Answer,"Great. And maybe just taking a step back, I think from the one of the other standouts was just the larger upsell deals that you're doing within your base and given sort of the discussion around, being a bit more flexible how you get into those organizations and then expand once you're in there, it seems to really be playing out. But I'm curious, as you get these seven-figure type deals that are upsells on your existing footprint, is it still largely carving out opportunities around the existing BI footprint? Are you starting to displace some of those categories as the deals get bigger and bigger a bit more?",Jennifer Lowe,4392932
,,,,
17503,Question-and-Answer,"Well, we really talk about ? first of all, I?d say at all our large customers, they have every product out there in the BI space and the reporting space and big data space. So we're able to just solve problems that haven't been solved by other technologies or sets of technologies or combinations of the technologies. And that's pretty comforting. It means we are very unique in our ability to bring that whole stack and then just record time, get data delivered to create data and deliver it in ways that customers just don't have the ability to do it. And that generally comes out of a wide variety of budget and budget areas, some of these are revenue enhancing, so they kind of create their own budgets. But over time, we do start eating into the available budgets for other technologies.",Bruce Felt,4392932
,,,,
17504,Question-and-Answer,,Bruce Felt,4392932
,,,,
17505,Question-and-Answer,"It's our own customers. I mean, this is what we found out earlier. It's our own customers that figured this out and they determined what technologies they can turn off or decommission or roll back. We don't have to do that. And we used to do that. We found that is counter productive. Why don't we just let the customer do that? Why don't we just bring a solution they don't have with the staff they have today? And they'll find all kinds of ways to use it and expand whether or not it's leading into another budget, but we are finding, they are able to start using parts of marketing budget, sales budget, and the IT budget itself.",Bruce Felt,4392932
,,,,
17506,Question-and-Answer,"And our IT friendly message keep everything you have and just extended, allows the IT department to embrace it or even a BI department to embrace it. And sometimes they have this excess budget and sometimes they're able to like rearrange things in our favor. But we like that and figure that out. And so that's been our approach and it's working for us and it's not the same thing we did a few years ago. We think it's a much better way to approach the market a very friendly way, a better partner friendly way, the better customer friendly way. It's certainly a more friendly IT way to go about approaching our customers.",Bruce Felt,4392932
,,,,
17507,Question-and-Answer,Great. Thank you.,Jennifer Lowe,4392932
,,,,
17508,Question-and-Answer,Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Walravens from JMP. Your line is open.,Operator,4392932
,,,,
17509,Question-and-Answer,"Great. Thank you. And let me add my congratulations. So Josh, unless you want your software to be able to do in the future that it can't do today?",Patrick Walravens,4392932
,,,,
17510,Question-and-Answer,"It?s a good question. There's just some additional things, I'd say number one, be more and more partner friendly, so be able to integrate even more seamlessly with partners than we do. We've been able to identify some partners that we have had great successes with, with our customers, but it's taken a little more back into work then maybe if possible. And so seeing those possibilities and trying to identify them and really do more that I think is an opportunity for us on the upside.",Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17511,Question-and-Answer,"And then from a usability perspective, I think once you get all of these executives using these products, there really isn't another ? there's not other software in the world that enterprise CXOs use to run their business besides, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Email, and social media. So this is actually like the real business tool that they use to run their business. And when you're the first company to have those people actually logging in and getting things on their phone and getting text messages and in-app messages, that's a real opportunity and power to leverage in the platform.",Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17512,Question-and-Answer,"And I know that we're the first ones to do that at scale. And we've seen that these customers like that question I was answering earlier about what happens when you get in there and you finally start expanding and seeing these CXOs use these products has been really fun. So I would say there's more opportunity there as well, Pat.",Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17513,Question-and-Answer,"Thanks. And then as we see some of these other companies that are focusing on particular verticals in AI and sometimes extracting really enormous amounts of money, how much of a part of the vision for Domo is that, commercial IoT or government for the intelligence agencies or the media industry?",Patrick Walravens,4392932
,,,,
17514,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. I think we've seen some of the efforts there with our data science and with our AI and ML, and there's certainly more opportunities there. IoT, we put a lot of effort into and it was one of those things that there still needed to be four or five pieces to really finish the solution up. And there has been some players that have taken a really deep approach to very specific niche verticals that they've been really successful and more power to them. It's been awesome to watch them and inspiring certainly and you can see some of the ways that the world's going to evolve and you can see someone gets go deep in an organization. And so I think there is opportunities there as well, and we're continuing to ? I mentioned one of our big efforts in product right now is Domo Everywhere.",Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17515,Question-and-Answer,,Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17516,Question-and-Answer,"The other really big effort underway is just continuing more and more advanced analytics because as we get into these big customers, that's one of the things that they look for from us. If they're going to replace everything else that they have inside the organization, they want to see more and more advanced analytics and more data science opportunities and more machine learning opportunities. And those are some of the partners that I was talking about where I think we have more opportunities to really partner up and become closer to ? there's an ecosystem and that'll help us understand that better.",Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17517,Question-and-Answer,Awesome. Thanks a lot.,Patrick Walravens,4392932
,,,,
17518,Question-and-Answer,Your next question comes from the line of Jack Andrews from Needham. Your line is open.,Operator,4392932
,,,,
17519,Question-and-Answer,Great. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations again on the results. It was nice to see the uptick in gross retention. And I just wanted to flush that out a little bit if we could. You talked about investing in customer success a bit more. Is this ? should we think of this as sort of a new dedicated team and what do you think the impact from a gross retention rates could be moving forward given some of these investments?,Jack Andrews,4392932
,,,,
17520,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. Retention has been awesome. And this is so fun to watch that [indiscernible] numbers that I think we're more used to. It was just a long-term coming in terms of their ? this is a really complex space and we've taken a really broad approach. And so there were a lot of things that we needed to shore up to really prevent, I mean, to create the right kind of experience we wanted our customers to have, and we've done that with the product.",Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17521,Question-and-Answer,"And then it was getting the leadership correct there. And we have a new leader there. That's been doing a great job and his next stable of leaders, they're just on fire. They're having a lot of fun. They're excited about what they do. They love our customers, they love Domo. They're passionate, they love telling me anytime I do anything wrong. And it's just awesome. They're so passionate about what they do, and we're seeing that reflection in the way that they fight for our customers to make sure that the customers get everything that they need in order to return to us and buy more and more products from us. And we're seeing ? we've talked about our upsells, but a big swath of our customer base is upselling and buying additional products and services.",Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17522,Question-and-Answer,"And whether that's buying an extra dollar or an extra million dollars, it's a pretty good sign that they're happy when they're investing more and more into your product. So I think that's the best thing that we're seeing there. And the incremental investments are just as the product ? as the revenue base grows, you need to continue to invest there. And we'll do some innovative things as well, but we have the expense base, that's mapped to that revenue base to be able to do that. So they're not large incremental investments. It's more just ? as the revenue grows, we'll continue making investments there because we love seeing the results that we're getting out of that team.",Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17523,Question-and-Answer,"Great. Thanks for your perspective, and thanks for fitting me into the call.",Jack Andrews,4392932
,,,,
17524,Question-and-Answer,You bet.,Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17525,Question-and-Answer,Your next question comes from the line of Kamil Mielczarek from William Blair. Your line is open.,Operator,4392932
,,,,
17526,Question-and-Answer,Hey guys. It?s Bhavan here. Thanks for taking the question.,Bhavanmit Suri,4392932
,,,,
17527,Question-and-Answer,"Hey, Bhavan.",Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17528,Question-and-Answer,"Hey, and congrats on the billings number. That was really good. Maybe one for Josh here, you touched on partners and I want to focus on the SI partners a little bit. And it's really exciting you?re starting to see them deliver implementations of that scale. I guess have you seen any of them, Josh, start to implement applications on behalf of customers where they're starting to monetize themselves a little bit? Is that some of that could happen or should happen over time?",Bhavanmit Suri,4392932
,,,,
17529,Question-and-Answer,,Bhavanmit Suri,4392932
,,,,
17530,Question-and-Answer,"It definitely happened over time and we're starting to see some of that. I mean the federal deal that we talked about, that?s definitely one of those situations where they ? they were really happy to go to market with us. They chose us. It was a big take-off. They went and then they took their combined proposal in and we?re successful at selling that to the federal government. And so that was really nice to see. We think there's a lot more of these to come.",Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17531,Question-and-Answer,"I really think that that question was asked early on in the call was really apropos for where we're at right now. It's the other shoe hasn't dropped in terms of people understanding how successful we really are at our big accounts, and how we really do a takeover and they sunset all of their other tools eventually and really centering on us from top to bottom in their organization, and then expanding out from the organization to their vendors and suppliers. So I think as that kind of messaging gets out there more, hopefully as analysts write more favorable ? industry analysts write more favorable reports about us when ? as they get their quadrants to [indiscernible] more, I think, where the market is going, which is where we've always been. Then we'll see some more success in those areas, but there is been some headwinds there historically for sure.",Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17532,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. Because ultimately that I think becomes really interesting flywheel long-term because they have such high CX level relationships. It's good to hear though that it's starting to happen a little bit. A quick one for Bruce, actually two quick ones for Bruce. One, you guys have talked about sort of continuously improving enterprise sales productivity, obviously it improved given you a couple number of sales reps, but the billings, et cetera have been really strong. I guess, are you at a point where you don't think you have room for more productivity given you want to ramp up more sales people? Or is there still room for productivity and the ramp on sales people sort of in a 12-month period has led to layer in on top of the improved productivity, [indiscernible] the dynamics between those two pieces of the sales investment coming out?",Bhavanmit Suri,4392932
,,,,
17533,Question-and-Answer,"Well, we measure the productivity on the concept of a ramp head, a ramp rep, and that's been nice and healthy. So we give depending on whether it's a corporate rep or an enterprise rep six months to nine months, sometimes 12 months. So in answering your question, there is absolutely built-in ramping on the reps we have, so that really sets up growth for us.",Bruce Felt,4392932
,,,,
17534,Question-and-Answer,"And then on top of that, we plan to hire more reps and yes, they need to ramp and we have a ramping schedule. So as we layer them in and that's kind of another layer of growth, and then we still have ? even though we're pleased with the overall productivity of salesforce, we still think there's even room to improve that over time. And so that way we have like three ways to grow if we focus on just the concept of productivity per rep. So that's how we think about it.",Bruce Felt,4392932
,,,,
17535,Question-and-Answer,"Got it. And then one quick one for both of you or even if Ian is there. But the visibility, this question has come up with investors, which is, as people have seen a demand pickup in the back half of this year and people accelerated digital transformation initiatives, analytics initiatives, we need to get data to executives and among devices faster, et cetera. As you look for ? and I know you're not giving guidance, but as you look forward, do you worry that there's an air pocket, Q1, Q2 next year, what people then take a pause. How do you think about that vis--vis visibility maybe compared to where it was a year ago or two years ago? I'd just love to get ? understand how you're thinking about that? Thanks.",Bhavanmit Suri,4392932
,,,,
17536,Question-and-Answer,,Bhavanmit Suri,4392932
,,,,
17537,Question-and-Answer,"Well, I mean, what we have going for us is just the whole portfolio like industries, customer sizes, types of customers, types of use cases that are just common sense use of our platform such as ours to just simply get data to people in ways they just can't get today. And I don't see why that's going to change at any time in the future. And we certainly argue as the economy gets better, it ought to get better, maybe the activity ought to pickup in those troubled industries, finally can start purchasing from us. I guess they ? I mean, we've had success with troubled industries, it?s been not nearly what we would have had and we now have to seeking on the downturn.",Bruce Felt,4392932
,,,,
17538,Question-and-Answer,"I think one of the ? Bruce didn't say one of the ? I think hesitations around calling some of the big deals is, one of my reps just texted me an answer, they're listening to the questions and I got a text message and it says, tell them the answers to cure COVID. COVID [indiscernible] from the sense that it's really helped, I think accelerated a lot of digital transformation and it's helped us pickup new partners and really prove our ability to be ? to rapidly respond and to have a very flexible local offering, et cetera, et cetera.",Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17539,Question-and-Answer,"At the same time, there's still just unknowns out there. And you're talking to big customers about really large deals and you know it's not a normal environment. So as much as you know that they need us, it just gets really hesitant to start calling those deals, when it would meaningfully impact your guidance. So I think that is in fact one of the answers. But pipeline is looking good. I mean we have really interesting conversations with customers that we've known for a long time, and those are really big upsells that are out there.",Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17540,Question-and-Answer,"And we're also seeing new customers come in that know what we've done for other customers because our customer left their former employer and went to a new one and brings us a big juicy deal. So there is deals out there for sure. And like Bruce said earlier, we've had a good beginning of our quarter and we brought in some decent sized deals already. And just be interesting to see how the rest of this quarter plays out. But we've been a 20% grower for the last few quarters and we're going to do our damnedest to make sure that's the case again just given the environment that we're all living in, it feels appropriate to be a little conservative.",Joshua James,4392932
,,,,
17541,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. There's a [certain metric phasing as you guys said seems to be doing well]. Well, congrats guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. I appreciate it.",Bhavanmit Suri,4392932
,,,,
17542,Question-and-Answer,Yes. Thanks a lot.,Bruce Felt,4392932

,,,,
17549,Presentation,"Some of our discussion and responses today will include forward-looking statements, including with respect to our expectations, outlook and financial guidance. So, as a reminder, our actual results could differ materially as a result of a variety of factors.

,,,,
17552,Presentation,"And with that, let me turn it over to Tien.",Carolyn Bass,4392927
,,,,
17553,Presentation,"Thanks, Carolyn. And thank you everyone for joining us today on Zuora's third quarter earnings call for fiscal 2021. I'm very pleased with our third quarter results. Let's walk through a few key highlights from the quarter.",Tien Tzuo,4392927
,,,,
17554,Presentation,"We exceeded expectations across our key financial metrics, including total revenue, subscription revenue, gross margin, operating income and free cash flow. And this is even after backing out the impact of a one-time benefit that Todd will discuss later. In fact, we reached a milestone of free cash flow breakeven one quarter ahead of plan. ",Tien Tzuo,4392927
,,,,
17555,Presentation,"We added 25 new customers in Q3, including the largest deal in the company's history. We closed six deals with over $500,000 in annual contract value. We had over 100 upsells, showing a strong continued potential of our land and expand go-to-market motion. We got 41 customers to go live. Over one-third of the go-lives involved a systems integration partner, showing strong progress in our alliances strategy. ",Tien Tzuo,4392927
,,,,
17556,Presentation,"Finally, we had strong adoption of our most recent products. More than two-thirds of our customers are already using our platform capabilities like workflow, custom objects and increased agility, and over a quarter of our customers are now using our analytics tool, which we just launched last quarter. ",Tien Tzuo,4392927
,,,,
17557,Presentation,"These results show that we are making good progress of the things that we outlined in previous quarters. First, in previous quarters, we've talked about how we believe that our market opportunity resonates with bigger companies as changing customer preferences force big brands to rethink how they innovate and turn their customers into subscribers. ",Tien Tzuo,4392927
,,,,
17558,Presentation,,Tien Tzuo,4392927
,,,,
17559,Presentation,"And indeed, we are seeing more big brands embrace subscription models. Our enterprise pipeline continues to grow. We're seeing bigger yield sizes. Now, as we move up market, you may see the pace of net new customer adds per quarter be lighter than historical trends, but you'll also see overall ACV per customer trend higher. ",Tien Tzuo,4392927
,,,,
17560,Presentation,"Second, as I mentioned on our last call, our platform is a critical part of our ability to meet the last mile needs of these larger companies. And indeed, our platform is resonating with our customers and prospects alike. ",Tien Tzuo,4392927
,,,,
17561,Presentation,The hardest part of running a subscription business is delivering the automation needed with agility. And our platform is truly what enables this. It differentiates Zuora from other vendors in the marketplace. Our platform is a key reason why we have been successful. It has allowed us to win deals that we otherwise would not have won. ,Tien Tzuo,4392927
,,,,
17562,Presentation,"Thirdly, you've heard us say that the system integrators are a really important partner in our journey. And those partners continue to deepen. Indeed, in Q3, SIs experienced increased demand for subscription and revenue automation offerings from their customers, and often relied on our technology to capitalize on this demand. ",Tien Tzuo,4392927
,,,,
17563,Presentation,"Finally, you've heard us say in previous quarters that in order to scale to meet the demands of the marketplace, we needed to shift to a consistent way of selling, one that depends on systems, and not just people, and one that works with enterprise accounts. ",Tien Tzuo,4392927
,,,,
17564,Presentation,"We continue to see results from our go-to-market changes we implemented a year ago, which included refining our value selling motion and our sales organization focus. I'll discuss this more in a few minutes. ",Tien Tzuo,4392927
,,,,
17565,Presentation,"Let's drill into each of these four themes. First, we are seeing big brands continue to embrace the subscription models. We continue to move up market and find partnership with global enterprise companies. During this quarter, we signed agreements with big brands in our core markets of high tech, media, manufacturing, including companies like Fuji Xerox, illycaff, The Catalogue [ph], and one of the top three electronic retailers in the US. ",Tien Tzuo,4392927
,,,,
17566,Presentation,"We continue to execute go-lives in big brands across industries. In media and publishing, companies like Thomson Reuters and Media24; in tech manufacturing, including Bosch Automotive Services, Sonos, Panasonic and Siemens Smart Infrastructure. We continue to help big brands seeking to turn their customers into subscribers. ",Tien Tzuo,4392927
,,,,
17567,Presentation,"illycaff is a very interesting use case here. We're helping them launch a subscription service that will give them regular touchpoints with the customer base as well as a steady, predictable source of recurring revenue. And we're seeing this dynamic play out across the entire consumer, retail and consumer packaged goods space. ",Tien Tzuo,4392927
,,,,
17568,Presentation,"We continue to help our large manufacturing high tech clients find new sources of growth. In Japan, with the addition of Fuji Xerox, we're now working with the top five multifunction printer manufacturers. We're helping all five of them launch flexible subscription services within a very competitive hardware market. ",Tien Tzuo,4392927
,,,,
17569,Presentation,"And we continue to grow the number of our customers with ACVs at or over $100,000. This group now constitutes over 90% of our business, reaching a total of 653 companies at the end of the third quarter. ",Tien Tzuo,4392927
,,,,
17570,Presentation,"So, these larger big brand enterprise customers ultimately represent a significant opportunity for expansion and growth as they continue to shift their businesses towards subscription models. ",Tien Tzuo,4392927
,,,,
17571,Presentation,"Let me shift now to provide some more color on the progress of our platform offering. We believe that the success we've had in closing these large deals is in big part due to our Zuora Central Platform, which is a suite of developer tools that we launched earlier this year. Its features are now being used by two-thirds of our customer base. This is a key competitive differentiator, particularly within the large enterprise deals. ",Tien Tzuo,4392927
,,,,
17572,Presentation,,Tien Tzuo,4392927
,,,,
17573,Presentation,"So why is the platform so important? Well, a key part of winning the subscription economy is delivering a great subscription experience. Think of your own life today. How much of it is driven by services that you access from your phone or laptop, whether it's for entertainment or food, health, learning or more. Our expectations are changing and companies know they have to adapt to meet these expectations. ",Tien Tzuo,4392927
,,,,
17574,Presentation,"Delivering a great subscriber experience is not easy. Every touchpoint from the customer, service activation, payments, usage, renewals, upgrades, suspensions, every touchpoint requires coordination across a plethora of actions. Customer facing operations like charging credit cards, internal operations like provisioning or shipping, and even financial operations like chargebacks or recognizing revenue. ",Tien Tzuo,4392927
,,,,
17575,Presentation,"That's why automation is so critical. You can't deliver a great subscriber experience without automation. For example, we work with 9 of the top 20 largest auto manufacturers. We added another one this quarter. ",Tien Tzuo,4392927
,,,,
17576,Presentation,"Now imagine millions of cars on the road, all powered by connected services. Our platform workflow tools today enable our auto customers to successfully orchestrate a number of connected car services, from finding parking spots, listening to music or subscribing to add-on capabilities, thereby enhancing the value that they're delivering to their customers.",Tien Tzuo,4392927
,,,,
17577,Presentation,"However, in automating the old way by hard-coding integrations on legacy platforms, you lose your agility. And this is why our platform is so important. We deliver automation at scale while maintaining agility. ",Tien Tzuo,4392927
,,,,
17578,Presentation,"In fact, this quarter, one of the top three electronic retailers in the US cited our platform is a key factor in its buying decision because our platform tools will allow this company to quickly and efficiently launch and manage warranty programs, repair services, video streaming trust files [ph]. These are real tangible benefits that this customer is using to enhance value with its own customers. ",Tien Tzuo,4392927
,,,,
17579,Presentation,"In short, our platform tools allow companies to expand and integrate Zuora into their business. It helps those companies solve their last mile logistical needs and it gives them much needed agility and it makes us more sticky as a result. ",Tien Tzuo,4392927
,,,,
17580,Presentation,"Let me now review our progress with our system integration partners. As you know, at the onset of this year, we realigned our alliances team to deepen our relationship with our SIs. These efforts are beginning to bear fruit. ",Tien Tzuo,4392927
,,,,
17581,Presentation,"Zuora has established strong partnerships with Accenture, Capgemini, Deloitte, EY and PwC, among others. In fact, in Q3, we expanded our SI relationships including signing a formal agreement with a large technology services company who has embedded Zuora into their enterprise solution stack for digital transformation initiatives. ",Tien Tzuo,4392927
,,,,
17582,Presentation,"Our joint customers now include some of the world's largest automobile manufacturers, as well as The Catalogue, a large retailer in France. We signed an agreement with PBC Consulting Japan to bring as-a-service solution to that market and several of our SIs have dramatically increased their number of certified partner consultants this year. ",Tien Tzuo,4392927
,,,,
17583,Presentation,"Most importantly, we're seeing a number of our SI partners actively influencing and even sourcing new deal activity in Zuora. In Q3, we increased the ACV of deals closed that were partner sourced by over 150% quarter-over-quarter and we nearly doubled year-over-year ACV from deals sourced through partners. In fact, over one-third of the 41 go-lives we had this quarter involved an SI partner.",Tien Tzuo,4392927
,,,,
17584,Presentation,"Indeed, we're still early in our SI initiatives, but we are pleased with our current progress and believe that we are well positioned for continued momentum in the SI ecosystem based on the quality of the global pipeline we see ahead. ",Tien Tzuo,4392927
,,,,
17585,Presentation,,Tien Tzuo,4392927
,,,,
17586,Presentation,"And, of course, as our business makes it easier to shift towards subscriptions and away from services, we expect our overall gross margins to continue to improve. ",Tien Tzuo,4392927
,,,,
17587,Presentation,"Finally, let me provide an update on how our new go-to-market changes are working. The short answer is they are working well. Over the past decade plus, we believe that Zuora has built the most sophisticated industry-leading subscription management tools. With these products in our arsenal, we opened up a large market opportunity, which required changes in how we go-to-market. ",Tien Tzuo,4392927
,,,,
17588,Presentation,"Specifically, we shifted our go-to-market focus on the enterprise space where we believe we have the largest addressable market. We implemented a value selling methodology, one that emphasizes return on investments to our customers. We moved from a hunter farmer model to having all sales reps own their accounts throughout the entire customer relationship, leading to higher quality relationships that drive upsell opportunities. ",Tien Tzuo,4392927
,,,,
17589,Presentation,"We moved from individual selling to a team selling model with a full complement of skills needed to serve larger customers, including our newly formed Subscribed Strategy Group. Everyone on the team is focused on the same set of customers, and this leads to higher levels of customer success. ",Tien Tzuo,4392927
,,,,
17590,Presentation,"These changes are starting to pay off as evidenced by the number of enterprise customer wins in the quarter, the number of upsells and the growth of our enterprise pipeline. All these have also contributed to a steady improvement in win rates over the past year. ",Tien Tzuo,4392927
,,,,
17591,Presentation,"In addition, we monitor the distribution of the team and by sales team. We are seeing more consistent productivity throughout our sales organization, giving us increased confidence that these initiatives will contribute to additional scale in our go-to-market market efforts. ",Tien Tzuo,4392927
,,,,
17592,Presentation,"Lastly, we expect this to translate into higher net dollar retention over time, delivering greater lifetime value. ",Tien Tzuo,4392927
,,,,
17593,Presentation,"In short, we believe we have made meaningful improvements in Zuora's go-to-market initiatives and we are poised for strong long-term continued execution as we look ahead. ",Tien Tzuo,4392927
,,,,
17594,Presentation,"Now, let me turn over the call to Todd to discuss our financials in more detail. Todd?",Tien Tzuo,4392927
,,,,
17595,Presentation,"Thanks, Tien. And thanks everyone for joining the call today. Our third quarter performance exceeded expectations across our key financial metrics. I'm particularly pleased with our ability to show additional leverage in our operating model. We posted breakeven free cash flow one quarter ahead of plan. As we look ahead, we plan to drive additional margin improvements and build a more efficient company. ",Todd McElhatton ,4392927
,,,,
17596,Presentation,"Let me review our operating margins. Q3 was highlighted by good traction in the larger enterprise segment as Tien noted earlier. Looking at customers over $100,000 and higher in ACV, we ended with 653 customers, reflecting an 11% year-over-year growth. This customer group continues to represent 90% of our business. ",Todd McElhatton ,4392927
,,,,
17597,Presentation,"We added a total of 25 new customers in the quarter. And as Tien noted, the size of customer deals we added was larger than historical levels, primarily as a result of our success selling in larger enterprises. ",Todd McElhatton ,4392927
,,,,
17598,Presentation,"In Q3, we closed six deals with ACV over $500,000, including the largest deal in the company's history. As we discussed on our Q2 call, we were impacted with a higher level of churn in the prior quarter as a result of the pandemic and M&A. As we shared with you, we expected the Q2 to be our toughest quarter for churn. This indeed transpired. And in q3, we saw churn decrease 55% from the prior quarter and return to our historical average. Long term, we aim to improve this metric. ",Todd McElhatton ,4392927
,,,,
17599,Presentation,"In Q3, net dollar retention was flat quarter-over-quarter at 99%. As a reminder, we track net dollar retention on a trailing 12-month basis. And as a result, this is a lagging indicator. The higher level of churn we experienced in Q2 will weigh in on this metric looking ahead as we lapse this metric over time. ",Todd McElhatton ,4392927
,,,,
17600,Presentation,,Todd McElhatton ,4392927
,,,,
17601,Presentation,"Turning to transaction volume, our systems processed over $14 billion of volume in the quarter, which represents 31% year-over-year growth. Process transaction volume is helpful in understanding how much of our customers' business is running through our platform. But it does not track linearly to the quarterly revenue as our customers gain efficiencies as they scale. ",Todd McElhatton ,4392927
,,,,
17602,Presentation,"Next, let me review our Q3 financial results. Subscription revenue grew 15% year-over-year to $62 million. Note that Q3 subscription revenue included a one-time non-recurring benefit of $1.5 million, which we did not include in our Q3 guidance. Normalizing for this, our Q3 subscription revenue still came in above the high end of our guidance. ",Todd McElhatton ,4392927
,,,,
17603,Presentation,"Professional services revenue decreased 14% year-over-year to $15.2 million, primarily driven by the shifting of services work to our system integrator partners. This is in line with our strategy to improve our mix toward the higher margin subscription revenue. ",Todd McElhatton ,4392927
,,,,
17604,Presentation,"In Q3, subscription revenue represented 80% of total revenue. This is our highest level in over three years. This resulted in total revenue growing to $77.2 million for the quarter. ",Todd McElhatton ,4392927
,,,,
17605,Presentation,"Looking at our margins, we continue to make strides. We have been successful at driving the mix of subscription revenue as a higher percent of total revenue. As we drive more professional services to the SI channel, our gross margin improved. ",Todd McElhatton ,4392927
,,,,
17606,Presentation,"Non-GAAP blended gross margins closed the quarter at 63%, an improvement of over 500 basis points from Q3 in the prior year. Non-GAAP subscription gross margins were 78%. Non-GAAP services gross margin was 1%, consistent with what we shared with you on past calls. We will continue to run services on a breakeven basis and drive additional leverage as we engage with more of our trusted SI partners. ",Todd McElhatton ,4392927
,,,,
17607,Presentation,"Non-GAAP operating loss was breakeven in the quarter, reflecting a $7.3 million improvement over the prior year. This was driven by reduced spend on T&E, events and office spend as well as the one-time benefit. The combination of effective cost management coupled with our improving gross margins led to a breakeven non-GAAP operating profit well ahead of expectations. ",Todd McElhatton ,4392927
,,,,
17608,Presentation,"Now, let's turn to billings and cash flow. Calculated subscriptions billings in Q3 was $70.8 million, reflecting growth of 14% year-over-year, a dramatic improvement from the prior quarter. We have planned for a modest improvement to the metric after the prior quarter. But we managed to outperform primarily due to our up-market enterprise wins. ",Todd McElhatton ,4392927
,,,,
17609,Presentation,"Moving to our cash flow numbers. Q3 cash flow was breakeven, over $5 million ahead of expectations, driven by lower costs, the one-time benefit and strong collections activities during the quarter. ",Todd McElhatton ,4392927
,,,,
17610,Presentation,"Total CapEx for the quarter was $1.4 million, net of insurance recoveries. ",Todd McElhatton ,4392927
,,,,
17611,Presentation,"For Q4, we expect to be cash flow positive, driven by the usual Q4 seasonality. ",Todd McElhatton ,4392927
,,,,
17612,Presentation,"As I mentioned last quarter, we believe it's important that we improve our operating leverage and create efficiencies in business, and I'm pleased we're making good progress on our free cash flow metric. ",Todd McElhatton ,4392927
,,,,
17613,Presentation,"Turning to cash, we ended the quarter with $178.8 million in cash and cash equivalents, roughly in line with the prior quarter. We continue to be prudent with respect to spending levels and have maintained a healthy cash position to manage the business. ",Todd McElhatton ,4392927
,,,,
17614,Presentation,Our fully diluted share count as of the end of the quarter was approximately 131.8 million shares using the treasury stock method. ,Todd McElhatton ,4392927
,,,,
17615,Presentation,"Overall, we reported solid performance in Q3. We see continued signs that our quarter-over-quarter enterprise pipeline is growing. We continue to be very disciplined in our investments. We have experienced success with larger customers and working with our SI partners. ",Todd McElhatton ,4392927
,,,,
17616,Presentation,"Now, let's turn to our financial outlook. Our subscription business model continues to be resilient, but we continue to see economic uncertainty in the market. We're making a number of changes to the business and working to shift more services revenue to our SI partners. ",Todd McElhatton ,4392927
,,,,
17617,Presentation,,Todd McElhatton ,4392927
,,,,
17618,Presentation,"For fiscal Q4, we expect subscription revenue of $62 million to $63 million; total revenue of $75 million to $77 million; non-GAAP operating loss of $5.5 million to $4.5 million; a non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.06 to $0.05, assuming a weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 120 million; we expect calculated subscription billings to grow approximately 8% to 10% year-over-year as we face a tough compare versus Q4 of last year when we posted our highest ever bookings quarter.",Todd McElhatton ,4392927
,,,,
17619,Presentation,"In closing, on the guidance topic, while I expect near-term economic uncertainty to persist, we continue to be enthusiastic about Zuora's long-term opportunity. The Zuora team continues to make great strides and are optimistic about our long-term subscription revenue growth. ",Todd McElhatton ,4392927
,,,,
17620,Presentation,"As we look ahead to fiscal 2022, we will continue to invest in our go-to-market initiatives, which are showing traction, and to innovate on our product roadmap, while remaining diligent and agile about the need to respond quickly to changes in the macro environment. ",Todd McElhatton ,4392927
,,,,
17621,Presentation,"Now, Tien and I will open up the call for your questions. Operator? ",Todd McElhatton ,4392927
,,,,
17622,Question-and-Answer,[Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from the line of Chris Merwin from Goldman Sachs. ,Operator,4392927
,,,,
17623,Question-and-Answer,"I wanted to ask about the large deal in the quarter. I think you mentioned it was the largest you ever signed. Could you share a bit more about maybe what industry the customer was in, what was included in that deal? Was it just the core billing product or was there platform in there as well, maybe [indiscernible] other things? I'd love just to hear a bit more about that deal. Thanks. ",Christopher Merwin,4392927
,,,,
17624,Question-and-Answer,"It was one of the top three electronic retailers. And it's a big, big strategic bet. Obviously, with what's going on in the retail industry, certainly, we see the shift from retail stores to e-commerce going on right now. But I think the story is much more deeper than that. The retailers are realizing that waiting for the customers to purchase something or to come to the website or to go to the store is not sufficient. They've got to deepen their relationships. They're going to have a lot more constant interactions with their customers. They've got these fantastic brands. But how do they translate those brands into a deep customer relationship? In other words, turn the customers into subscribers. ",Tien Tzuo,4392927
,,,,
17625,Question-and-Answer,"The deal was for the billing product, but think of it as a broader subscription management system. And it was for the platform. As we get into the implementation, as we continue to create customer success, we will have other opportunities to upsell the customers as well. ",Tien Tzuo,4392927
,,,,
17626,Question-and-Answer,"Maybe just a follow-up. I think you also mentioned in the prepared remarks that two-thirds of your customers are using platform and I think a quarter of customers are using analytics. Obviously, very strong attach rates for both of those products. Can you talk a bit more about how you're charging for both of those and how we should think about improving attach of platform and analytics, benefiting net retention going forward? ",Christopher Merwin,4392927
,,,,
17627,Question-and-Answer,"You can see the key part of our strategy and our ability to drive net dollar retention up over time is we have a very sticky product. We've got a great customer base. You've seen us skew towards larger companies that are going to have longevity. And so, the ability for us to go back and sell a broader suite of products after the initial sales is really important. So, the adoption of what we have, we're feeling really, really good about. ",Tien Tzuo,4392927
,,,,
17628,Question-and-Answer,"The products are priced in different ways. It really depends, but they're primarily based on the functionality of the system. And we're not at this point yet where we're ready to sort of break out our revenue by these different product lines. I think I'd like to see everything be a little bit more mature before we do that. But it's very promising that we're able to bring these new products to market as well. ",Tien Tzuo,4392927
,,,,
17629,Question-and-Answer,,Tien Tzuo,4392927
,,,,
17630,Question-and-Answer,"This is Todd. Maybe a little bit more color too. As customers are utilizing the platform, we'll have the ability to upgrade. And as you're aware, we've got three different editions in the platform. We have Growth, we have Enterprise, we have Nine. And so, this will certainly give customers a reason to upgrade as they have more use of the platform and get more use out of the functionality. ",Todd McElhatton,4392927
,,,,
17631,Question-and-Answer,Next question comes from the line of Stan Zlotsky from Morgan Stanley. ,Operator,4392927
,,,,
17632,Question-and-Answer,"Hi, everyone. This is Calvin Chu on for Stan. I just have two questions for you guys. The first one is, what are you seeing out of the partner ecosystem? I know you mentioned it. And it sounds great. And I just wanted to know, in terms of both as a go-to-market motion and how partners are continuing to build out practices around you, could you comment a little bit more on where you see that going and trending over the next few quarters?",Calvin Chu,4392927
,,,,
17633,Question-and-Answer,"We feel really good. If you look at the statistics, we've mentioned one-third of our customers that went live this past quarter, there was an SI involved in that implementation. I think that's the reality that we're going to, right? I know you phrased it as these SIs are building practices around Zuora. What these Sis are really doing is they're building practices around digital transformation. And they're realizing that this next phase of digital transformation is not just playing around with digital technologies, but actually turning them into revenue, right? Turning to real revenue. And by and large, these tend to be subscription based or recurring revenues. They are customer-centric revenues. And when you look at what's happening with the physical product space, manufacturing, they're all launching products, they are connected to the Internet. And these companies are excited about the vast new revenue streams that are available to them. And so, the Sis are really a big, big part of that. And so, what we're seeing is, as they're trying to build out their digital transformation or grow their digital transformation practices, we are a key part of that because it's all about monetizing your customer relationship, monetizing your digital initiatives. Our platform is really the best platform to do so. It's the only platform that gives you the insights, the agility, the automation of [indiscernible] subscription economy. ",Tien Tzuo,4392927
,,,,
17634,Question-and-Answer,"On to my second question. Could you comment a bit on sales productivity within the quarter? I know you mentioned that churn has returned to normal levels. And where do you see that going over the next few quarters, especially with COVID and with the overall macro environment? ",Calvin Chu,4392927
,,,,
17635,Question-and-Answer,"Calvin, we would look to stay at the historical levels that we've had. So, we feel like we'll be in the same range where we've been prior. The other thing that I guess I would say is, from a sales productivity, we continue to see improvements in the productivity that we've seen from the sales force. And we're really pleased with changes that have happened there and where we expect it to be. ",Todd McElhatton,4392927
,,,,
17636,Question-and-Answer,And your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from Jefferies. ,Operator,4392927
,,,,
17637,Question-and-Answer,"This is Luv Sodha on for Brent Thill. Congrats on a nice quarter. It's good to see some improvement. I wanted to ask a question on the go-to-market motion and the pipelines, if you will. It sounds like you guys are having increased enterprise traction. And one of the themes that we've seen in our partner checks is that the front office was sort of the focus in 2020. But in 2021, the focus is going to be back offices digital transformation. And so, maybe as you look to the next year, what are you seeing up there in the pipelines? Is there sort of like a pent-up demand that we could see come back next year? ",Luv Sodha,4392927
,,,,
17638,Question-and-Answer,,Luv Sodha,4392927
,,,,
17639,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. I would say, the definition of the words, front office and back office, that might be a little bit dated, right? And that division made a lot of sense when you were shipping product. The front office sold the product, the back office fulfilled, it accounted for it, collected for it. And it's a very product centric view of the world. And if you look at the companies that are subscription businesses, they've always been subscription businesses. For example, the telecom companies. They don't look at it like that. They start with the customer and they build great subscriber experiences for those customers. And those subscribers? experiences have to span the front office and they have to span the back office, right, whether it's calling the call center or changing your credit card on your billing account or spinning up some more service on a Sunday night without having to talk to a salesperson, those are the things that are the most important. ",Tien Tzuo,4392927
,,,,
17640,Question-and-Answer,"And what companies are realizing is, if they're going to win in the future ? just think about your own life right now, sitting at home, picking up your phone, and then food shows up. You get work done. Entertainment shows up. Those are the subscription experiences you will demand going forward. Companies realize that and they realize that that, in order to do so, they have to put in a customer-centric subscription management platform. ",Tien Tzuo,4392927
,,,,
17641,Question-and-Answer,"And so, what we're seeing on a broader sense is the COVID shelter in place situation, it?s only accelerating companies' efforts to say we have to go build customer-centric subscription business model. That's really the business model of the future. ",Tien Tzuo,4392927
,,,,
17642,Question-and-Answer,"And maybe one additional one on the go-to-market changes. It sounds like you're having some traction with that. I guess, in terms of the competitors, you're seeing as we go more up market, are you mainly replacing Excel systems or is it more legacy competitors who weren't meeting the needs? Thank you. ",Luv Sodha,4392927
,,,,
17643,Question-and-Answer,"We replaced homegrown billing systems, we replaced Excel spreadsheets. A lot of times we're doing launches where it's a greenfield opportunity. It's the first time they're actually launching a subscription business. So, it's a brand new application. In those situations, we have to get customers up and running in 90 days or less. And I would say, though, that as we go up market, as subscriptions are becoming more mainstream, one of the things that you're going to see us focus more on ? this is where the platform is really, really important is, how do I integrate this thing within my existing enterprise application backbone, right? It's okay to launch something on the side, but when the subscription starts becoming 5%, 10%, 20%, 30% of my revenues, then integrating into my existing enterprise software backbone is really, really important. And we're doing a lot of those types of work with the big companies. ",Tien Tzuo,4392927
,,,,
17644,Question-and-Answer,And your next question comes from the line of Joseph Vafi from Canaccord. ,Operator,4392927
,,,,
17645,Question-and-Answer,"Nice to see the good results here. Tien, it seems like we heard a lot more about platform this quarter than the last couple. I'm just kind of wondering, number one, if you kind of see this quarter as a little bit of a breakout on that product? ",Joseph Vafi,4392927
,,,,
17646,Question-and-Answer,"And then secondly, it'd be interesting to get a little bit of a metric on where platform was last quarter in terms of customer usage? And then maybe a follow-up after that. ",Joseph Vafi,4392927
,,,,
17647,Question-and-Answer,"I think about the platform all the time. And a gradual evolution of the software companies, especially something we do which is a mission critical system, the platform strategies become really important. These large companies, this last mile customization, a lot of times, that's where their secret sauce lies. And so, the ability for them to customize the system to meet their exact needs is really, really important. And our platform continues to advance. And every quarter, there's new capabilities, right? Most recently, we talked about launching custom objects, custom query capability. We've got other things that are ? we're cooking in the labs, if you will. And those tools continue to evolve to help companies do some pretty amazing things. ",Tien Tzuo,4392927
,,,,
17648,Question-and-Answer,,Tien Tzuo,4392927
,,,,
17649,Question-and-Answer,"And so, I'm trying to remember what we said last quarter in terms of adoption, but it was it was south of the 230 number we said today. And so, our expectation really is that every one of our companies will ultimately use the platform because they all have specific needs that they want to do that the platform really enables. ",Tien Tzuo,4392927
,,,,
17650,Question-and-Answer,"And then, Todd, maybe on net retention, I know it's a trailing 12-month metric. But I think in Tien's prepared remarks, said you had 100 upsells in the quarter. And is there any way to look at net dollar retention or kind of a view of it or an opinion on it kind of on a run rate basis or kind of excluding a little bit of the kind of one-timers in Q2 just to kind of get a feel for the cadence of the business on that metric at least right now? ",Joseph Vafi,4392927
,,,,
17651,Question-and-Answer,"I think I would look at net retention, as you said, trailing metric, we feel really good about the upsells we had. But I think more importantly, if you look at the actual dollar turn, that decreased 55% from Q2. We said we thought Q2 would be our toughest. And that definitely turned out to be the case. But more importantly, when we look at the retention, we actually improved year-over-year. So, from my perspective, I think that gives the color that we're on the right track with retention. And we'll aim not only to keep the churn down, but continue to move forward on the upsells. ",Todd McElhatton,4392927
,,,,
17652,Question-and-Answer,"And then just maybe ? I'll just sneak one more in. Is it fair to say that with some of these ? you're signing bigger and bigger enterprises, is it fair to say that most of them are coming online initially at that kind of $500,000 ACV metric that you call out for the larger deals? Or do they actually start sometimes smaller? Thanks a lot.",Joseph Vafi,4392927
,,,,
17653,Question-and-Answer,"It is a range. And it's a little bit part of what we do. We can do anything from a small launch. And so, there's a company that says, I want to get into subscriptions and not really sure how. ",Tien Tzuo,4392927
,,,,
17654,Question-and-Answer,"Look, let's put an idea together, let's launch something. Typically, you find that that you've got pent-up demand in your customer base because of the power of your brand, the power of your customers. And you'd be pleasantly surprised by the success of the launch. All the way to, look, I've already got the subscription business, right, and I've got a $1 billion that I need to move on to your platform. That's going to be the foundation for my growth going forward. And so, you're going to see deal sizes really range quite a bit as a result. And I think that's the power of the pricing capability. And quite frankly, that's the power of subscription businesses, cloud businesses in general, right? The ability to size the usage and the size the consumption to [indiscernible] the company wants to start with, but have a path to grow with them over time to be worth seven digits or more. ",Tien Tzuo,4392927
,,,,
17655,Question-and-Answer,It looks like we have time for one more question. And that will be from Scott Berg from Needham. ,Operator,4392927
,,,,
17656,Question-and-Answer,"Congrats on a good quarter. First of all, Tien, you talked about kind of the recovery of the business. I guess just more zooming out a little bit, if you look at the deals that you signed recently and that are maybe in pipeline over the next couple quarters, is the composition of those deals or those transactions any different than maybe how customers would buy the Zuora Central Platform pre-pandemic?",Scott Berg,4392927
,,,,
17657,Question-and-Answer,"Scott, as you know, we have been seeing that if we add a little bit more flexibility from a standpoint of being able to start, as Tien said earlier, start with a small launch or do something larger, and I think this quarter, we saw that we certainly had a nice traction with some deals starting larger.",Todd McElhatton,4392927
,,,,
17658,Question-and-Answer,"As a quick follow-up, Todd, you'd mentioned your subscription revenues were 80% of the overall revenue mix for the quarter. 80/20 certainly is a good level and healthier than what we've seen historically out of the company. But with the push to partners, what should that mix be going forward? Is 80/20 kind of the plateau level here? Or do you actually see that mix progressing further? ",Scott Berg,4392927
,,,,
17659,Question-and-Answer,,Scott Berg,4392927
,,,,
17660,Question-and-Answer,"I don't know that we've given specific guidance on where we see that, but I can certainly see it going lower. I think it's certainly really important for us to have a healthy SI community. As they build practices, we're happy for them to take the SI work on. And also, it gives us an opportunity to continue to build to build the pipeline, which we saw really good traction from this quarter. So, from my perspective, I can certainly see it going longer term below the 20% services. ",Todd McElhatton,4392927
,,,,
17661,Question-and-Answer,"So, now, I will turn the call back over to management for any final remarks. ",Operator,4392927
,,,,
17662,Question-and-Answer,"I want to thank everybody for joining us in the Q3 earnings call. And with that, I will close the session. Thank you very much. ",Tien Tzuo,4392927

,,,,
17675,Presentation,"Thank you, Rob. Thanks everyone for joining us.",Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17676,Presentation,Before I cover the results and highlights of our second quarter just a quick update regarding our response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The aggressive and decisive actions that we took at the start of the year to ensure the health and safety of our employees and that I detailed on our last call are all still in effect.,Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17677,Presentation,"Because of the hard work and dedication of our employees, who have been extremely diligent in following our safety protocols, we have been able to continue safely operating our business in this challenging environment.",Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17678,Presentation,,Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17679,Presentation,"Turning now to our financial performance during the second quarter. Our quarterly revenue of $249 million more than doubled the prior year period, and marks the second consecutive record breaking quarter for our 168 year old company.",Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17680,Presentation,Q2 net income of over $49 million drove $0.87 of GAAP EPS and $0.93 of non-GAAP EPS generated over $55 million in cash from operations and has allowed us to end the quarter with zero net debt.,Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17681,Presentation,"Our operations and logistics teams produced and shipped over 626,000 units during the three month period exceeding last quarter's record numbers by 43,000 units and demonstrating once again the power of our unique flexible manufacturing model and more importantly our dedicated teams ability to deliver strong performance in the face of any challenge.",Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17682,Presentation,We are also proud to say that during these extremely difficult times when so many of our fellow Americans are out of work Smith & Wesson created and filled 287 new jobs just in our second quarter and along with our existing employees each of these new team members played a critical role in achieving our record breaking numbers.,Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17683,Presentation,"Our success in the quarter is a direct representation of the trust that our loyal consumers have placed in the iconic Smith & Wesson brand and bodes very well for the long-term success of the company as we continue to gain significant market share as measured by our performance against NICS. But before I go through those numbers as always, two quick notes.",Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17684,Presentation,"First, please remember that adjusted NICS background checks are generally considered to be the best available proxy for consumer firearm demand at the retail counter. But since we transfer firearms only to law enforcement agencies and federally licensed distributors and retailers and not to end consumers, NICS generally does not directly correlate to our shipments or market share in any given time period, we believe mostly due to inventory levels.",Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17685,Presentation,"That said given the continued lack of inventory in the channel throughout our second quarter, we believe that NICS is currently more correlated to our shipments then it would be during periods when the inventories are not so depleted.",Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17686,Presentation,"Secondly, as you may recall, we are providing more insight into our business and specifically market share trends by sharing with you the quarterly channel inventory levels at our strategic retailer accounts and distributors. Please remember that we have three main consumer channels and the inventory levels I will discuss do not include buying groups.",Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17687,Presentation,"So with that let's go into the market share numbers. In our fiscal Q2, overall NICS background checks for all firearm types increased 57.5% over the comparable time-frame last year. For Smith & Wesson, our total unit shipped into the sporting goods channel during this time increased 93.4% to 586,000 units while simultaneously our SRA and distributor combined inventory levels declined by over 208,000 units. Breaking those numbers down a little further, NICS checks for handguns increased 75.6% during the quarter, while our handgun unit shipped increased by 74.3% to 420,000 units. Simultaneously, our handgun channel inventory dropped by 178,000 units.",Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17688,Presentation,"And finally NICS checks for long guns increased 48.8% in the quarter while our long gun units shipped increased 167.7% to 166,000 units. Simultaneously, our long gun channel inventory dropped by 30,000 units. So in addition to our terrific financial results, these numbers indicate very robust market share gains as well, which as we've discussed previously is the key metric in our focus on long-term growth.",Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17689,Presentation,Our shipments into the channel significantly exceeded NICS overall. While inventory of our products in the channel actually decreased reflecting our ability to deliver and a strong preference for our product at the retail level.,Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17690,Presentation,,Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17691,Presentation,Before I hand the call over to Deana I just want to provide a longer-term perspective on the overall firearm market dynamics that we've all seen this past year. Including the recent November NICS results released this week in calendar 2020 through November 30th there have been approximately $19.2 million background checks for firearms purchases.,Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17692,Presentation,This represents a year-to-date growth of 65% over the prior year and the largest 11 month period on record since FBI began tracking NICS in 1998. With NSSF predicting that 40% of the firearms purchases in 2020 are coming from first time firearm owners we can estimate that there were nearly 8 million Americans who made the decision in 2020 so far to exercise their second amendment rights for the first time.,Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17693,Presentation,"Additionally, these new consumers are broadening and diversifying our consumer base. With NSSF survey data indicating that women are making up 40% of new buyers and overall firearm purchases by African Americans are outpacing all other demographics with 58% growth in the first half of the year alone through June.",Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17694,Presentation,"So what does this mean for our company and our industry. In October, we conducted an attitude and usage study of over 1,200 law abiding firearm owners, with the goal of gaining a better understanding of today's firearm consumer.",Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17695,Presentation,"The research indicated that for those people who own firearms, the average number of firearms possessed was eight. And according to research conducted by NSSF in 2013, at that time, approximately one in four new firearm owners went on to purchase additional firearms. With the subsequent purchase at a higher sales price than their initial purchase.",Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17696,Presentation,"Therefore this expanded consumer base of new firearm owners represents a healthy long-term opportunity for the industry as a whole, but specifically for Smith & Wesson. A&U study also concluded that once again the iconic Smith & Wesson brand was number one in unaided awareness in the handgun and MSR categories and again number one in aided awareness with 84% of respondents recognizing our brand. Most encouraging, however was that 85% of respondents would recommend Smith & Wesson to others.",Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17697,Presentation,"An endorsement that we do not take for granted and one that combined with our results in the first half of our fiscal year positions us very favorably within the marketplace long-term. Finally and as I mentioned on the last call, we have taken a leadership position in welcoming these new consumers to our community through our Smith & Wesson gunsmarts program.",Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17698,Presentation,"We continue to produce instructional videos and distribute free safety kits and to-date we have donated over 47,000 gunsmarts kits complete with hearing and eye protection, basic safety and storage instructions, as well as links for the consumer to find our YouTube channel where we share roughly 40 videos with content ranging from shooting fundamentals, responsible gun ownership, safety, storage and enjoyment of the shooting sports. In just four months since its inception, we have received over 24 million impressions on this program. Please visit www.smith-wesson.com/gunsmarts to see the program tools for yourself.",Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17699,Presentation,And with that I'll turn the call over to Deana to deliver the financial results.,Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17700,Presentation,Thanks Mark.,Deana McPherson,4392925
,,,,
17701,Presentation,"The ongoing heightened consumer demand combined with our ability to increase our production capacity through use of our flexible manufacturing model resulted in a second consecutive quarter of record revenue totaling $248.7 million, a $135 million increase or more than double the prior year results.",Deana McPherson,4392925
,,,,
17702,Presentation,"Once again these results are a testament to our operations team that increased firearms production output beyond our expectations, utilizing a combination of targeted headcount increases additional machine capacity, and continued activation of our flexible manufacturing model. All while keeping our employee safe during the pandemic.",Deana McPherson,4392925
,,,,
17703,Presentation,,Deana McPherson,4392925
,,,,
17704,Presentation,"Gross margin of 40.6% well above the 28.2% realized in the prior year was due to increased unit shipments combined with a reduction in promotional activity slightly offset by recall related costs, increased depreciation on machinery purchases and compensation related costs associated with the increased headcount.",Deana McPherson,4392925
,,,,
17705,Presentation,"Operating expenses were $8 million higher than the prior year due to $4.8 million of spin-off costs, $3.1 million of increased profit sharing expense and a $500,000 donation to the National Shooting Sports Foundation's",Deana McPherson,4392925
,,,,
17706,Presentation,Gun Vote campaign. Increased volume related customer allowances were more than offset by reduced travel lower advertising costs and lower employee medical costs likely due to the deferral of elective procedures resulting from the pandemic.,Deana McPherson,4392925
,,,,
17707,Presentation,"The increase in revenue in gross margin led to a significant profit gain as compared to the prior-year comparable quarter including net income of $49.1 million, GAAP earnings per share of $0.87, non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.93 and adjusted EBITDA of $78.9 million.",Deana McPherson,4392925
,,,,
17708,Presentation,"During the quarter, we generated $55.3 million in cash from operations and spent $8.7 million on capital equipment, leaving $46.6 million in free cash. We also see that the outdoor products and accessories business with $25 million and repaid the final $25 million on our revolving line of credit, resulting in the company, ending the quarter was $55.5 million of cash and no bank debt.",Deana McPherson,4392925
,,,,
17709,Presentation,"As you may remember from our call last quarter, we indicated that our capital allocation priorities are to invest in our business, repay our debt and return capital to our shareholders. I'm pleased to announce that our Board has once again authorized our $0.05 per share dividend to shareholders of record on December 17th with payment to be made on January 5th.",Deana McPherson,4392925
,,,,
17710,Presentation,Looking forward although we do not intend to provide guidance. We will provide the following color for our third quarter. We implemented a 3% price increase that went into effect on November 16th. This increase applies to nearly all products shipped subsequent to November 15th.,Deana McPherson,4392925
,,,,
17711,Presentation,"In periods of high demand our ability to recognize revenue is primarily a function of our production capacity. That production capacity is somewhat governed by the number of operating days we have available due to weekend, holidays and other non-operating days such as shutdown. Our second quarter had 59 operating days with five shutdown days and one holiday.",Deana McPherson,4392925
,,,,
17712,Presentation,"Our third quarter will have only 56 operating days due to the Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday shutdown periods. During our 12 week second quarter, we increased our capacity by over 50% with nearly half of this increase occurring at the start of week four and two-thirds in place at the start of week six. We are not currently planning to add any significant additional capacity beyond this.",Deana McPherson,4392925
,,,,
17713,Presentation,In fact we have been monitoring our supply chain due to recent indications that the pandemic is now starting to impact some supplier's ability to supply us with material we need to meet our very aggressive production plans. We continue to monitor the situation and are actively working to mitigate any disruption. Finally due to the increase in our taxable income. Our effective tax rate has dropped to just below 25%.,Deana McPherson,4392925
,,,,
17714,Presentation,With that operator can we please open the call to questions from our analysts.,Deana McPherson,4392925
,,,,
17715,Question-and-Answer,[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Scott Stember from CL King. Your line is now open.,Operator,4392925
,,,,
17716,Question-and-Answer,"I know you guys aren't giving guidance of any sort but just looking at where you see the industry going forward. I know we have a new foundational layer of growth then it seems like things are a lot different this time around versus prior surges, but just give us your sense of could 2021 at least for the industry be a year of growth and how would supply issues play into preventing that from happening?",Scott Stember,4392925
,,,,
17717,Question-and-Answer,,Scott Stember,4392925
,,,,
17718,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. Scott this is Mark. Yes, I mean, obviously we're not giving guidance. So I'm not going to get too much into detail about whether it's a growth year or not, but what I will say is, as I said in the prepared remarks, it's - I mean there is obviously a lot of new firearms consumers in the industry now and all indications are that anywhere between a quarter to a third those are going to become long-term enthusiasts.",Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17719,Question-and-Answer,"And as we mentioned that tends to bode very well for us going forward as enthusiasts become collectors and move up in the ASP that their subsequent purchases are oftentimes a lot more than their initial purchase. Where the market is going and while we're not giving guidance I think you can kind of take from some of Deana's comments about the number of production days that the demand is very strong, remains very strong and the inventory in the channel is still very depleted.",Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17720,Question-and-Answer,"We expect this to continue at least through our Q3 and into our Q4 and we'll see where it goes from there. But as I said I mean we're really taking a long-term view of this. I think we've got it, as you said, we've kind of put a new layer on in terms of the consumer base.",Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17721,Question-and-Answer,"And could you, Deana, just go back and talk about or recap what you mentioned about supplier issues? How that could potentially you know how serious is it and how could that - what kind of headwind could that be in the next couple of quarters?",Scott Stember,4392925
,,,,
17722,Question-and-Answer,"Sure. We don't really expect any disruptions to our current plan. This is more a situation where we have to be flexible, things come up, COVID numbers are going up. There's a lots happening across the country right now.",Deana McPherson,4392925
,,,,
17723,Question-and-Answer,"And at this point we are flexible enough to change things around and that we can react to them, but it is something that we're monitoring closely and I want to make sure that everybody considers that in how we look at the future- right now - and it is part of the reason that we don't want to be out there providing guidance.",Deana McPherson,4392925
,,,,
17724,Question-and-Answer,"It's a situation where we manage and our operations team and our procurement teams have done a great job and our suppliers have been behind us, but it is something that we're actively managing.",Deana McPherson,4392925
,,,,
17725,Question-and-Answer,Got it.,Scott Stember,4392925
,,,,
17726,Question-and-Answer,"Scott, this is Mark. I don't think it's going to I mean I don't think it's going to have any impact in our quarter and, but I think it's more a factor of, I think, we're going to take a little bit of - we ramped obviously as you can see from the numbers we ramped really quickly.",Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17727,Question-and-Answer,"And we're going to take a little bit of a - we're going to pause here for a little bit and let them let the supply chain stabilize and then we'll see where the market goes from there. Obviously, we've got upside, but and we've proven we can manage through any kind of normalization that may come at some point in the future. But so we're just kind of pausing here to let the supply chain stabilize a little bit I think is kind of what you should take away from that.",Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17728,Question-and-Answer,"And just lastly we have the first two quarters of fiscal '20 regarding adjusted EPS. I don't know if you guys are prepared to give anything on a quarterly basis, but could you give us for the full year at least for fiscal '20. So we could have a framework to judge fiscal '21 off of obviously '21 is a lot higher but?",Scott Stember,4392925
,,,,
17729,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, we're not giving guidance, there's just too many variables and we want to manage for the long-term.",Deana McPherson,4392925
,,,,
17730,Question-and-Answer,"No. I'm not referring to guidance, but for 2020 we do not have what fiscal '20 what the?",Scott Stember,4392925
,,,,
17731,Question-and-Answer,You want to know what.,Deana McPherson,4392925
,,,,
17732,Question-and-Answer,Yes.,Scott Stember,4392925
,,,,
17733,Question-and-Answer,I understand. You want to know what EPS is for continuing operations.,Deana McPherson,4392925
,,,,
17734,Question-and-Answer,Yes. Just so we could have something to judge basically to base '21 off of. That's all. Yes.,Scott Stember,4392925
,,,,
17735,Question-and-Answer,,Scott Stember,4392925
,,,,
17736,Question-and-Answer,Sure. One moment. It's about $0.50 for the full year fiscal '20.,Deana McPherson,4392925
,,,,
17737,Question-and-Answer,You said 50?,Scott Stember,4392925
,,,,
17738,Question-and-Answer,"50, yes.",Deana McPherson,4392925
,,,,
17739,Question-and-Answer,Our next question comes from the line of Steve Dyer from Craig-Hallum. Your line is now open.,Operator,4392925
,,,,
17740,Question-and-Answer,Congratulations on the excellent results. A couple of questions. One long gun performance was really exceptional in the quarter by almost any measure. I think it's by far the biggest quarter I've ever seen. You clearly don't have really much if any shotgun exposure. So I'm wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on what may have driven that whether it was ARs whether it was feel like there was more hunting rifles et cetera?,Steve Dyer,4392925
,,,,
17741,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, we don't - we typically have - we don't provide that kind of break down, Steve, unfortunately. I think every category in the firearms industry right now is very, very strong. Our Thompson/Center Arms was above expectations. But to be honest our Thompson/Center Arms is in terms of the brands out there is kind of one of the smaller brands in the industry.",Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17742,Question-and-Answer,And so you can kind of draw your own conclusions from that and our - and on our MSR side that is one of our most volatile. It's just one of the most volatile categories in the portfolio just in general in the industry. Obviously it's very subject to political rhetoric and tends to have wild swings.,Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17743,Question-and-Answer,"We're very, very used to that. Our supply chain is very, very used to that and we've been through this before and we're able to ramp-up very quickly. We're also able to absorb any kind of normalization very well as well and we don't make a whole lot of those components, they are supplied from the outside. So from us from an absorption perspective it doesn't really affect us.",Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17744,Question-and-Answer,But just in general I think it's safe to say that was if you feel like there was more personal protection sale as opposed to hunting sale in the long gun category?,Steve Dyer,4392925
,,,,
17745,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, I think, the dynamics that happen I think as the years gone on, it was very, very heavy obviously as we came into the pandemic in March and April very heavily focused on personal protection and through the summer and then as we kind of came into as the election kind of heated up through September and October and obviously that gun control became a topic of discussion then the MSRs really kind of have heated up just in recent months.",Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17746,Question-and-Answer,Yes. You guys talked about expanded production capacity in the quarter. I'm wondering if you could tell us sort of how much of that added capacity was internal versus external?,Steve Dyer,4392925
,,,,
17747,Question-and-Answer,"We're not going to provide any kind of details on that, but as we've talked about many times before our main mode of operation when it comes to managing through surges and ups and downs as we have a base level of capacity, which we feel is largely rightsized internally, and then we manage these kind of the heavier demand periods through outsourcing with the outside. So I can kind of give you that direction, so.",Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17748,Question-and-Answer,And Steve you can take a look at cash flow statement and you can see our capital spending is not outsized. So that will kind of guide you in the direction.,Deana McPherson,4392925
,,,,
17749,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, yes very helpful. And then I guess lastly for me and I'll hop back in line. Your free cash flow is extraordinary and has turned the net debt situation around very, very quickly. You have a dividend although it's probably fairly I guess nominal in the big picture, but when you look at whether it's share buybacks, whether it's a special dividend I think any further sort of guidance as to especially given another couple of quarters of this kind of cash flow, how you might think about that in the future?",Steve Dyer,4392925
,,,,
17750,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, we've said before that and it is our intention to return our profits back to our shareholders. At this point, we do want to be a growth dividend company and we know that we started out at a relatively small level. What we don't want to do is grow the dividend so fast that it becomes unsustainable when there is a lot of volatility in the marketplace.",Deana McPherson,4392925
,,,,
17751,Question-and-Answer,,Deana McPherson,4392925
,,,,
17752,Question-and-Answer,"So that is one piece of it. We are continuing to evaluate what to do. We recognize that the last two quarters of free cash have been very positive, but our goal is to manage for the long-term and we don't want to make rash decisions so stay tuned. We'll - when a decision gets made we'll let everyone know.",Deana McPherson,4392925
,,,,
17753,Question-and-Answer,Our next question comes from the line of Mark Smith from Lake Street Capital. Your line is now open.,Operator,4392925
,,,,
17754,Question-and-Answer,"I wanted to talk a little bit about ASP going forward and just confirm you guys took a 3% price increase in the middle of November. Do you feel like that was as much as you could take, are you being conservative in that maybe talk about what's you're seeing in the environment as far as pricing?",Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17755,Question-and-Answer,"Sure. So the ASP is up largely because just due to the fact that the promotional activity is non-existent right now. So and you know obviously there is some mix adjustments that we can make and so to maximize that ASP going forward. Just speaking real quickly about the 3% price increase. We again take a pretty long-term view to our pricing, could we have gone higher in this environment.",Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17756,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, of course, we could have, but we're taking a long-term view to the marketplace and maintaining credibility with the consumer and we want our products to be priced appropriately in the marketplace, not just in this environment, but in any environment, so versus our competition. So we took a hard look at that, there were some categories that we took some targeted increases beyond the 3% just to kind of bring those back in line.",Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17757,Question-and-Answer,It's an opportunity right now and the demand is still strong. And so I think going forward at least through the rest of our fiscal year I think it's pretty safe to say that these ASPs are going to hold up.,Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17758,Question-and-Answer,The next opportunity be and kind of the next question is as we look at the calendar without SHOT Show really happening in person this year. How does the calendar change? And as we look at new products is there opportunity to maybe spread out release of new products and take price strategically in new products?,Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17759,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, that's a great question. So we're continuing to push hard on new products. There are a couple that we've just strategically decided to kind of leave on waiting in the wings for now. There is also a couple of that we're going to be really excited to be talking about next time we speak.",Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17760,Question-and-Answer,"So we're continuing to remain very aggressive and I guess we're kind of taking the view of let's take this opportunity now to be pushing hard so that. So again, in any environment, we can continue to be successful and injecting life and excitement into our brands through new product launches.",Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17761,Question-and-Answer,"So I'm actually very excited about the new product pipeline that we have coming up here in the next 12 months to 18 months. So and yes, you're right, I mean, that's something we can definitely use to help offset any kind of pricing pressure is new product and it's something we spend a lot of time talking about and planning for.",Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17762,Question-and-Answer,"And then, Mark, you talked a fair amount about kind of brand loyalty and awareness. As we look at these new and first time buyers. Any insight into kind of how the brand helped you maybe take share with these new buyers. And then additionally if we get a little more granular. Do you think the easy models within handgun really helped you drive sales to some of these first-time buyers?",Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17763,Question-and-Answer,"The answer to both of those questions. The answer to your last question is absolutely. The easy is all feedback in the marketplace right now from all of our retailers, distributors, et cetera, is the number one product hands down in the marketplace right now and a lot of it is due to the fact that it just caters to those - to exactly what somebody who is new coming into the marketplace is looking for.",Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17764,Question-and-Answer,,Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17765,Question-and-Answer,"In terms of the brand, yes, I think the brand really did help a lot. I think we in the industry are very familiar with all of the major players. I think people outside of the industry definitely no Smith & Wesson and then maybe know a few of the other larger players.",Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17766,Question-and-Answer,So Smith & Wesson is just such a - such an iconic brand in American Heritage that when somebody is coming in new it's a trusted welcoming brand to see that under the - to see that brand and I think we've done a great job of keeping our product in stock maybe better than some others in the industry and that's really helped us as well to make sure that we're there and that consumer is making that first purchase and that brand association with Smith & Wesson.,Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17767,Question-and-Answer,And then just two more from me. As we look at gross profit margin that certainly looks solid. Are there any pressures that you guys see that could impact that's going forward primarily as we look at the labor market or commodities anything to call out?,Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17768,Question-and-Answer,Nothing on the commodity side. The labor market is frankly has been tough and we've - all credit to our operations and human resources teams that really haven't - hasn't - haven't had any issues with that. I don't expect it to have any material impact going forward on our gross margins. So but it is a challenge for us right now believe it or not because we are growing so quickly.,Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17769,Question-and-Answer,"We did see our ability to hire improve after the additional unemployment benefits expired depending on whether there is a new agreement that could have an impact on hiring or quite frankly people who might not, might want to just be out, but at this point, we have a good flow of really great workers and so we're doing the best we can to keep up with that. As Mark noted in his call we hired 287 people during the quarter. That's a lot.",Deana McPherson,4392925
,,,,
17770,Question-and-Answer,Absolutely. Last one from me is any insight you can give us on as far as kind of backlog of orders and where you're sitting that today?,Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17771,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, we don't provide the backlog on a quarterly basis, but obviously given the fact that our results we just posted in fact that we're kind of indicating that we're going to be pretty constrained to our third quarter it's strong, it's very strong.",Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17772,Question-and-Answer,Our next question comes from the line of Rommel Dionisio from Aegis Capital. Your line is now open.,Operator,4392925
,,,,
17773,Question-and-Answer,"So a lot of moving parts in the supply chain obviously with the ramp in production new employees as you alluded to. And enough so I mentioned that COVID safety practices as well. I wonder if you could just address? What you guys are doing to ensure quality control and product quality and also just given I'm sure some of these factors are impacting some of your, the companies you outsource some of the production substitute are you seeing any deterioration in terms of product quality from components that you guys are having brought in? Thank you.",Rommel Dionisio,4392925
,,,,
17774,Question-and-Answer,"Sure. Thanks Rommel. No, we are not seeing any material changes. We run a very similar to the automotive industry. We've kind of copied some of - a lot of their quality control processes and got those implemented.",Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17775,Question-and-Answer,"It's extremely important for us to make sure that obviously it's a firearm and we want to make sure that it's safe as possible and quality and safety go hand in hand as far as that goes. We have a lot of pretty disciplined rigorous processes internally in terms of testing and making sure that all of the product that's going out the door is up to our very, very high standards. So, no, we have not seen any of that issue - any of those issues.",Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17776,Question-and-Answer,"We actually have a every one of the sales folks does a bi-weekly report where one of the main questions we ask is safety, sorry, is quality and any reports coming from the field. So we can watch trends and we watch a lot of our own internal metrics in terms of warranty returns and scrap rates had on the floor et cetera and we have not seen any kind of increase whatsoever.",Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17777,Question-and-Answer,,Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17778,Question-and-Answer,Our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr from Cowen. Your line is now open.,Operator,4392925
,,,,
17779,Question-and-Answer,"This is Scott McCrery on for Cai. I had two questions. First, have you seen firearm purchasing behavior change at all during the elections whether it'd be from a consumer standpoint. I know you also feel consumers directly, but have you heard of anything or have you seen anything with dealers and distributors?",Scott McCrery,4392925
,,,,
17780,Question-and-Answer,"Well, obviously, the elections are - any - the election year is a driver for us as the political landscape gets contentious and talk of gun control increases and therefore there's a fear of gun control regulation increased gun control regulation, which drives a lot of our consumers to go out and purchase firearms.",Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17781,Question-and-Answer,"So, yes, I mean there is a change in behavior as the election ramped up and as everybody knows this election was obviously one more contentious than maybe they have been in the past. And so I think as we've talked about before though this year was a little different in terms of we had that the personal protection kind of driver fear drivers coming at the beginning of the year and as we kind of went into the spring with the COVID pandemic and then continuing to the social unrest through the summer and that continues really still today yet.",Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17782,Question-and-Answer,And then we layered on top of that I think some of the more typical if you want to call that election demand on top of that. So it - I think it just changed a little bit of the - I mean I don't think it changed at the base level of demand that came out of the personal protection and probably just layered on top of it with the gun control rhetoric.,Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17783,Question-and-Answer,Okay. And then for my second question I know that someone asked this previously but what are your I guess pretty definitely what are your relative priorities when you're thinking about returning cash or using cash you have the dividend now. Is there anything else you're thinking about I guess just trying to understand the hierarchy there?,Scott McCrery,4392925
,,,,
17784,Question-and-Answer,"Yes our hierarchy is, as I said, investing in the business is one of our main priorities and we continue to do that. With regard to returning profits back to shareholders, we do continue to evaluate it.",Deana McPherson,4392925
,,,,
17785,Question-and-Answer,"We are having active discussions at this point regarding what to do. We are not trying to rush into something that will have a long-term negative impact in a business that is quite frankly very, very cyclical. So we will let you know it is not our intention to just store in a tremendous amount of cash that wouldn't do anybody, any good. So give us a little bit more time and we'll let everybody know.",Deana McPherson,4392925
,,,,
17786,Question-and-Answer,Our next question comes from the line of James Hardiman from Wedbush Securities. Your line is now open.,Operator,4392925
,,,,
17787,Question-and-Answer,So a couple from me. I'm interested in the commentary about the new gun owners that are getting into the market and you guys gave us some great stats. Any idea how quickly somebody that as a first time buyer typically takes to sort of get back into the market and get their second or third guy. It seems like that could be a significant driver at some point in the future just trying to think about how long that cycle takes?,James Hardiman,4392925
,,,,
17788,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, James, I think I'd be giving you too much of a guess if I were to kind of answer that question.",Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17789,Question-and-Answer,That's fair.,James Hardiman,4392925
,,,,
17790,Question-and-Answer,"So directionally is it two years, is it one year, is it six months. I think you're probably closer to the six month time frame.",Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17791,Question-and-Answer,Okay.,James Hardiman,4392925
,,,,
17792,Question-and-Answer,"Whether that's one month or six. I don't know, I'd be a little too much guessing to give you an answer there.",Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17793,Question-and-Answer,"That's fair. I think your guess is better than mine. So I appreciate that. So my second question, do you know, you gave us a lot of numbers in terms of the capacity increase. It seems like we can do the math, but I just want to make sure I'm thinking about this is the right way. Your capacity was 50% higher at the end of the quarter then at the beginning, but it was sort of phased in over the course of the quarter. Is that the way to think about it?",James Hardiman,4392925
,,,,
17794,Question-and-Answer,,James Hardiman,4392925
,,,,
17795,Question-and-Answer,Yes more toward the front half of the quarter then the back half.,Deana McPherson,4392925
,,,,
17796,Question-and-Answer,Yes.,James Hardiman,4392925
,,,,
17797,Question-and-Answer,That's what I was trying to get across is that the ramping did do - did come early and you got to remember too that quarter is a 12-week quarter for us because the first week is shutdown. So we did definitely ramp more toward the front end of the quarter. So that you just can't take that and assume that the next several quarters is going to be that much more additive.,Deana McPherson,4392925
,,,,
17798,Question-and-Answer,"Right. I get that. Okay and then just lastly and the answer maybe - we don't really know, but as I think about the substantial decrease in inventories. I think it was 208,000 units in aggregate between the two channels that you guys laid out. Anyway to put that in context of what the restocking opportunity now is. I guess part of the answer to that question is the year ago number sort of where you want it to be too high, too low.",James Hardiman,4392925
,,,,
17799,Question-and-Answer,"But I think what a lot of people are now going to try to figure out is how long does it take you to get back to ""normal"". I doubt you're going to answer that, but any sort of bread crumbs to help us figure out what that restocking looks like?",James Hardiman,4392925
,,,,
17800,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, I can help a little bit. I mean I think we'll let you know that our inventory levels in the channel right now are right about one week worth of supply and really all that is the time it takes our partners to get the truck get backed in unloaded, picked and shipped back out again. We want that as we've talked about many times before kind of our target level inventory in the channel we want it to be about eight weeks. So as well I think so, yes, there is a significant opportunity there, eight weeks worth of supply.",Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17801,Question-and-Answer,So I think that's - I think what's the little bit different even this time around as we - in addition to the layer - the additional layer of new consumers. We also - we got to refill the entire channel. So you're right. Just we're thinking about that there is a significant work to do just to get the channel back up to where we want it to be.,Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17802,Question-and-Answer,Got it. Much appreciate it. Thanks guys.,James Hardiman,4392925
,,,,
17803,Question-and-Answer,"Thanks. One other point. If you're thinking about the way that the marketplace reacted after the 2016 election that was where inventory was in the channel and consumer start buying. In this case, there is no inventory in the channel and consumers are still buying.",Deana McPherson,4392925
,,,,
17804,Question-and-Answer,"So as consumers potentially slow down in the future at some point, we will have the opportunity to see the inventory as it moves through the channel and work with the distributors and retailers. So it should be a softer slowdown not like it wasn't '16. This is a very different environment.",Deana McPherson,4392925
,,,,
17805,Question-and-Answer,Our next question comes from the line of Mark Smith from Lake Street Capital. Your line is now open.,Operator,4392925
,,,,
17806,Question-and-Answer,Just one quick follow-up on timing. This year it should look like we didn't really see any Smith & Wesson or Thompson/Center Arms out on Black Friday specials. Historically with the timing of shipments for those kind of specials would that go in the October quarter and be shipped and typically booked at quarter or would that fall under the January quarter?,Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17807,Question-and-Answer,"We're just talking about Black Friday quickly. The feedback we've gotten unanimously from the retailers is there is a very few of them who felt the need to run promotions. And as a matter of fact, a lot of the feedback has been that Black Friday was not as big as at some previous years have been just frankly because they didn't have any inventory and they a lot of the feedback we got was Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday of Thanksgiving week.",Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17808,Question-and-Answer,"We're very, very busy days and Thursday was actually sorry and then Friday was actually a little bit of a down-day and Saturday and Sunday picked up. And I don't know if that's because of the COVID fear of being out Black Friday shopping or whether that's just the inventory was depleted and people went shopping Monday through Wednesday or what the case close, but. So I think it's a bit of a different year and in terms of the promotional and again there really isn't any promotional activity in the channel right now and everything that we're making we're shipping.",Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17809,Question-and-Answer,,Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17810,Question-and-Answer,All right. And generally the way that you would think about like how do we promote our products and the timing of when we promote our products. We don't generally promote products for Black Friday.,Deana McPherson,4392925
,,,,
17811,Question-and-Answer,So when the fact that we are not promoting and it's increased the ASPs wouldn't have fallen into any quarter as it relates to Black Friday if generally speaking as you know that our fourth quarter is generally the higher promotional period because of the different shows and the different distributor shows and buying group shows and whatnot.,Deana McPherson,4392925
,,,,
17812,Question-and-Answer,"We generally would have promoted more in the summer timeframe as our distributors and dealers were stocking up for their later periods, but generally speaking within our financial statements, the back half of the second quarter and the front half of our third quarter didn't generally have a significant number of promotions, generally speaking.",Deana McPherson,4392925
,,,,
17813,Question-and-Answer,And outside of promotions as far as kind of inventory that's on hand in a historical year it's not like you would build into and ship a bunch in the last week or so of October just to prepare for the holidays. There is nothing?,Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17814,Question-and-Answer,No.,Deana McPherson,4392925
,,,,
17815,Question-and-Answer,Historically that's happened that way?,Mark Smith,4392925
,,,,
17816,Question-and-Answer,"No, no that's not really how it operates generally speaking to that distribution would kind of take a little bit of time for it to get through to the retailer. So there is not a big push generally in October to get inventory onto the shelves for Black Friday.",Deana McPherson,4392925
,,,,
17817,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you. At this time, I'm showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Mark Smith for closing remarks.",Operator,4392925

,,,,
17832,Presentation,"Building on the momentum we saw at the end of the second quarter third quarter comp store sales declined 8.9%. The mid single-digit comp declines we experienced in August continued through September, with October sales impacted by our decision not to repeat certain promotional activity from last year.",Mary Dillon,4392919
,,,,
17833,Presentation,,Mary Dillon,4392919
,,,,
17834,Presentation,"As we discussed on our last earnings call, we are working to optimize promotional events to remain competitive, while also improving profitability. In the third quarter, we executed several promotional events that drove strong guest engagement and profitable sales.",Mary Dillon,4392919
,,,,
17835,Presentation,"We launched our first ever We Love Our Members Event to reengage and welcome Ultamate Rewards members back to Ulta Beauty, having completed our phase store reopening process.

,,,,
17838,Presentation,"Now turning to our performance by category, we continue to increase our market share across most major prestige beauty categories.

,,,,
17839,Presentation,"From our proprietary consumer insights work, we know most beauty enthusiasts are maintaining or expanding their skincare routines as a form of self-care.

,,,,
17841,Presentation,"Fragrance and bath was our strongest category this quarter, delivering double-digit comp growth, driven by newness, exclusive and unique Ulta Beauty programs.

,,,,
17849,Presentation,"As expected, with stores opened for the full quarter, store traffic trends improved and e-commerce growth moderated from trends we saw in the first half of the year.

,,,,
17851,Presentation,"Although trends improved from the second quarter, sales from our Services business were down more than 30% in the third quarter, primarily due to a decline in transactions. Average ticket was higher, reflecting pent-up demand for cut, color and style services.",Mary Dillon,4392919
,,,,
17852,Presentation,"At the end of the quarter, we had 31.7 million active members in our Ultamate Rewards Program, essentially flat with second quarter and about 6% lower than the third quarter last year.

Now importantly, retention rates among our platinum and diamond members who are most engaged with our brand remained very strong.",Mary Dillon,4392919
,,,,
17853,Presentation,"We continue to see an increase in members shopping with us online. As we have discussed before, omnichannel members are our most engaged and most productive members, historically spending 3 times more per year than store-only guests.

This quarter, we increased our use of propensity modeling to help reactivate members and we continue to strengthen our ability to optimize offers in email and online, enabling us to maximize the return on select promotions.",Mary Dillon,4392919
,,,,
17873,Presentation,"Our fifth and final strategic priority is to drive holistic cost optimization. We continue to work to create a more cost-efficient store labor model. As we discussed on the last earnings call, we made the difficult decision to eliminate two store leadership roles, the salon manager and the prestige manager and created a new service manager role responsible for services, events and prestige retail. Effective November 1st, this new structure creates a stronger linkage between services and products.",Mary Dillon,4392919
,,,,
17874,Presentation,"This quarter, we also made another difficult decision to suspend our expansion to Canada. This was not an easy decision to make and in no way reflects a lack of confidence in the international growth opportunity for Ulta Beauty.",Mary Dillon,4392919
,,,,
17875,Presentation,"Our teams work diligently to position us for a successful entry into Canada next year and I am proud of what they accomplished in such a short period of time. However, after much consideration, we determined that prioritizing our efforts to strengthen and grow our U.S. operations must be our top priority in the current operating environment.",Mary Dillon,4392919
,,,,
17876,Presentation,"So these are just a few of the examples we have taken to adjust our model to reflect the challenges and opportunities we see today. We have also maintained significant limitations on corporate hiring and controllable expenses, and we continue to look across the enterprise for additional ways we can optimize our cost structure, while also investing in new capabilities to support future growth. We have made a lot of progress in pursuit of our strategic priorities, which positions us to drive continued market share growth in the fourth quarter and beyond.",Mary Dillon,4392919
,,,,
17877,Presentation,"Certainly, 2020 has been a year like no other and it?s difficult to predict exactly what the holiday season will bring this year, with shop safe standards in all stores and enhanced digital shopping options, our teams are ready to meet our guests wherever and however they want to shop with us this holiday season.",Mary Dillon,4392919
,,,,
17878,Presentation,"We are encouraged by the sales trends we have seen so far in the quarter, but uncertainty remains as we navigate ongoing disruption from the resurgence in the virus and continued economic uncertainty.",Mary Dillon,4392919
,,,,
17879,Presentation,"As we execute through this holiday season, our top priorities are to reengage existing members and capture new guests with relevant content, compelling offers and unique products and also to deliver engaging omnichannel experiences.",Mary Dillon,4392919

,,,,
17883,Presentation,"Building on newness and exclusives introduced earlier this year, we have launched several new brands just in time for holiday season.

The full assortment will be available in early 2021.",Mary Dillon,4392919
,,,,
17884,Presentation,"In makeup, we are excited to welcome Hourglass, a cruelty-free luxury beauty brand to the Ulta Beauty family. And while we offer Chanel fragrances in stores, we are excited to announce we have recently launched Chanel fragrances on ulta.com for holiday gifting and beyond.",Mary Dillon,4392919

17885,Presentation,,Mary Dillon,4392919
,,,,
17886,Presentation,"To help our guests give the best gift this year, we have introduced a new digital gift guide, including a three-step quiz to inspire and help find the perfect gift and for those who prefer to give gift cards, we have expanded our designs to include more inclusive options and we have expanded our distribution in third-party outlets as well for added guest convenience.",Mary Dillon,4392919
,,,,
17887,Presentation,"In anticipation that more guests will utilize digital channels this season, we have made curbside and BOPIS pickup easier than ever. These enhancements combined with the investments we have made to increase our ship-to-home capacity position us well to deliver a great omnichannel experience this holiday season.",Mary Dillon,4392919
,,,,
17888,Presentation,"The operating environment continues to be dynamic and challenging. As COVID-19 prevalence increases so our market-specific government restrictions resulting in some reductions in operating hours, limitations on in-store capacity, and in some cases, mandated store closures. Our priority is to ensure the safety and well-being of our associates, guests and brand partners, and we will continue to monitor the situation closely and adjust our operations as needed.",Mary Dillon,4392919
,,,,
17889,Presentation,"Now before I turn the call over to Scott, I want to highlight the exciting new partnership I am sure you have all read about. In 2021, Ulta Beauty will partner with another powerhouse retailer, Target Corporation to disrupt the retail industry and redefine how guests experience beauty.",Mary Dillon,4392919
,,,,
17890,Presentation,"Next fall, we will introduce Ulta Beauty at Target, a shop-in-shop experience online and in select Target locations. With 1,000 square feet of space, Ulta Beauty at Target will offer a curated assortment of established, emerging and prestige brands across multiple categories.",Mary Dillon,4392919
,,,,
17891,Presentation,"Our vision is to create an extension of our welcoming Ulta Beauty experience with dedicated Target team members trained to provide elevated service and offer deep product expertise with a dedicated space that inspires trial and discovery. Leading into the power of our respective loyalty programs, we intend to reward guests with benefits across both programs for all purchases made within the shop.",Mary Dillon,4392919

Ultimately leading to more members as well as greater spend per member.",Mary Dillon,4392919
,,,,
17895,Presentation,"Expanding our omnichannel capabilities to more deeply connect with guests is a strategic priority for us. We believe this new channel will create more opportunity to drive demand for the full beauty experience for discovery, services and play available in all Ulta Beauty stores.",Mary Dillon,4392919
,,,,
17896,Presentation,"Importantly, we will be able to leverage our robust CRM capabilities to engage guests who shop Ulta Beauty at Target with targeted personalized communications to highlight and enhance their total Ulta Beauty experience.",Mary Dillon,4392919
,,,,
17897,Presentation,"In closing, we know guests are changing how they shop for beauty, but their engagement with the category remains strong. In fact, the role of beauty is more important now than ever. In this new normal, beauty has become more than makeup more than product.",Mary Dillon,4392919
,,,,
17898,Presentation,"Today, beauty is a critical link to acts of self-care and wellness, and is a well-loved brand with a diverse assortment and a wide range of price points, outstanding service offerings and knowledgeable and passionate associates, Ulta Beauty is well-positioned to lead and shape how guests experience beauty in this new normal.",Mary Dillon,4392919
,,,,
17899,Presentation,,Mary Dillon,4392919
,,,,
17900,Presentation,"And now, I will turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of the financial results. Scott?",Mary Dillon,4392919
,,,,
17901,Presentation,"Thanks, Mary, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate your support of Ulta Beauty and hope you and your loved ones are staying safe and healthy. I will reiterate Mary?s comments and thank all of our dedicated associates for their tireless efforts in safely serving our guests and keeping our operations running smoothly during this difficult time.",Scott Settersten,4392919
,,,,
17902,Presentation,"I will begin with the income statement. Net sales for the quarter declined 7.8% and total company comp declined 8.9%. Given the challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic, we are very pleased with this performance, as topline results for the quarter were better than our internal expectations.",Scott Settersten,4392919
,,,,
17903,Presentation,"Average ticket increased 7.6%, primarily driven by an increase in units per transaction, while transactions declined 15.4%. We experienced nice conversion in both channels, but continued to be impacted by softer traffic to stores.",Scott Settersten,4392919
,,,,
17904,Presentation,"As expected, e-commerce growth slowed relative to the second quarter, but continued to deliver very strong growth versus last year. Our e-commerce operations delivered a comp increase of 90% for the quarter, as guests continue to take advantage of our omnichannel capabilities. Buy online, pickup in store was strong again this quarter, totaling about 16% of e-commerce sales, approximately double the penetration in the third quarter last year.",Scott Settersten,4392919
,,,,
17905,Presentation,"From a mix perspective, makeup was 45% of sales, down 600 basis points from last year, skincare, bath and fragrance collectively increased 500 basis points to 26% of sales, haircare products and styling tools increased 300 basis points to 21% of sales, while the services category was down 200 basis points to about 4% of sales. As Mary indicated, our service business continued to be negatively impacted by COVID-related capacity constraints.",Scott Settersten,4392919
,,,,
17906,Presentation,"Gross profit margin was 35.1%, a decline of about 200 basis points, compared to 37.1% a year ago. Similar to what we have seen since the onset of the pandemic, the largest driver of gross margin deleverage was fixed cost due to lower sales. I would note that the trend improved from what we experienced in the second quarter, due to the stronger sales trend.",Scott Settersten,4392919
,,,,
17907,Presentation,"Channel shift was also a large contributor to gross margin deleverage again this quarter, albeit less than we experienced in the second quarter, as stores were open for the entire quarter. These headwinds were partially offset by an increase in merchandise margin, which was primarily driven by our lower promotional activity, as well as continuing benefits from our efficiencies for growth or EFG efforts.",Scott Settersten,4392919
,,,,
17908,Presentation,"SG&A expenses decreased to $416.4 million, compared to $449.2 million in the third quarter of last year. The largest driver of the decrease was lower store payroll and benefits, as we reduced investments in labor to reflect lower demand. Store expenses were also lower as we adjusted and managed to softer traffic in stores.",Scott Settersten,4392919
,,,,
17909,Presentation,"Marketing expense was also lower year-over-year, reflecting reduced spend on print, offset by higher investment in digital channels. These reductions more than offset a modest increase in corporate overhead and PPE and COVID-related expenses. The increase in corporate overhead primarily reflects higher compensation and benefit expense, partially offset by investments to support strategic growth initiatives made last year.",Scott Settersten,4392919
,,,,
17910,Presentation,"As a reminder, in the third quarter of last year, incentive compensation expense decreased versus the prior year, reflecting financial performance that was below targeted levels, as well as a lower stock price.",Scott Settersten,4392919
,,,,
17911,Presentation,"This quarter, we recorded a charge of $23.6 million for impairment, restructuring and other costs. As Mary mentioned earlier, we suspended our planned expansion to Canada, resulting in a $15.9 million charge related to long-lived asset impairments, lease termination costs and severance. Our teams continue to wind down this effort and we now expect to incur between $30 million to $40 million of Canada exit expenses in fiscal 2020.",Scott Settersten,4392919
,,,,
17912,Presentation,,Scott Settersten,4392919
,,,,
17913,Presentation,"In the third quarter, we also recorded $5.7 million in severance associated with the elimination of the salon manager and prestige manager roles, and recorded $2 million of lease termination costs related to the previously announced permanent closure of 19 stores.",Scott Settersten,4392919
,,,,
17914,Presentation,"Pre-opening expense was $4.2 million in the quarter, a decrease from $6.5 million a year ago. We resumed new store openings in early August and opened 17 stores in the third quarter, compared to 31 new stores a year ago. Interest expense related to the drawdown of our revolver totaled $1.4 million, compared to interest income of $900,000 a year ago.",Scott Settersten,4392919
,,,,
17915,Presentation,"Diluted GAAP earnings per share was $1.32, compared with $2.25 reported for last year?s third quarter. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, excluding charges related to impairment, restructuring and other costs was $1.64, compared to $2.23 a year ago, which excludes stock compensation and other tax credits.",Scott Settersten,4392919
,,,,
17916,Presentation,"Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow. For the quarter, total inventory decreased 11% compared to the third quarter last year and inventory per store decreased 12.5% year-over-year, as we adjusted to recent demand trends and reduced holiday receipts.",Scott Settersten,4392919
,,,,
17917,Presentation,"To maintain flexibility and manage inventory risk, we have reduced our exposure to limited edition holiday sets and are leaning more into core product. We ended the quarter with $560.9 million in cash and cash equivalents.",Scott Settersten,4392919
,,,,
17918,Presentation,"At the beginning of the pandemic, we drew down $800 million on our $1 billion revolver and suspended our stock buyback program as precautionary measures to increase liquidity. Reflecting on our confidence that we have sufficient liquidity to support our operations and investment priorities, we repaid $800 million of borrowings that were outstanding under the facility on September 2nd.",Scott Settersten,4392919
,,,,
17919,Presentation,"We remain confident in our ability to generate strong cash flow and we may resume our stock buyback program this quarter, depending on market and operating conditions. We currently have $1.58 billion remaining under our current repurchase authorization.",Scott Settersten,4392919
,,,,
17920,Presentation,"Turning now to the rest of 2020. The overall operating environment remains uncertain and it continues to be difficult to forecast our business with precision. Therefore, we are not providing EPS guidance at this time. However, I want to provide some color on how we are thinking about the fourth quarter.",Scott Settersten,4392919
,,,,
17921,Presentation,"We are encouraged by the sales results for November. However, the operating environment continues to be dynamic and it is difficult to predict how the effects of the pandemic, including any lockdowns or restrictions may impact consumer demand through the rest of the quarter.",Scott Settersten,4392919
,,,,
17922,Presentation,"As such, we now expect our fourth quarter comps to be in the range of down 12% to 14%, slightly better than the expectation of mid-teen comp declines we shared on our last earnings call.",Scott Settersten,4392919
,,,,
17923,Presentation,"Two call outs as you think about your models. As Mary shared, we have realigned our store management structure to create a more cost efficient store model. As a result of these changes, we will see a reduction of salon payroll and cost of goods sold, and an increase in-store payroll and SG&A relative to last year.",Scott Settersten,4392919
,,,,
17924,Presentation,"Second, we expect to incur $15 million to $20 million of PPE and COVID-related expenses in the fourth quarter. Overall, we expect SG&A dollars in the fourth quarter will be similar to last year?s levels.",Scott Settersten,4392919
,,,,
17925,Presentation,"We continue to adjust our capital spending plan. Our updated plan for 2020 is to invest between $150 million and $160 million in capital expenditures, including approximately $65 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures, $65 million for supply chain and IT, and about $25 million for store maintenance and other.",Scott Settersten,4392919
,,,,
17926,Presentation,"We expect to open approximately 30 new stores and relocate five stores in 2020. We are still finalizing our plans for next year, but continue to expect to open at least 30 new stores in 2021. We remain confident in the long-term opportunity to continue to expand our store fleet.",Scott Settersten,4392919
,,,,
17927,Presentation,,Scott Settersten,4392919
,,,,
17928,Presentation,One final comment. We recognize that our long-term profitability potential is top of mind with investors and I want to take this opportunity to reiterate our confidence that Ulta Beauty is a double-digit margin business.,Scott Settersten,4392919
,,,,
17929,Presentation,"However, given the uncertainty and lack of visibility as to when the operating environment will stabilize and recover from the pandemic, it is difficult to say with certainty when we will return to double-digit margins.",Scott Settersten,4392919
,,,,
17930,Presentation,"To start, we have healthy product margins and our merchant teams continue to work to improve merchandise margins as we expand and enhance our assortment, through both negotiation efforts as well as EFG opportunities.",Scott Settersten,4392919
,,,,
17931,Presentation,"As sales stabilize and return to growth, we will be able to leverage fixed costs. In addition to our ongoing EFG efforts, our real estate team is capturing significant benefits from lease renegotiation efforts, reflecting the market impacts of COVID-19 and these efforts will help us reduce occupancy costs over the longer term.",Scott Settersten,4392919
,,,,
17932,Presentation,"Although, e-commerce will likely continue to be a headwind to overall EBIT margins, we are improving e-commerce profitability as we increase utilization of BOPIS, leverage size and scale with growth and get closer to our guests through the expansion of our supply chain network and we see additional opportunities to mitigate rate impacts in the future.",Scott Settersten,4392919
,,,,
17933,Presentation,"As we discussed on our last earnings call, we continue to make progress on our journey to strengthen the effectiveness and profitability of our promotions and we are actively taking steps in the near-term to right-size our cost structure in the new operating environment. Longer term, we are also working to identify additional opportunities across the enterprise to optimize our cost structure, while also supporting investment to support growth capabilities.",Scott Settersten,4392919
,,,,
17934,Presentation,"And now, I will turn the call back over to the Operator to moderate the Q&A session.",Scott Settersten,4392919
,,,,
17935,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Erinn Murphy with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.,Operator,4392919
,,,,
17936,Question-and-Answer,"Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. My question, Mary, is for you on the Target partnership. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about the brand selection process and the inventory buying process between both Target, as well as Ulta? And then how do you intend to integrate the Ultamate Rewards Program at Target from a technology perspective? Thank you. ",Erinn Murphy,4392919
,,,,
17937,Question-and-Answer,"Great. Thank you. Well, let me just start about the fact by reiterating, we are very, very excited about the partnership. We have got a strong business model and track record to start with and feel very confident about our long-term growth prospects, and of course, we are really thrilled to unlock even more excitement for guests and growth with our Target partnership.",Mary Dillon,4392919
,,,,
17938,Question-and-Answer,"Just to recap, we are thrilled. It?s an amazing retailer. Brian Cornell is a fantastic CEO and they have got a fantastic team. These are two very strong retail brands that are loved by consumers and the concept of Ulta Beauty inside Target, nine out of 10 people loved it, complementary brand DNA and team DNA.",Mary Dillon,4392919
,,,,
17939,Question-and-Answer,"And of course, I think, we both bring very different strengths to the equation from Ulta, it?s our beauty authority, our best-in-class understanding of the beauty category, and for Target, certainly, the scale of Target and the millions of that we will discover Ulta Beauty at Target is a huge benefit for us as well, as well as their omnichannel capabilities.",Mary Dillon,4392919
,,,,
17940,Question-and-Answer,"As we think about bringing this forward, I think, our brand -- we are early in the process with our brand negotiations and discussions. So a lot of positive, a lot of enthusiasm, I think, as a category and for brands. It?s a great new platform for growth and for new customers, millions of new customers who discover brands and so we feel very optimistic about that.",Mary Dillon,4392919
,,,,
17941,Question-and-Answer,,Mary Dillon,4392919
,,,,
17942,Question-and-Answer,Target will own the inventory and that -- I think we have talked about that publicly. So that?s what we really own the brand relationships and that?s part of the partnership that we developed from the start.,Mary Dillon,4392919
,,,,
17943,Question-and-Answer,"Early on in terms of integration of technology, but certainly a very important part of this is that our -- is that the customers that participate in the Ulta Beauty at Target will be able to earn -- will be able to sign up, if they are not currently members in Ultamate Rewards, if their Ultamate Rewards members earn loyalty points, as well as Target loyalty points and then for Ultamate Rewards, redeem those at Ulta Beauty. So we think that?s a critical part as we think about the way to really create a flywheel here that works -- creates the win, win, win, I?d say, for guests and for Ulta Beauty and for Target.",Mary Dillon,4392919
,,,,
17944,Question-and-Answer,Great. That was very helpful. All the best.,Erinn Murphy,4392919
,,,,
17945,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. ,Mary Dillon,4392919
,,,,
17946,Question-and-Answer,Our next question is from Joe Altobello with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.,Operator,4392919
,,,,
17947,Question-and-Answer,"Thanks. Hey. Good afternoon. So first question, in terms of the experience that you guys had in October, you mentioned comps were down mid-singles in August, September and saw a little bit of a down draft in October given the fact that you guys didn?t repeat a promotion you did last year. Was that different from what you expected, and I am curious did it cause you guys to rethink your promotion strategy as we head into the holiday season? Thanks.",Joe Altobello,4392919
,,,,
17948,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. I would say, it?s not -- wasn?t a surprise. I mean, we made a very specific decision to pull back some level of promotion and adjust it without the promotion, of course, the comps are even stronger. So we think it?s an important step and just continuing to refine our promotion strategies to make them be as ultimately profitable as possible, but it?s not a pullback on our ability to be very competitive.",Mary Dillon,4392919
,,,,
17949,Question-and-Answer,"So the holiday season, that we started early because we needed to get people to start early in November, right, given the capacity constraints and we have got a very robust program throughout the holiday season that we think is very competitive. And so far, as I said in the script, we feel good about the results that we are seeing. So I think it played out exactly as we had expected.",Mary Dillon,4392919
,,,,
17950,Question-and-Answer,"And in terms of the guide for Q4, you mentioned the comp down 12% to 14%. It does sound like November was off to a fairly decent start. So maybe help us understand why you are assuming a pretty significant slowdown in December?",Joe Altobello,4392919
,,,,
17951,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. Well, stepping back, again, we are pleased with the momentum that we are seeing in the demand signals are strong and we did -- feel good about how we started in November. It?s a pretty simple answer to your question, we are in the middle of this unprecedented pandemic and as you know, we just reached peak levels of hospitalizations yesterday in the U.S. So it?s uncertain.",Mary Dillon,4392919
,,,,
17952,Question-and-Answer,"Certainly, we know we are set up well. Our e-commerce business is performing extremely well. Our stores are doing a great job. But there?s uncertainty about what will happen, I guess, I?d say as we get closer to the holiday in terms of store traffic and that would be true for everybody.",Mary Dillon,4392919
,,,,
17953,Question-and-Answer,"So we are just trying to meet the guests where they are, be pragmatic about this. Certainly, the news about the vaccine is positive, but there?s many difficult weeks ahead. So we feel good, but we are also being cautious about the uncertainty that?s going to we think play out in the next several weeks and few months.",Mary Dillon,4392919
,,,,
17954,Question-and-Answer,Understood. Okay. Thank you.,Joe Altobello,4392919
,,,,
17955,Question-and-Answer,Our next question is from Oliver Chen from Cowen. Please proceed with your question.,Operator,4392919
,,,,
17956,Question-and-Answer,"Hi. Thank you. The e-commerce growth continues to be outstanding, but it decelerated from prior amazing quarters. So what are you seeing there in terms of category performance and what?s happened in different areas of growth in that business? I would also just love more details on Ultamate Rewards in that number count and how that may trend and what?s under your control in terms of keeping the member count at or above 31.7%? Thank you.",Oliver Chen,4392919
,,,,
17957,Question-and-Answer,,Oliver Chen,4392919
,,,,
17958,Question-and-Answer,"Sure. Well, Oliver, that?s a three pronged question. That?s impressive. And I will -- maybe Dave and I will tag team a little bit. E-commerce traffic and comp, we -- we are very pleased with how that?s going. And in fact, expected it to moderate somewhat as we open up stores and that -- we like that.",Mary Dillon,4392919
,,,,
17959,Question-and-Answer,"It?s -- obviously, as people are coming back to stores, historically, what we have seen. Omnichannel guests are our best guests, because they add the e-commerce purchase on top and really spend 3 times as much as somebody who would store only. So as we opened up stores, expected to see some moderation of e-commerce demand but it?s still up 90% last quarter. So we feel very good about that.",Mary Dillon,4392919
,,,,
17960,Question-and-Answer,"In terms of, I think the second part of your question was about category performance on e-comm, which Dave will be happy to take and then we can just get into Ultamate Rewards at the end and the three pronged question.",Mary Dillon,4392919
,,,,
17961,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. Oliver, category performance on e-comm really mirrors the total company performance that we highlighted in the script. So strength across skincare, haircare, bath, fragrance, exceptionally strong and continued challenges, although some bright spots in makeup. So nothing different about our e-commerce business versus our store from a category standpoint with real strength and growth coming outside of the makeup category, so we are pleased with that.",Dave Kimbell,4392919
,,,,
17962,Question-and-Answer,"As it relates to the -- our loyalty program, I will just start with saying, we are really remain incredibly proud of what we believe is one of the best loyalty programs in all of retail and even with some of the challenges we faced this year, we know our guests continue to love the program. They are highly engaged in that program. Our brand partners continued to find a lot of value through the access and the insights that they get by engaging in that program.",Dave Kimbell,4392919
,,,,
17963,Question-and-Answer,"Our elite guests, our diamond and platinum guests are still highly engaged. It is working at a very high level, and we are really glad that we -- we have always been glad to have it and we certainly have been happy to have that as part of our arsenal this year as we face this unprecedented times.",Dave Kimbell,4392919
,,,,
17964,Question-and-Answer,"But, yes, we did see a decline this year, primarily due to store closures. That hurts our new member conversion and it also impacts retention, because as you know, while our e-commerce business is growing and we have a significant increase in penetration of our member base at our e-commerce, it?s still a majority store-based user loyalty program and some of those guests, particularly the least engage the non-elite guests, we have seen a bit of a hit on retention with those lease tenured guests.",Dave Kimbell,4392919
,,,,
17965,Question-and-Answer,"Importantly, as I think Mary mentioned in the script, our retention with our most tenured guests, the platinum and diamond, remains very strong, and we are seeing a lot of strong performance in that.",Dave Kimbell,4392919
,,,,
17966,Question-and-Answer,"So, with nearly 32 million members, we are -- we feel like it?s still very strong and we are focused on reactivating guests, continuing to drive strong engagement with our engaged guests and those elite guests.",Dave Kimbell,4392919
,,,,
17967,Question-and-Answer,"But as a reminder, we do calculate loyalty -- the number of our loyalty program over rolling 12 months. And so as each month goes by, we are still lapping a pre-COVID period through this -- through the next several months.",Dave Kimbell,4392919
,,,,
17968,Question-and-Answer,"So, we are working hard to reengage our guests, but we are continuing to be lapping a period where we weren?t facing the challenges, particularly in our store fleet. So, we are anticipating some challenges with our less tenured guests for a little while, but focused on retaining them and seeing strength as we emerge out of this in 2021.",Dave Kimbell,4392919
,,,,
17969,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. Congrats on target. Best regards.,Oliver Chen,4392919
,,,,
17970,Question-and-Answer,Thank you.,Mary Dillon,4392919
,,,,
17971,Question-and-Answer,"Thanks, Oliver.",Dave Kimbell,4392919
,,,,
17972,Question-and-Answer,Our next question is from Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.,Operator,4392919
,,,,
17973,Question-and-Answer,,Operator,4392919
,,,,
17974,Question-and-Answer,"Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. So I guess, Scott, just going back to some of the commentary that you provided for guidance for Q4. I was curious, if you can provide maybe the puts and takes for gross margins? And then related to that, I just want to get a sense of what you guys are seeing right now in the promotional environment during the holiday season?",Rupesh Parikh,4392919
,,,,
17975,Question-and-Answer,"All right. Thanks, Rupesh. So first, I think with fourth quarter, it?s important to keep in mind what the sales guidance is. So again, we expect a softer topline in Q4 versus Q3. Again, that?s compared to last year?s trends, right? So that comes with inherent margin pressure, generally speaking.",Scott Settersten,4392919
,,,,
17976,Question-and-Answer,"We anticipate gross margin to leverage in Q4 similar to Q3 levels, with many of the same drivers that we have seen through the last couple of quarters, primarily deleverage of fixed cost in the stores and across the supply chain, on lower sales volumes and then we are going to have some nice offsets with improving merchandise margins similar to what we saw in Q3.",Scott Settersten,4392919
,,,,
17977,Question-and-Answer,"I guess as long as I am talking about margins, I will just pivot over to SG&A as well. Just as a reminder, we have made some comments in the call about the shift in the payroll, right, from related to the services manager going from cost of goods sold down to SG&A. So that?s something to keep in mind as you update your model.",Scott Settersten,4392919
,,,,
17978,Question-and-Answer,"And just a little bit more color there, so we expect -- in SG&A we do expect more deleverage in Q4 versus Q3, with the pressure being from store payroll and benefits as we ramp up store labor again and make sure we deliver excellent guest experience during the holiday season and then some increasing store expenses primarily due to the COVID and PPE-related costs.",Scott Settersten,4392919
,,,,
17979,Question-and-Answer,"Lastly there, I?d say on the advertising or marketing side, there was a shift. We talked about this earlier in the year. So marketing is going to be heavier in the fourth quarter as we go into holiday. We view that as opportunistic spend versus what we saw earlier in the year.",Scott Settersten,4392919
,,,,
17980,Question-and-Answer,"Then on your promotional question for the holidays. Of course, as we have talked about, before holiday is always a very promotional timeframe for every retailer. And we see it as not just competing against other beauty retailers, but really other categories as well as competing for the gift-giving occasions.",Dave Kimbell,4392919
,,,,
17981,Question-and-Answer,"So naturally, we see an increase in promotionality. We also, as Mary mentioned have -- we have pulled up our promotions and changed the cadence a bit and we are seeing that across the category as well as more effort to spread promotional activity around to give guests more opportunities to feel more comfortable shopping both in store and online to manage their gift-giving in personal occasions.",Dave Kimbell,4392919
,,,,
17982,Question-and-Answer,"Overall, we see it as competitive. We have seen some competitors be a bit more promotional. We have seen brands a bit more aggressive in some limits time offers in their DTC. I wouldn?t classify that as a dramatic or radical shift in promotionality, and as always, we are watching the market very closely.",Dave Kimbell,4392919
,,,,
17983,Question-and-Answer,"We have got great tools in place. We feel like the efforts we have implemented so far this holiday season, this quarter have been effective and we are confident in the promotional plans that we have both leading up through the rest of Christmas and then post-holiday as well. So we feel good about the position and certainly managing and monitoring it on a daily basis.",Dave Kimbell,4392919
,,,,
17984,Question-and-Answer,"And Rupesh, I just want to clarify, I did mean deleverage. So gross margin deleverage in Q4 versus Q3 same with SG&A.",Scott Settersten,4392919
,,,,
17985,Question-and-Answer,Okay. Great. Thank you and best of luck for the holidays.,Rupesh Parikh,4392919
,,,,
17986,Question-and-Answer,Thanks.,Dave Kimbell,4392919
,,,,
17987,Question-and-Answer,Our next question is from Simeon Siegel with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.,Operator,4392919
,,,,
17988,Question-and-Answer,,Operator,4392919
,,,,
17989,Question-and-Answer,"Thanks. Hi, everyone. I hope you and your families had a nice and safe holiday weekend. Maybe a little higher level, Mary or Dave, I guess, pandemic might be a weird time to ask this, but how are you thinking about where you are in terms of the Target -- your Target customer share of wallet versus where you have told us historically? And then maybe any views you have on how the selling landscape might change post pandemic? So just thinking about potentially shrinking department stores, but growing online beauty, maybe DTC brands, big box, et cetera. Just any of the changes you are seeing there? And then, Scott, did you say what you expect to save from Canada next year? Thank you.",Simeon Siegel,4392919
,,,,
17990,Question-and-Answer,"Okay. Thank you. Another three pronged question. Starting with the broader environment, I would say, we are always in a strategic planning mode, right? Looking around the corners, thinking about the future, looking at what?s happening with consumer behavior, channel behavior, competitive behavior. There?s no question about that.",Mary Dillon,4392919
,,,,
17991,Question-and-Answer,"The pandemic has accelerated many things that were on the horizon anyways, and certainly, increased e-commerce shopping, no surprise, disruption in some physical shopping, which is coming back and we think there?s a bit of a shakeout -- maybe accelerated shakeout in terms of who the winners and losers will be long-term in terms of retail format.",Mary Dillon,4392919
,,,,
17992,Question-and-Answer,"So part of what we -- a big part of what we do is think about how can we meet guests in new ways and new channels, new formats to meet them where they are going to be. And that has been a strategy for us already, which is increasing our omnichannel capabilities, so whether it?s BOPIS, curbside, e-commerce, shipping capacity, digital tools.",Mary Dillon,4392919
,,,,
17993,Question-and-Answer,But we certainly -- that?s another great opportunity for us with the Target partnership is to really disrupt at a time that there is disruption happening and accelerate the opportunities for us to drive growth through accessing new customers in new omnichannel way.,Mary Dillon,4392919
,,,,
17994,Question-and-Answer,"So DTC brand, certainly, there?s strength in that segment as well. We think overall, e-commerce will be bigger than it would have been it?s been pulled forward. I think we all know that. But we see that our customer in this category also still really wants the in-store shopping experience and so, that?s kind of exciting for us, as we are always thinking about what that store of the future and experience of the future would look like.",Mary Dillon,4392919
,,,,
17995,Question-and-Answer,"And frankly, I am very happy that we had digital tools available like GLAMlab to immediately pivot to virtual try-on for makeup and now skincare in a way that is very helpful right now. So, I think we are well-positioned given the shifts. I don?t think the shifts aren?t done. I think we just have to assume that we have to continue to look around corners for new shifts and opportunities. Share of wallet, do you want to add that?",Mary Dillon,4392919
,,,,
17996,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. I?d just say, certainly, it?s -- as you said in your question, a really disrupted time to try to measure consumer dynamics and so we are watching closely on, share of wallet. What we do know is we continue to gain share and we talked about this, I think, in previous calls and discussions, gaining share on the prestige side, we are across categories within prestige, makeup, skincare, haircare. We have seen that consistently.",Dave Kimbell,4392919
,,,,
17997,Question-and-Answer,"As we talked in previous calls, we lost -- we feel like we lost some share as our stores were shut earlier in the pandemic in the mass side. And our mass competitors remained open, which would imply a bit of a short-term hit on share of wallet. But we are seeing that business strengthen and performed really well in Q3 and so confident in that.",Dave Kimbell,4392919
,,,,
17998,Question-and-Answer,"So we are going to wait for the dust to fully settle on 2020 to really assess the impact of share of wallet. What we do know is we came into this pandemic with real momentum and strength across categories and price points, gaining share, gaining share of wallet, gaining customer growth. There?s been disruption. But we think our model, as Mary said, is quite strong. We think we are very well-positioned to accelerate out of this and continue the path of driving growth and share across all dimensions.",Dave Kimbell,4392919
,,,,
17999,Question-and-Answer,,Dave Kimbell,4392919
,,,,
18000,Question-and-Answer,"And then, finally, on the Canada piece, we haven?t really quantified any element of the Canadian expansion plans here over the last couple of years we have been talking about this. So I -- suffice it to say, it?s a start-up investment like a lot of other things and there is typically some deleverage that comes along with that during the early phases. That wasn?t -- so we will avoid that next year, obviously, by not moving ahead with that.",Scott Settersten,4392919
,,,,
18001,Question-and-Answer,"But back to Mary?s comments, that?s not the reason why we stepped away from that. I mean, it was just a question of, what were the highest priorities and where should we be focusing our efforts in light of all the disruption we are dealing with these days.",Scott Settersten,4392919
,,,,
18002,Question-and-Answer,Great. Thanks so much guys and happy holiday season.,Simeon Siegel,4392919
,,,,
18003,Question-and-Answer,Thank you.,Mary Dillon,4392919
,,,,
18004,Question-and-Answer,Thanks Siegel.,Dave Kimbell,4392919
,,,,
18005,Question-and-Answer,"Operator, I think, we have time for one more question.",Kiley Rawlins,4392919
,,,,
18006,Question-and-Answer,Sure. And our last question would be from Mark Altschwager with Baird. Please proceed with your questions.,Operator,4392919
,,,,
18007,Question-and-Answer,"Hi. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, a two-pronged one related to stores. Maybe just first is, with respect to the store opening plans, you mentioned at least 30 next year, I mean, what are the factors you are considering today that would most impact the final plan for 2021 and is there a scenario where you could get back to something closer to the prior cadence? And then just second part just related to Target. From a store perspective, I mean, if that partnership is successful, does it change your view on the longer-term store Target for Ulta? Thanks.",Mark Altschwager,4392919
,,,,
18008,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. So I guess maybe I will go to the last piece of that first. So, no, it doesn?t change our outlook really on that range that we have been talking about and reaffirming over the last few years. So, 1,500 to 1,700 stores in the U.S. We still feel comfortable that, that?s very doable range even with the new Target announcement here recently.",Scott Settersten,4392919
,,,,
18009,Question-and-Answer,"So as you can well imagine, real estate being one of our core competencies. This has been on the front burner, just thinking about the impact to store growth in the future and how -- what changes this might drive us to. So we don?t see any big pendulum swing with respect to that. Although that?s something we will keep our eyes on, right, as we move down the pathway with the Target team.",Scott Settersten,4392919
,,,,
18010,Question-and-Answer,"And so as far as next year, the cadence, so, yes, at least 30 stores, markets partly related to our ability to work with our landlord partners. I mean, you know a lot of these leases. We are working years in advance, right? So there are signed leases and commitments to move forward with certain projects.",Scott Settersten,4392919
,,,,
18011,Question-and-Answer,"So again, we are re-looking at all of those, all the signed agreements that we have and all the others that are in the queue, just to make sure we are making good decisions and going on with the best of the best kind of locations that we feel very confident in. So it?s a thoughtful process, but we feel like we have got really great capabilities there analytically, and our real estate team is best-in-class. So we feel confident in the future.",Scott Settersten,4392919
,,,,
18012,Question-and-Answer,"Yeah. I will just going to add one thing to Scott?s answer, which is, on top of it, the way that we thought about the Target partnership, I?d say, is really an amplifier to our business model. As Scott said, we believe we can still build out the number of stores that we have mapped out and this yet gives us yet another point of distribution, a way to reach millions of new guests with a trial and discovery version of Ulta Beauty, right, that we amplify back to the Ulta Beauty full business model as well and so as we map out the future of those locations plus our store locations working in partnership with Target to make this a win for everybody.",Mary Dillon,4392919
,,,,
18013,Question-and-Answer,,Mary Dillon,4392919
,,,,
18014,Question-and-Answer,Thank you and happy holidays.,Mark Altschwager,4392919
,,,,
18015,Question-and-Answer,Thank you.,Mary Dillon,4392919
,,,,
18016,Question-and-Answer,And we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mary Dillon for closing remarks.,Operator,4392919
,,,,
18017,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you for joining us today. I?d like to close by thanking all of the Ulta Beauty associates across our stores, distribution centers and offices with their truly relentless effort to navigate through this challenging environment, while also working hard to get our stores, website and DCs ready for the holiday season. We know this holiday season will be like no other, but our team is ready and excited to help our guests see the joy of the season. And we hope that you, your colleagues and your loved ones stay safe and healthy. Look forward to speaking to all of you again in March when we report our fourth quarter and full year results. Thank you.",Mary Dillon,4392919

18020,Presentation,"I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Mr. Ashish Saran, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.",Operator,4392917
,,,,
18021,Presentation,"Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Marvell?s third quarter fiscal year 2021 earnings call. Joining me today are Matt Murphy, Marvell?s President and CEO; and Jean Hu, our CFO.",Ashish Saran,4392917
,,,,
18022,Presentation,"I would like to remind everyone that certain comments made today may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management?s current expectations. Please review the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our earnings press release, which we filed with the SEC today and posted on our website, as well as our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings. We do not intend to update our forward-looking statements.",Ashish Saran,4392917
,,,,
18023,Presentation,"During our call today, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures is available on our website in the Investor Relations section.",Ashish Saran,4392917
,,,,
18024,Presentation,"With that, I?ll turn the call over to Matt for his comments on our performance.",Ashish Saran,4392917
,,,,
18025,Presentation,"Great. Thanks, Ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. The third quarter was an exciting and exceptionally busy time for the Marvell team, as we hosted our 2020 Investor Day, and soon after announced plans for our transformational acquisition of Inphi. These were both significant events which continued to generate strong interest from the financial community.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18026,Presentation,"So before I discuss our quarterly results, let me summarize the growth strategy we articulated at our Investor Day, and the benefits we expect to drive from the combination with Inphi. During our Virtual Investor Day, we discussed the importance of choosing the right end market, building a larger base of key customers, and driving technology platform leadership aligned with the most exciting growth drivers in the industry. We discussed our focus on the data infrastructure market, a $110 billion total semiconductor opportunity for Marvell, of which we are currently servicing $16 billion, and that we expect to grow 50% faster than the TAM over the next few years.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18027,Presentation,"We showcased the expansion we expect to drive in our base of Tier 1 $100 million plus customers to a total of 13 over the next couple of years. We outlined the evolution of our technology roadmap to being first to market with the 5-nanometer platform for portfolio wide leadership. We concluded with our compelling long-term growth vision focused on 5G, cloud, and automotive end markets.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18028,Presentation,"At the event, we also disclosed the number of new design wins, which we believe will contribute meaningfully towards revenue growth over the next several years. In 5G, we announced the second customer for OCTEON and the radio head, as well as two additional base station customers for Ethernet products. In the enterprise market, we announced a broader footprint for our Ethernet switches and PHYs at two Tier 1 North American networking OEMs.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18029,Presentation,,Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18030,Presentation,"One of these OEMs also selected our next generation 5-nanometer OCTEON processors to replace their current x86 Solutions across their entire enterprise router platforms. In our storage business, we won a cloud datacenter, DIY SSD controller and announced a new Tier 1 NAND OEM for our merchant SSD controllers.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18031,Presentation,"Consistent with the strategy we discussed at Investor Day, on October 29, we announced our plans to combine with Inphi in a highly complementary and strategic transaction and expected to accelerate our growth and leadership in the fast-growing cloud and 5G markets.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18032,Presentation,"We discussed multiple benefits expected to result from this merger, including a larger and faster growing addressable market, a broadening of our Tier 1 cloud customer base, greater scale for our 5- and 3-nanometer platforms, an exceptionally talented SerDes team, and an even stronger long-term financial model. We also discussed significant opportunities for cross selling, which would represent upside to the target operating model.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18033,Presentation,"Since the announcement, we have been able to discuss the benefits of this merger with employees, customers, partners, and shareholders of both companies. These discussions have further strengthened our conviction in all the key strategic elements of this exciting transaction.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18034,Presentation,"We've had the opportunity to meet with a broader cross section of Inphi employees and continue to be highly impressed with their depth of technical capability, focus on innovation, and seamless program execution. The Marvell and Inphi teams are well aligned from a cultural perspective with many shared values and core beliefs.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18035,Presentation,"Similar to the approach we've taken in our prior acquisitions, we are looking forward to integrating Inphi employees across all levels of the combined company. I can already sense that the sales, product management, and engineering teams on both sides are chomping at the bit so they can start driving new revenue growth opportunities.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18036,Presentation,"Let's dig a little deeper into these opportunities, which we expect will result from the strong positions established by Marvell in 5G and Inphi and cloud. We believe that having a leading product at the heart of the customer's architecture is critical as it sets the cadence of technology adoption and pulls along additional products into the full solution. We saw this play out effectively following the Cavium acquisition, and you are all now familiar with the significant increase in content and customer expansion we were able to drive in 5G, as a combined company.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18037,Presentation,"In base stations, the front, mid, and backhaul connectivity is primarily optical. And with the emergence of 5G, the speed and bandwidth of these links needs to increase substantially. Inphi?s high performance PAM4 and coherent DSP-based electro-optics solutions are perfectly aligned to deliver these higher speeds. We believe that Marvell's leadership in embedded processors for 5G infrastructure will better position Inphi to participate in the optical conductivity opportunity.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18038,Presentation,"In cloud, Inphi?s electro optics platform is critical to data center architecture, and they have established direct relationships with the industry's largest cloud infrastructure providers. Inphi's recent results and guidance illustrate the benefits of having a strong presence in the cloud market.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18039,Presentation,"For their third quarter of fiscal 2020, they reported revenue growth of 92% year over year, and the organic portion of their business grew 57% year over year. We're excited to see that they expect growth to continue in the fourth quarter with Inphi revenue guided to grow 82% year-over-year at the midpoint.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18040,Presentation,"Marvell also has a growing presence in the cloud market, and merging with Inphi is expected to create multiple $100 million plus cloud customers for the combined company. We expect to drive numerous revenue growth opportunities for ASICs and DPUs with these large cloud customers.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18041,Presentation,,Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18042,Presentation,"Within cloud data centers, we expect compute for AI and other use cases to increasingly require tailored solutions, resulting in an expansion of custom and ASIC opportunities for the combined company.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18043,Presentation,"In cloud, custom compute engines in ASICs are often connected directly to external optics, such as in a machine learning cluster. This presents a unique opportunity for the combined company to tightly integrate optics inside ASICs and custom compute processors through onboard and co-packaged optics solutions. Cloud customers are particularly excited about this capability.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18044,Presentation,"In addition to the ASIC opportunities I just discussed, we expect similar benefits to Marvell's cloud DPU business. Today, Marvell's DPUs or SmartNICs is standard product to cloud customers. In the short-term, we see a greater opportunity to win more business for our existing products. In the longer-term, we can provide higher value DPU solutions with tightly integrated onboard and co-package optics.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18045,Presentation,"Since announcing the deal, we have completed a number of initial meetings with key customers. While any detailed joint roadmap discussions will need to wait until receipt of all regulatory approvals, customer reactions from the meeting so far have been extremely positive, and they have already identified multiple new opportunities for Marvell. In fact, I've been personally involved in a number of these discussions, and I am now even more confident in the potential for new revenue growth opportunities.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18046,Presentation,"Let me move on now to our quarterly results and expectations. Revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 was $750 million, growing 3% sequentially and 13% year-over-year. Stronger than expected revenue growth from our networking business offset weaker than anticipated results from storage. Our GAAP loss per share was $0.03, our non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.25, growing 19% sequentially and 47% year-over-year.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18047,Presentation,"I'm pleased with the growth in revenue and earnings we have been able to drive in the third quarter. We are projecting strong growth in the fourth quarter as demand from customers continues to increase. Our operations team is continuing to ramp production with our global supply chain partners. However, we have begun to experience a number of industry wide supply constraints affecting the type of high complexity products we provide for data infrastructure.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18048,Presentation,"The rapid recovery this year in the semiconductor industry appears to be stressing significant portions of the supply chain. These supply challenges are currently limiting our ability to fully satisfy, the increase in demand for some of our networking products.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18049,Presentation,"Let's now discuss our two businesses in more detail. First in our networking business, revenue during the quarter was $445 million and grew 10% sequentially and 35% year-over-year. Revenue growth was stronger than our expectations of mid to high-single-digit sequential growth and overall this was a very strong quarter across a broad base of our products and end markets including 5G, cloud, automotive and enterprise.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18050,Presentation,"In 5G, we delivered our fifth straight quarter of sequential revenue growth. In the first-half of this year, 5G growth was driven primarily from our ASIC business benefiting from the rapid deployments in China. In the third quarter, while the wireless infrastructure ASIC business remains strong, the sequential growth was driven primarily by standard and semi-custom product shipments to Samsung.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18051,Presentation,"The rollout of 5G outside of China is starting to pick up, and we expect consumer demand for 5G services will continue to grow worldwide, following the launch of new 5G phones from Apple. As we look forward, we expect 5G momentum to accelerate through next year in multiple regions including the U.S. and Japan.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18052,Presentation,,Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18053,Presentation,"Our 5G customer base continues to expand and the second regional customer has selected Marvell's industry leading OCTEON fusion-based NAND processors to power their new 5G base stations. They plan to engage with Marvell on a variety of RAN architectures, including emerging ORAN initiatives, enabling them to flexibly address the needs of network operators regardless of the network topology being deployed.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18054,Presentation,"Let me take a moment to preview Marvell's efforts in the emerging, Open RAN, and virtualized RAN architectures. These are commonly referred to as ORAN and VRAN respectively. Global operators are driving toward open standards-based interfaces with the RAN to enable multi-vendor interoperability. In addition, the use of virtualization to separate hardware and software has begun making its way into the radio access network.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18055,Presentation,"Now, whether virtual or physical, the complexity of 5G processing, real time latency requirements, and the tight power envelope necessitate optimized hardware acceleration to be deployed at scale. We addressed this need with our OCTEON fusion processors, the industry's leading silicon platform for 5G-based band and radio processing. We're adding more capabilities to this proven technology to further optimize it for open virtual environments. We will soon unveil details of our new VRAN accelerator, which is based on OCTEON fusion, designed to support an open and interoperable ecosystem with a full set of ORAN standards-based interfaces.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18056,Presentation,"By adding ORAN and VRAN capabilities to our existing 5G offerings, Marvell will be the ideal semiconductor partner with a complete 5G platform capable of supporting all RAN architectures on common hardware and software framework. This is a critical differentiator for Marvell given that beyond a few Greenfield deployments, most 5G networks will have a complex hybrid architecture to support a diverse set of deployment scenarios. I look forward to discussing the continued evolution of our 5G platform.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18057,Presentation,"Moving on to our ASIC business, we've benefited from a strong ramp in a new cloud program and we are excited about this opportunity. I would note that similar to other cloud programs, we expect purchasing patterns for the new ASIC to be somewhat lumpy with demand fluctuations in any given quarter. We recently announced our 112 gig 5-nanometers SerDes solution that has been fully validated in hardware and is ready for adoption by customers. We believe that this technology with industry leading performance, power is an area will help drive 100 gig as the interconnect of choice for next generation data infrastructure.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18058,Presentation,"Our ASIC business is the first beneficiary of this leading edge IP, and I'm very pleased that we have secured a new custom ASIC design win that will embed our 112 gig SerDes in next generation top of rack and spine switches for leading hyperscale data centers.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18059,Presentation,"Turning to our automotive business, industry production appears to be recovering from COVID-19 impacts earlier in the year. We're also seeing record bookings and have started ramping multiple Ethernet design wins in model year 2021 vehicles. These ramps drove strong revenue growth in the third quarter and we expect growth to continue in the fourth quarter and into fiscal 2022.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18060,Presentation,"In our enterprise end market, we continue to refresh our Ethernet products and recently introduced the second generation of our Octal multi-gig PHY family. These are the newest additions to Marvell's borderless enterprise portfolio, comprehensive set of switches and PHYs architected to address the specific requirements of emerging mobility and cloud applications that are extending the boundaries of the traditional campus environment. The new PHY family offers a clear upgrade path to multi gigabit technology.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18061,Presentation,,Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18062,Presentation,"We believe that an increase in customer interest for our multi-gig products and our recent design win momentum are strong leading indicators that the industry is getting ready for a much broader multi-gig adoption. During the quarter we closed multi-gig PHY design wins with six customers across access points, gateway, switches and firewalls. We are also getting very strong traction with our refresh switches and PHYs with multiple security hardware customers.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18063,Presentation,"Now let me discuss the outlook for the fourth fiscal quarter for our networking business. We expect growth from 5G to continue with Samsung and the start of a ramp into Nokia, partially offset by a decline in 5G ASICs, as deployments in China take a pause. We project a strong quarter for our automotive business, with quarterly revenue expected to cross in double-digit millions. We expect enterprise switching to continue to improve as we ramp new products. We also expect growth from our liquid security DPU shipping to cloud customers.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18064,Presentation,"Offsetting this growth, we project a sequential decline in revenue from our cloud ASIC. As a result after a very strong third quarter, we expect networking revenue in the fourth quarter to be approximately flat on a sequential basis, and on a year-over-year basis projected to grow approximately 25%, compared to the fourth quarter fiscal 2020 results, adjusted for the divestiture of Wi-Fi. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we are currently supply constrained on some of our networking products.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18065,Presentation,"Now turning to our storage business. Storage revenue for the third quarter was $276 million declining 5% sequentially, lower expectations of being flat. During the quarter demand for Fibre Channel products from our enterprise server and storage customers was impacted more heavily than anticipated, although we expect this level of weakness to be temporary.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18066,Presentation,"On the other hand, the sequential revenue growth we had expected from our storage controller business did materialize, led by a ramp on our custom SSD controllers. Our cloud HDD business also grew sequentially.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18067,Presentation,"At this year's virtual flash memory summit, our storage team had another strong show and alongside HPE, we were named a Best of Show award winner for the Marvell based NVMe RAID boot SSD. HPE is the first of Marvell's partners to support this new accelerator, the product lowers data center total cost of ownership by offloading RAID 1 processing from costly server CPU resources, maximizing application performance.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18068,Presentation,"In addition, we demonstrated our latest data center flash controller for building large capacity ultra-low latency, high performance SSDs and our low power 12-nanometre PCIe Gen4 controller for client SSDs.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18069,Presentation,"Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect our storage business to rebound strongly and project sequential revenue growth in the low teens on a percentage basis. We expect this growth to be driven from multiple products. We project a strong recovery in our Fibre Channel business towards a more normalized run rate. We also expect our cloud storage revenue to continue to grow, which includes more meaningful contribution from our preamplifiers.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18070,Presentation,"In addition, we are projecting the start of a product ramp of a cloud DIY SSD controller design win, I mentioned in my opening remarks.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18071,Presentation,"In closing, our results and guidance continue to progress in the right direction. We are projecting fiscal 2021 fourth quarter revenue at the midpoint of guidance to grow approximately 9% year-over-year and grow 13% year-over-year for the ongoing business as compared to last year's fourth quarter results, adjusted for the divestiture of Wi-Fi. We continue to work closely with our supply chain partners to alleviate constraints and meet the growing demand from our customers.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18072,Presentation,"Through this fiscal year, which has certainly had a share of COVID-19-related challenges, I'm very pleased with the growth we have driven from 5G and cloud, and it is still early days for us in these two critical end markets.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18073,Presentation,,Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18074,Presentation,"In addition, our automotive and preamplifier businesses are now starting to contribute more meaningfully. Our custom SSD controller programs have recently started to ramp and we will benefit from a full year of shipments in fiscal 2022. We also expect that a refreshed Ethernet switch and PHY products will enable us to take share in the enterprise and carrier end markets.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18075,Presentation,"From a broader perspective, there has been encouraging news on the vaccine front, which bodes well for a macro economic recovery next year. Overall, the setup for fiscal year 2022 looks very promising. Equally exciting, we are looking forward to combining with Inphi to accelerate our joint vision to lead the ongoing transformation in the fast growing cloud and 5G markets.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18076,Presentation,"And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jean for more detail on our recent results and outlook.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18077,Presentation,"Thank you, Matt, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results for the third quarter and then provide our current outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Revenue in the third quarter was $750 million. Networking represented 59% of our revenue with the storage contributing 37%, driven by growth in 5G and the cloud and the gravity of revenue contribution from our networking business of nearly 60% reached the new record in the third quarter.",Jean Hu,4392917
,,,,
18078,Presentation,"Revenue from other accounted for 4% of our revenue declining 5% sequentially and 35% year-on-year. As a reminder this business consists of a product we have stopped to investing in. So we expect they will continue to decline over time. Our guidance for the fourth quarter anticipated sequential growth from other, as we expect some customers to complete last time buys on certain components.",Jean Hu,4392917
,,,,
18079,Presentation,"GAAP gross margin was 50.8%, non- GAAP gross margin was 63% of revenue consistent with our guidance. GAAP operating expenses were $390 million, and include the cost for share based compensation expenses, amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition under divestiture related costs. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $280 million. GAAP operating loss was $9 million. Non-GAAP operating profit was $193 million or 25.7% of revenue. For the third quarter GAAP loss per diluted share was $0.03. Non-GAAP income per diluted share was $0.25.",Jean Hu,4392917
,,,,
18080,Presentation,"Now turning to our balance sheet, during the quarter cash flow from operations was $258 million. In fiscal 2021, we have driven strong free cash flow conversion of 114% of non-GAAP net income on a year-to-date basis. We returned $40 million to shareholders through dividend payments. During the quarter, we paid down $100 million of our term loan and exited the quarter with $832 million in cash and short-term investment and the total debt outstanding of $1.35 billion.",Jean Hu,4392917
,,,,
18081,Presentation,We continue to have $500 million of liquidity available from our undrawn revolver. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 0.6 on a trailing 12 month basis. We have temporarily suspended our share repurchase program due to the pending acquisition of Inphi.,Jean Hu,4392917
,,,,
18082,Presentation,"Before I provide our outlook for the fourth quarter, a remainder on our OpEx patterns. Please note that due to the typical seasonality in payroll taxes, our OpEx in the first fiscal quarter tends to increase mid-single digit sequentially on a percentage basis. And this effects then dissipates in the rest of the fiscal year.",Jean Hu,4392917
,,,,
18083,Presentation,"Here's specific guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. We're forecasting revenue to be in the range of $785 million plus or minus 5%. We expect our GAAP gross margin will be approximately 52.8%. We project our non-GAAP gross margin will be approximately 64%, which anticipates a favorable product mix during the fourth quarter. As we discussed during our Investor Day, we expect our non-GAAP gross margin in the near future to be in the range of 63% to 64%, depending upon the relative mix of a certain 5G and the cloud products in any given quarter.",Jean Hu,4392917
,,,,
18084,Presentation,,Jean Hu,4392917
,,,,
18085,Presentation,"We project our GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $379 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $280 million. We expect net interest expense to be approximately $15 million and non-GAAP of tax rate of 5%. We expect our basic weighted average shares outstanding will be $673 million, and our diluted weighted average shares outstanding will be $686 million. As a result, we anticipate GAAP earnings per share in the range of a loss of $0.03 per share on the low end to an income of $0.07 per diluted share on the high end. We expect non-GAAP income per diluted share in the range of $0.25 to $0.33.",Jean Hu,4392917
,,,,
18086,Presentation,"Please note that our GAAP diluted EPS is calculated using basic weighted average shares outstanding, when there's the a GAAP net loss, and calculated using diluted weighted average shares outstanding when there's a GAAP net income.

18087,Presentation,"Operator, please open the lines and announce the Q&A instructions. Thank you.",Jean Hu,4392917
,,,,
18088,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.,Operator,4392917
,,,,
18089,Question-and-Answer,"Hi, thank you very much for taking the question. Matt, you talked about supply constraints having some impact on your business in the quarter. Can you help us quantify how big the impact was in the quarter? And what sort of assumptions are embedded in your guide? Then I've got a quick follow-up. Thank you.",Toshiya Hari,4392917
,,,,
18090,Question-and-Answer,"Sure. Yes, as we noted, we have seen a number of constraints, I would say over the last few quarters, by the way in certain process node bottlenecks as well as I think it's fairly widely known there's significant increase in demand this year for complex substrates as well.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18091,Question-and-Answer,"And so, we've seen this tightness, we're managing through it. The way I would think about it is, we've had a historically a fairly steady level of delinquency that we enter every quarter with delinquency being defined as the amount of product that we had got request dates for in the current quarter in, that we can't supply within the quarter, and that's something that we track on a regular basis.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18092,Question-and-Answer,"Heading into Q4, that number is significantly larger than we've had. And part of that is customers, due to the constraints out there have also placed longer lead times on us. So, I think we're pleased to be able to guide up sequentially. And certainly, if you look year-over-year, the business is up quite strongly overall especially in our networking business. So, we're happy about that. But I guess what I would say is, you should think about it as we're like many other companies, I think carrying a significantly higher level of delinquency than we have historically.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18093,Question-and-Answer,"Got it. Thank you for that. And then as my follow-up on the storage side of the business, the quarter came in a little bit below expectations and you spoke to the decline in the fiber channel business. Going forward, it's good to see that you're guiding the business up low teens in the current quarter. But beyond that, should we assume kind of growth to be in the low-single digit range consistent with what you talked about at your Analyst Day with some of the drivers like, the DIY SSD controller and the preamps or should we expect it to remain pretty lumpy as it relates to storage? Thank you.",Toshiya Hari,4392917
,,,,
18094,Question-and-Answer,"Sure. No, I think the thesis from Investor Day is certainly still intact, and we are pleased to see a nice upswing in the fourth quarter, understanding that Q3 was a little bit weaker, and we did have this somewhat unusual lumpiness in Fibre Channel, which I think as you know, historically has been a relatively stable business. But given some of the impacts earlier this year with supply chain on boards, and some of the COVID-19-related impacts on enterprise, that business did have a lot more volatility to it than we've normally experienced.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18095,Question-and-Answer,,Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18096,Question-and-Answer,"Offsetting that, obviously, has been very, very strong growth in our traditional Marvell storage controller business, which is by the way the business that normally has been historically a little bit more lumpy, that one's performing extremely well due to this DIY flash controller you mentioned, and also our shipments of controllers that end up in cloud applications. And so, I think the fourth quarter is a strong increase, and we certainly see all those growth drivers intact, next year, we get the full benefit of that full year of the DIY shipments to our lead customer there.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18097,Question-and-Answer,"We certainly see cloud computing growing. And then we've also got share gains and preamplifiers. And by the way, I think from a Fiber Channel standpoint, we do expect that in Q4 and beyond that that business trends to a more normal run rate, and I would expect it would not have the same level of volatility we saw earlier this year just given that that was primarily caused by some external shocks relative to COVID-19.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18098,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.,Operator,4392917
,,,,
18099,Question-and-Answer,"Thanks for taking my question. Matt, let me press you a little more on the supply constraint issue just to get a sense of whether it's like $5 million, $10 million, $15 million just some ballpark would help. And then importantly, what does that say about your visibility heading into April? When I look at the current kind of expectations around April, they are for sort of flattish trends versus January, but given this visibility, how should we and these unsolicited orders, what you're referring to as delinquency, how should we think about seasonality heading into April? So just some quantification, and just some color around trends heading into April would be really helpful? Thank you.",Vivek Arya,4392917
,,,,
18100,Question-and-Answer,"Sure. Well, the very first comment, I think, we're certainly pleased that Q4 is up and that's a positive. I think if I just go back up more to 30,000 feet, we're very encouraged about our fiscal '22. As I mentioned earlier, we've got the full year of DIY storage controller. We've got 5G kicking in. There's obviously more growth in cloud and a number of growth drivers. So, I think that we feel very good about for next year. And then I think the slope of that and how that all rolls in, some of that is going to be related to demand, and some of that is also going to also be related to supply and how much progress we can make.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18101,Question-and-Answer,"At this point, it's a little bit difficult to quantify exactly the amount, but what I would say is that directionally the way the business is heading and the growth drivers we outlined at our Investor Day would certainly support the type of growth that we're anticipating next year. So, I think all that's positive in terms of heading into the fourth quarter and beyond. But where Q1 lands, we'll have to get to that when we go ahead and guide that quarter, I think we'll have much better visibility on the supply dynamics.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18102,Question-and-Answer,"But certainly in the short-term, you can see from our Q4 guide, demand has been strong. That's also backed up by strong bookings that we've seen, as well as, as I mentioned, we've got a lot of orders sitting out there that we're working very hard to go fulfill.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18103,Question-and-Answer,Thank you.,Vivek Arya,4392917
,,,,
18104,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. Our next question will come from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead.,Operator,4392917
,,,,
18105,Question-and-Answer,"Hi, Matt. I guess I also wanted to ask about the same topic. And I guess my question is more on timing, and really when you think you'll be able to ship to demand? It sounds like maybe you're getting a little bit of a trade-off here that you're getting a little more longer-term visibility. But I guess my question is really, when do you think you'll be able to ship to demand? And in the fiscal Q4 guidance, does that assume that delinquencies go up versus fiscal Q3? Or does it assume that they stay about the same? Thanks.",Timothy Arcuri,4392917
,,,,
18106,Question-and-Answer,,Timothy Arcuri,4392917
,,,,
18107,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. Look Tim, trust me, I wish I could be a little bit more precise. But I think the way to think about it is on the supply side, at least when we talk to our supply chain partners, there is an anticipation that certainly within the first quarter or two in calendar ?21, that we will see some improvements there. I think a lot of that though depends on how strong the demand environment is. Certainly it's not just us I think signaling that demand is good, I think other companies as well are indicating that.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18108,Question-and-Answer,"So I'd just say it's a fluid situation. But certainly, we hope within the first quarter or two, in next year that we would be able to get up to that run rate. We take our customer satisfaction very seriously. And we're all hands on deck in terms of how to meet the ramp, and I'm confident we will meet the ramp ultimately. We've just got to -- and I've been through a few of these, since I've been in this industry. And ultimately, these things work themselves out. And we've got a world class operations team, and pretty tight communication with our customers at this point. So it'll get there. And I think we'll start seeing improvements in the first-half.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18109,Question-and-Answer,"Just to be clear, Tim, just to be clear in Q4, I mean, maybe for Vivek as well, I mean, we would have guided higher in Q4, obviously had we had better access to the supply that we needed.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18110,Question-and-Answer,"Clear, yes. Thanks, Matt.",Timothy Arcuri,4392917
,,,,
18111,Question-and-Answer,Yes.,Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18112,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. Our next question will come from C. J. Muse with Evercore. Please go ahead.,Operator,4392917
,,,,
18113,Question-and-Answer,"Hey, thank you for taking the question. Sorry to beat a dead horse, Matt, but just curious on the supply constrain side. Are there any particular products within networking that are tighter than others? And then I guess if we can get off of this subject, perhaps you could speak to now that Inphi is expected to be in the fold at Marvell, what are your conversations trending to now with your lead customers? Thank you.",C. J. Muse,4392917
,,,,
18114,Question-and-Answer,"Sure, yes, happy to finish the beating, C. J. But really, if you think about it in our networking business, and whether that's in ASIC, or in some of our switches or even some of our PHYs, some of these products are extremely high pin count devices in very complex packages. And as you go to more and more complex substrates especially, you could say with 5G products or processor products there's just been a number of constraints as these substrate factories try to ramp up production on boards and PCBs that are multiples more complex in terms of number of layers, and number of pins than in previous generation. So I think that's putting some constraint.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18115,Question-and-Answer,"Additionally, the large fabs, the large foundries out there are full. And in some cases, you have legacy nodes, where there's constraints that are a little bit unique. It might be because of who knows, last time buys, I'm not sure from other vendors, but you also have some legacy nodes that actually have some impact, which are a little bit of queue right now.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18116,Question-and-Answer,"So it's across the board, but again the trend is more on the complex products and more around substrates.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18117,Question-and-Answer,"And then your second question, C.J., was on Inphi?",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18118,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, that's right. In terms of your conversations with your leading customers, post the deal announcement, similar to what you discussed, I guess, two years back with Cavium would love to hear, how the reception and whether engagements are accelerating because of bringing this asset into the fold?",C. J. Muse,4392917
,,,,
18119,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. Thanks. We've had, I think, a very strong joint engagements, since we announced the combination. And what I would say is pretty much across the board, there's very strong support from the customer base for this combination. I think, one is certainly in the 5G area, they're very happy to have another strong product line to consider. And we've already got some introductions made there. And then on the cloud side, which is really where Inphi is very deep with a number of the large OEMs. I think there's very constructive discussions right now about a number of opportunities.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18120,Question-and-Answer,,Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18121,Question-and-Answer,"Number of those around ASIC and I think the timing of our 5-nanometer platform, and the traction we're seeing there, actually, that resonates really well. And in many cases, some of these high performance custom ASIC for the cloud, they have direct interfaces to invite optical modules. And so there's actually a fairly tight synergy there between the dense digital logic type of solutions we can provide, connecting to these high performance optical modules that implies enabling.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18122,Question-and-Answer,"So it's going very well and I think certainly, as we clear the various regulatory approvals, we can engage even more deeply. But that's all going extremely well and it does remind me a lot of the synergy that we saw or very early on when we did Cavium, in terms of the customer reception and the ability to go sell a very joint solution. So I'm pretty excited about it. And I think it's meeting all expectations or better than what I anticipated that reaction would be like.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18123,Question-and-Answer,Thank you.,C. J. Muse,4392917
,,,,
18124,Question-and-Answer,Sure.,Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18125,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. Our next question will come from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Please go ahead.,Operator,4392917
,,,,
18126,Question-and-Answer,"Hi, good afternoon. Matt, thanks for taking my question. Just kind of curious, Matt, on the outlook on the enterprise side, it was up. I'm kind of just curious in your conversations you're looking at next year, whether we could see a bit better cycle on the enterprise side.",Blayne Curtis,4392917
,,,,
18127,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, sure. Blayne, I think a couple things. I mean, certainly, there has been a lot of concern about the enterprise market in general. I think we have started to see some positive -- more positive commentary out of some of the large OEMs. So I think that's good. But really, for us, it's sort of a continued story of our own new product introductions and share gain. And so we recently announced in addition to our borderless enterprise portfolio with our auto multi-gig PHYs.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18128,Question-and-Answer,"We had strong design wins on PHYs in the most recent quarter. Our new switches have got great traction as well. And even in our traditional enterprise NIC and Fibre Channel business, we're also seeing strong design activity. So I think all of that bodes well for us, and it certainly even the short-term helping offset what many might consider to be a more challenging overall enterprise environment. We actually see positive trends into Q4 and we anticipate that's going to continue next year. And then as we even highlighted at the Analyst Day with some new more strategic wins.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18129,Question-and-Answer,"One example would be in our OCTEON processor area, there's even growth beyond that. So I think we're very excited about the enterprise business as a key part of our portfolio to drive growth, and also be overall accretive to the gross margins of the company. So it's a good business for us. We're investing there, and we're very focused on product leadership in that area.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18130,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. Our next question will come from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.,Operator,4392917
,,,,
18131,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for the question. Matt, clearly the strength of the story here are all the bottoms up product cycles, and you mentioned a new win in your preamp, I'd love to get a little bit more color, the 5-nanometre OCTEON win against x86. To help us understand, why you think you want that socket? When it starts to ramp? And kind of what the revenue potential there is?",John Pitzer,4392917
,,,,
18132,Question-and-Answer,"And given all the product ramps you have those ramps still live in the real world, and we're still kind of in a macro environment, that's kind of just crawling along. I'm kind of curious, as we get into calendar year '21, if we do see that sort of cyclical recovery in the macro, how much of an accelerant to growth to some of these products cycle, do you think that can be?",John Pitzer,4392917
,,,,
18133,Question-and-Answer,"Sure. Yes, so look, I think, if you go back and you look at, and let's even go back all the way to Cavium days, there's been this ongoing, first it was MEPS [ph] and then transitioned to ARM battle in the networking processor area. And Cavium and now Marvell has had a strong position there, great products, but not the share leader. And even in the sort of embedded world x86 has always been very strong. We're very encouraged by where we sit from a product positioning, as we look at our next generation, or 10th generation OCTEON platform, that's going to be coming out in 5-nanometer. And I think it's well understood, beyond well understood some of the challenges the largest player in that market has in terms of their process roadmap.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18134,Question-and-Answer,,Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18135,Question-and-Answer,"So I think we line up very well from that point-of-view, certainly. But on top of that, we have leadership in architecture, for these types of applications for data plan processing, and very deep relationships with our customers. And so, the win that we highlighted I talked about today, but we have actually talked about at an Investor Day as well was for one of the leading OEMs, not only the United States, but the world who typically makes these types of platform decisions much earlier than others in terms of how they plan.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18136,Question-and-Answer,"So I would say this is sort of a very positive leading indicator that we got selected after very extensive benchmarking, by the way. And we said at the Investor Day, I think it was in Raghib's presentation that this piece of business alone would be an incremental $100 million a year type of annual socket for us, which is huge for a company like ours. We don't have that many sockets of that nature. But I think that that's a very strong leading indicator, John, that in this next cycle with 5-nanometer ramping. And again, this is going to take -- this is going to manifest itself over the next several years. We think we're in a very strong position there.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18137,Question-and-Answer,"So I think there's a chance OCTEON could have a much stronger place in the market than it has historically. And then you're right, even in this environment, at least many of the chip companies are performing well, we think we are, and certainly if we get the economy on a macro level moving in the right direction next year that's really not in our assumptions today, I mean we sort of assume that, at least as we plan -- we're planning that, there's still going to be some turbulence.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18138,Question-and-Answer,"But certainly if the macro improves and there's strength in enterprise spending as an example or businesses are spending again, people are going back to work, et cetera, then I do think it's going to be a left for companies like us. But I think it's a little bit early to tell given all the transitions happening in the world today.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18139,Question-and-Answer,"Thanks, and congratulations.",John Pitzer,4392917
,,,,
18140,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. Thanks, John.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18141,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. Our next question will come from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.,Operator,4392917
,,,,
18142,Question-and-Answer,"Matt, I wanted to dive a little bit into the networking guidance for the quarter and then some longer-term implications. It sounds like pretty much everything is going to be up sequentially, except for two ASIC sides, ASIC on the wireless infrastructure as well as the cloud ASIC side. So are those ASIC pauses -- are those things that are due to the end market weakening, just taking a pause, that be -- I know it's not end of life, but if we already hit kind of a plateau in those businesses?",Ross Seymore,4392917
,,,,
18143,Question-and-Answer,"And then the other side, where everything else is up, how much of that do you think is macro getting better sort of a systematic increase versus Marvell specific product cycles driving that sequential growth?",Ross Seymore,4392917
,,,,
18144,Question-and-Answer,"Sure, yes. Thanks, Ross. So on the first part of it, I actually think it's very consistent with a question you've asked me in the past. I think you during one of the investor road shows you hosted where I did a call with a broad set of investors. You said, hey, with some of these markets you're getting into like carrier or like cloud, how do you expect the volatility of those markets to be and those lend themselves to be somewhat lumpier. ",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18145,Question-and-Answer,"And so that is the case, I mean, you did nail that in that in the case of the cloud side has nothing to do with demand, but the pattern in which new products ramp, and you've probably seen this with other semiconductor vendors, it isn't exactly a linear process, they tend to buy a larger quantity early than there might be a quarter of sort of digestion, and then they come back again.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18146,Question-and-Answer,"So this is actually the strength we saw in Q3 was the beginning of a ramp on this program. And it just they took a large quantity in Q3. Some deployments, they're going to do it in their own data centers through Q4, but certainly we expect that overall program to be up quite a bit in next year, because that's a brand new program and that's just ramping.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18147,Question-and-Answer,,Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18148,Question-and-Answer,"And then on the 5G side, China has been the most aggressive in terms of 5G rollouts globally. And we've seen that strength actually in China for the last two or three quarters, including Q3 being a strong quarter. And I think it's pretty natural for them to do some absorption as well. And that commentaries, I think, been out there somewhat broadly. We certainly think again, overall next year, that China's 5G deployments should continue. There's still a whole bunch to go and will benefit when that happens.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18149,Question-and-Answer,"So yes, I think in those cases, Ross, it's really more of just new products ramping, in the case of cloud, and in the case of 5G, it's just a big a normal fluctuation and how the carrier demand lines in. And then I'd say, for our Q4, you're right pretty much across the board, all of our product lines are up. And I would say it's mostly products driven for us. I mean, let's take automotive as an example, we indicated it was crossing over into double-digit millions. ",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18150,Question-and-Answer,"We've seen car production pickup. We had noted we were in a whole bunch of model year '21 vehicles, that's all now booking. And that's, again, a very unique Marvell product cycle in terms of automotive Ethernet that continues, not only through our fiscal '22, but certainly beyond that, as these programs go into high volume.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18151,Question-and-Answer,"So I would attribute this to be more our own product cycles. But certainly I think if you just talk to other people in the chip industry right now the sentiment is quite bullish in terms of other CEOs and other companies feeling like, it is an overall stronger demand environment out there. But I think we're guiding up, maybe a little bit more than others, just because we do have some unique product cycles that we're a part of.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18152,Question-and-Answer,"Thanks, Matt.",Ross Seymore,4392917
,,,,
18153,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. Our next question will come from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Please go ahead.,Operator,4392917
,,,,
18154,Question-and-Answer,"Yes. Thank you, and congratulations on the results. And Matt, thank you for the sort of preview on ORAN, VRAN. I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit more of the company's positioning there. Maybe not as much of the technology side, but kind of more on the business model and how that supply chain works. My understanding, it's going to be more of a white box market. So any color you could share with us there on the positioning would be great.",Tore Svanberg,4392917
,,,,
18155,Question-and-Answer,"Sure. Yes, I'll continue a little bit of my mini preview. But I think Tore you should expect relatively soon we'll be doing a pretty comprehensive release on ORAN and VRAN by the way in terms of how we're going to play, how we fit in the market. And it'll be a combination of technology and also segmentation.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18156,Question-and-Answer,"But, I think to keep it at a higher level, it is an interesting potential disruption that's out there, and it certainly gained momentum in terms of the conversations we're having over the last six to nine months. I do think there will be -- I think it will get deployed in some areas.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18157,Question-and-Answer,"And I view it in a couple ways. One, I think there are smaller emerging players who would be more in the white box model. And you should assume, we're going to have more of a standard offering that leverages all of the IP that we've already developed, and is a fairly efficient way to get merchant products out into the market.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18158,Question-and-Answer,"And that's available today. As you know, we're shipping macro class, 5G baseband processors today. So I think we're in the best position of any company quickly to go do that. At the same time, the large incumbent players in RAN are not asleep at the wheel. And I think each of them will have their own go-to-market around ORAN and VRAN. And the [indiscernible] customers were also a key provider to them already for the macro.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18159,Question-and-Answer,"And so I think we have an ability to support the traditional players who probably have to grapple with some level of innovators dilemma on this market, in terms of how they go about it, and how they play and how they manage it. And then there's a set of upstarts that we can also address.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18160,Question-and-Answer,,Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18161,Question-and-Answer,"So more on that later, but I think it won't be just white box and sort of startup companies. I think it'll be a combination of the two. And I think it'll take some time to play out Tore, I don't think this is an overnight sensation, and probably will go because sort of map the hype cycle curve on it, like we've seen with a lot of other emerging technologies. ORAN probably looks a lot like that. And so you can pick your place on the hype cycle, it's probably on the way up, and there'll be a point where it's probably got a pause, and then at some point, it'll make an impact.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18162,Question-and-Answer,"But we certainly plan to be there, but in a way that enables the broader market, and leverages all the development we've already done. I think that's the key part is doing this in an R&D efficient way, which enables us to participate in it.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18163,Question-and-Answer,Very helpful. Thank you.,Tore Svanberg,4392917
,,,,
18164,Question-and-Answer,Yes.,Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18165,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. And our next question will come from Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.,Operator,4392917
,,,,
18166,Question-and-Answer,"Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. It looks like capacity optimized or near line HDD shipments are looking or starting to pick up this quarter ahead of what looks to be a reacceleration in cloud spending, starting kind of first-half of next year. I think your two lead HDD customers are well into the ramp of 16 terabytes, but they're also starting to qualify 18 as well. And as we progress through next year, it sort of looks like 18 is going to be the sweet spot for volume. So what's my last dollar content opportunity on 18 versus 16 with your two lead customers? And is the team starting to get visibility on continued strength in your near line business over the next several quarters?",Harlan Sur,4392917
,,,,
18167,Question-and-Answer,"Sure. Harlan, I think the corollary around cloud demand and cloud strength certainly ripples back in the near line. So, we do see that in the short-term. As you probably know that the big move for us is really the ability to get preamplifiers in terms of the content. And so we have certainly one account that we're shipping with today along with controllers. So beyond that the content from a controller and even plus preamplifier standpoint, doesn't change all that much from these generations.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18168,Question-and-Answer,"I think the big mover for us is if we can get more preamp engagements in the near line side. We certainly have one that's already publicly announced and we're working on more. But I think ASPs content, as you get to these high capacity drives is going to be fairly similar from generation-to-generation and that goes for 18, it goes for 20, it goes for beyond. Unfortunately, that's always the challenge is there's just tremendous Exabyte growth and tremendous data storage growth happening, the controllers unfortunately don't get the same type of ASP uplift to them.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18169,Question-and-Answer,"Although, we've managed to get a little bit more value, generation-to-generation, but it's very incremental relative to the bank for the buck the cloud customers get by going from a 16 to an 18, or an 18 to a 20. We don't see that in our ASPs. But it's good business and we certainly had a lot of value there.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18170,Question-and-Answer,"Thanks, Matt.",Harlan Sur,4392917
,,,,
18171,Question-and-Answer,Thank you. Our next question will come from Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.,Operator,4392917
,,,,
18172,Question-and-Answer,"Thanks for the question, guys. I also thought the top of rack switch announcement at a hyper scalar was interesting as well. You've previously focused on the enterprise market, rather than the market where we're really talking about speeds and feeds, but it looks like there could be a more of a shift there. And I was wondering if that is the case and perhaps you can describe your capabilities there. Is this all coming out of Israel right now? And what else would you have to do to try to catch up with the incumbent here?",Christopher Rolland,4392917
,,,,
18173,Question-and-Answer,,Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18174,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, so let me be really clear, Chris. For the Marvell designed business that has been classically focused on enterprise switching, campus switching, soho, core and aggregation switching and that's been our sweet spot, that's where we've been growing. When you go to the speeds and feeds and cloud side, we don't have a development internally on that. So the reference, I think, that you're pointing to, is an ASIC win that we have. And we actually have a number of these that we're working on from the Avera business. And now, it's Marvell business because, in some cases, we won these since we joined forces.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18175,Question-and-Answer,"So the way that we think about accessing that kind of high end top of racks switch market, actually, we think we're probably better served at this point, supplying custom ASIC to people who want to compete in that market. And I would say that for global usage, whether it's across the super seven.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18176,Question-and-Answer,"And that also gives us a nice strategic entree as well as we think about when we could join forces with Inphi and the roadmap really looking more and more to go to co-package optics. Our ability to be I would call more open source there and really support the ecosystem and support the broader set of companies that are doing these that aren't the market leader. I think it's good for us. I think we sort of think the returns to do that or probably better than if we just tried to go head-to-head, which we've said for many years is just not our strategy.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18177,Question-and-Answer,"I do think the large competitor there who is the market leader, they just announced a new product. I think that's actually good, because it's showing from an optic standpoint, that it's going to continue to drive the need for optics. And that's going to be a tailwind, ultimately, for people like Inphi. So we have to think it through, Chris, in terms of how we go in there. But today, just to be very clear, the win that we announced was custom ASIC with another company who were doing a high end switch for.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18178,Question-and-Answer,And today's final question will come from Srini Pajjuri with SMBC Nikko Securities. Please go ahead.,Operator,4392917
,,,,
18179,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you. Hi, Matt. I have a follow-up to one of the previous questions. Matt, if I look at your networking guidance, you said Samsung will be up, Nokia will be up in 5G, but the ASIC business is down. So if you could please clarify if 5G in total is growing or declining or flattish.",Srini Pajjuri,4392917
,,,,
18180,Question-and-Answer,"And then, as we head into the next year, first-half of next year, if you could qualitatively talk about what you're thinking or how have you looking at Samsung and Nokia, continuing ramps in the first-half? And also as far as ASIC is concerned is the rebound or recovery in ASIC is a pretty much a function of China coming back? Or do you see any other regions helping that market to recover? Thank you.",Srini Pajjuri,4392917
,,,,
18181,Question-and-Answer,"Sure, yes. So I think it -- and I kind of starting at the high level first. The nice thing about our portfolio Srini is we have both these ASIC opportunities that are now materialized mostly driving China and then we have our other two lead customers for the Marvell stuff. And there's a great example of where we had a lot of strength early on through the China ramp on our ASIC business, that's somewhat moderated. ",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18182,Question-and-Answer,"And now the good news is, we see Samsung showing a lot of strength, which is great, we invested a lot there. And I think, it's very encouraging to see that, that really start to go. And then we've got the new wins that Nokia that are, I think well understood. And so that's just starting.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18183,Question-and-Answer,"If you look at Q4, it'll be our, we're guiding it to be our sixth straight sequential quarter-over-quarter growth quarter for 5G. So in aggregate, it's going to continue to grow. And it has been growing and I think others in this communications market have seen a little bit more volatility during different parts of the last call it four to six quarters, because, in general, the other players are more established, they were bigger in 4G. And so our play is really we're emerging, we're gaining share in 5G, we have new programs ramping, we have new customers ramping, and we've got this nice mix now and diversity such that even if one region or geography has a digestion quarter, we've got the others kicking in.",Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18184,Question-and-Answer,,Matt Murphy,4392917
,,,,
18185,Question-and-Answer,"And certainly, we anticipate that next year we'll see growth across the board. We think China should resume and we see our lead customer continuing to ramp, especially as the U.S. starts to deploy. I think there's going to be a lot of need to go do that, especially with the 5G iPhone selling as well as they appear to be. And also if you look at Qualcomm's forecast next year of 500 million 5G enabled phones, I think that's going to drive a lot of demand for networks. And between the design win positions we have with the leading players who will supply the leading early geographies, we think we're in very good shape for our fiscal '22 next year.",Matt Murphy,4392917

,,,,
18198,Presentation,"Okay. Sorry everybody let me learn how to use Teams on my conference call. I guess I was on mute talking away. We've really put in some great results. Let me start over. So thank everyone for joining our call. I need some training. So earlier this afternoon, we reported our fourth quarter and full year results for fiscal 2020. Revenue for the fiscal 2020 fourth quarter was $2.98 million, an increase of 12% compared to the same period a year ago. Revenue for the fiscal 2020 full year was $11.8 million, an increase of 11% over fiscal 2019.",Jerry Fleming,4392915
,,,,
18199,Presentation,"So I'll first discuss fiscal 2020 revenue by category and then I'll follow that with an update of our cloud business strategy. So beginning with our one-time product revenue, which represents software license revenue we just purchased by customers for their legacy on premises Altigen systems, in fiscal 2020 our one-time product revenue was $870,000, which was a decrease of 23% compared to fiscal 2019.",Jerry Fleming,4392915
,,,,
18200,Presentation,,Jerry Fleming,4392915
,,,,
18201,Presentation,"As we discussed previously, one-time product revenue will continue to experience a downward trend as a direct consequence of our cloud-first business strategy, but along those lines, our objective does remain to convert the remaining on premises customers to the cloud as quickly as we can.",Jerry Fleming,4392915
,,,,
18202,Presentation,"Moving to our annual recurring revenue this represents revenue from our annual software maintenance agreements, which were also purchased by Customers, which have an on-premise or in house MaxCS phone system and this includes product support of fixes and product upgrades, because annual recurring revenue is tied to onetime product revenue, this revenue will also saw a decrease over time as our on-premise customers migrate to the Altigen cloud. In fiscal 2020, annual recurring revenue was $2.7 million compared to $2.9 million in the previous fiscal year representing a 7% decline.",Jerry Fleming,4392915
,,,,
18203,Presentation,"The third category we track is services revenue, which includes revenue received for cloud deployments, technical support and custom product development. We expect services revenue to trend upward over time, as we continue to grow our number of cloud customers, particularly as everybody start Microsoft Team Solutions.",Jerry Fleming,4392915
,,,,
18204,Presentation,"However for any given quarter, service revenue may be up or down based on the timing of the completion of customer deployments. Sorry, Carolyn can you confirm if there's a problem on the line here? I don't hear edges. I am just a lot of background noise. So I apologize. That's the -- are you hearing me okay Carolyn? So I will go ahead and continue.",Jerry Fleming,4392915
,,,,
18205,Presentation,I can hear you. Let's just confirm with the operator that the investors can hear us? Operator can you?,Carolyn David,4392915
,,,,
18206,Presentation,Yeah the background noise is from Mr. Allen's line.,Operator,4392915
,,,,
18207,Presentation,"All right. Sorry about that everybody. Apparently, we have some more internal training to do. It's not just me. So let me pick up where I left off. However, for any given quarter, our services revenues may be up or down based on the timing of the completion of customer deployments and our customization projects. That being said, fiscal 2020 services revenue was $610,000, an increase of 42% compared to fiscal 2019.",Jerry Fleming,4392915
,,,,
18208,Presentation,"Now the final category and I think the one folks are most interested in is monthly recurring revenue, which consists of Altigen's various cloud-based software as a service offerings as well as our SIP Trunk communication service. Our monthly recurring revenue for fiscal 2020 was $7.6 million compared to $6.2 million in fiscal 2019, which represents a 23% increase year-over-year.",Jerry Fleming,4392915
,,,,
18209,Presentation,"Now regarding our cloud business strategy, we have three distinct go-to-market models. First is our MaxCS cloud PBX, which is targeted at small to midsize business customers and for this product COVID-19 has had a significant impact on the MacCS small business customers. As everyone is aware, the onset of COVID-19 forced companies to support largely work at home workforce. This situation initially resulted in increased MacCS-related revenues, mostly due to the fact that customers need to add additional licenses to support their employees in a new work at home environment.",Jerry Fleming,4392915
,,,,
18210,Presentation,"On the other hand over the past six months, COVID-19 has also caused a significant negative impact on the smaller end of those -- smaller range of that customer base. Many of those customers downsized or in some cases, went out of business. So that being said for fiscal 2020 our MacCS-only cloud revenue, just the MacCS PBX portion of our revenues excluding Fiserv and our Team Solutions grew by 3% compared to fiscal 2019.",Jerry Fleming,4392915
,,,,
18211,Presentation,"Now while we have seen some slowing growth of our MacCS cloud platform as we continue to migrate our customers from on-premise to the cloud, we're also working on the rollout of a next-generation cloud unified communications platform that will significantly enhance the current MacCS functionality. Our new UC features will include unified presence, instant messaging, web conferencing and a mobile UC app. Now the reason we're doing this is for those small business customers that are too small to leverage Teams, we're going to introduce this product to make sure that we keep those customers and keep generating revenue for that core MacCS business. For this product, we expect to launch -- we expect to launch this product in our upcoming fiscal third quarter.",Jerry Fleming,4392915
,,,,
18212,Presentation,,Jerry Fleming,4392915
,,,,
18213,Presentation,"So now we've to provide you guys with an update on our Fiserv business. Historically, Fiserv has sold Altigen's MacCS PBX and our Interactive Voice Response or IVR solutions to their on-premise customers. Over the past few years, Fiserv has also migrated these solutions to the cloud and may now offer Altigen's PBX and IVR solutions as a hosted managed service.",Jerry Fleming,4392915
,,,,
18214,Presentation,"Our fiscal 2020 cloud revenues from Fiserv grew by just over 40% in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 cloud revenues. In addition, now that we've completed the integration of our MacCS PBX with the FrontStage Omni-Channel Contact Center solution, we're actively engaged in customer pilots with Fiserv. In fact, we're now in the final phases of our first MacCS front stage deployment at a fairly large Fiserv banking customer and expect to go live next month.",Jerry Fleming,4392915
,,,,
18215,Presentation,"Because this is a completely new solution for us, I am referring to FrontStage, there has been a learning curve on both sides, Fiserv and Altigen, but we're getting closer to the end of that curve and we're looking forward to a full launch of the FrontStage Solution to the Fiserv customer base in calendar Q1.",Jerry Fleming,4392915
,,,,
18216,Presentation,"Turning to Microsoft Teams, I'll first review our Teams' solution portfolio, which for the past 18 months has included only our direct routing strip [ph] transfer teams and our hosted Skype for business, which is Microsoft's predecessor to Teams. In fiscal 2020, we recorded $793,000 in revenue for our Team Solutions, which is 150% increase over fiscal 2019.",Jerry Fleming,4392915
,,,,
18217,Presentation,"This fiscal year, we've also added our new Teams service delivery management portal and a cloud-based Teams reporting solution to that Team solution portfolio yet so far. Next quarter, we plan to launch FrontStage for Microsoft Teams, which will enable us to address the growing market for integrated teams contact center solutions. In addition, in September, we acquired the CoreInteract platform from Blue Panda Communications. Now as part of that transaction, we also brought over the entire Blue Panda CoreInteract development team as well as Blue Panda CEO, Mark Allen whom I'll introduced shortly.",Jerry Fleming,4392915
,,,,
18218,Presentation,"Just to provide a brief overview, CoreInteract is a digital customer engagement platform, which targets Teams? enterprise users and is built as a native Azure, Microsoft Azure application, which seamlessly integrates the Teams. So the timing of the release of our multiple new Teams applications and services really couldn't be better given that Teams is continuing its rapid growth in the corporate enterprise. In fact, Microsoft recently reported that they are now more than 115 million Teams corporate subscribers up from approximately 20 million subscribers just a year ago.",Jerry Fleming,4392915
,,,,
18219,Presentation,"In addition to the work we've been doing to introduce our new solutions and services for Teams, we've also been bolstering our technical operations capabilities to prepare Altigen for the demands of enterprise customers. Key to that strategy was the hiring of Joe Hamlin, Altigen's new Chief Operations Officer. Joe was most recently Vice President of Enterprise IT Services at Sprint and brings to Altigen the operational expertise and discipline required for us to be successfully penetrating the enterprise market and I'll introduce Joe shortly as well.",Jerry Fleming,4392915
,,,,
18220,Presentation,"So as I mentioned previously, Mark Allen has joined us from Blue Panda. Mark is now our new Chief Technology Officer responsible for driving our product strategy and I am going to turn the call over to Mark briefly to provide you guys with an update. Mark?",Jerry Fleming,4392915
,,,,
18221,Presentation,"Thank you, Jerry and I apologize for the disruption to my office earlier so I?m [indiscernible] caught me off guard. But hello, everyone for those of you I have not met, I've been a long time UC industry influencer [and innovators] [ph] starting with the creation of the Microsoft voice offering groundwork in 2006 and signing that over to Microsoft in 2007. After that I formed Blue Panda Communications and created CoreInteract and as Jerry nicely described. CoreInteract is a first of its kind digital customer engagement platform specifically designed to extend the capabilities of Microsoft Teams.",Mark Allen,4392915

18223,Presentation,CoreInteract platform is native serverless Azure application globally scaled to provide advanced communication [revenue] [ph] queuing for Microsoft Teams which improves the company's ability to communicate with their customers while increasing employee productivity. CoreInteract further includes advanced analytics and management reporting to provide organizations with a complete 360 degree view of their customer interactions.,Mark Allen,4392915
,,,,
18224,Presentation,"CoreInteract adds critical communication features, not natively available on Teams and as such truly enables the company to replace their existing PBX systems with Microsoft Teams sound system. CoreInteract's extensive roadmap includes leveraging AI and cognitive services and advanced machine learning capability to our suite of solutions including customer facing tools for building automated customer engagement [box] [ph] and industry benchmarking reports. I'm very excited to be here with Altigen and many great things to come and I'll go ahead turn the call back to Jerry.",Mark Allen,4392915
,,,,
18225,Presentation,"Thank you, Mark. My line was muted so I will say that, Mark, we're excited to have you here as well and for the folks on the line obviously you can tell Mark is our CTO with the number of acronyms and Mark?s responsibility here is not only with CoreInteract, but to identify and leverage new technologies for us to drive our company forward.",Jerry Fleming,4392915
,,,,
18226,Presentation,"So with that being said, I'd now like to introduce Mr. Joe Hamblin",Jerry Fleming,4392915
,,,,
18227,Presentation,"Thanks Jerry. Good afternoon, everyone. Absolutely my first three months here with Altigen have really been exciting and I am thrilled to be a part of the Altigen leadership team. The organization's energy and enthusiasm has really been refreshing to me especially coming from a long time of some of the challenges I faced at Sprint over the years and some of our financial challenges there, this is really just been a refreshing environment.",Joe Hamblin,4392915
,,,,
18228,Presentation,"Since this is my first time joining the earnings call, I thought I would be appropriate for me to give you a brief summary of my background. I?ve spent over 30 years with Sprint in a variety leadership roles most notably as Vice President of Enterprise Services where I was responsible for Sprint entire IT infrastructure and operations ecosystem. Prior to that role I spent nearly 10 years as Director of Sprint's Unified Communications and collaboration organization. In this role, we were able to demonstrate how UC could transform the entire way an enterprise the size of Sprint worked, while at the same time, dramatically reducing our operational expenses.",Joe Hamblin,4392915
,,,,
18229,Presentation,"My passion for Unified Commutations, my understanding of the challenges my former IT peers faced on a day-to-day basis including dealing with such businesses challenging as the Coronavirus, gives me unique insight that I can use to help drive enterprise sales. In addition I am able to leverage my years of operational expertise and organizational-readiness strategies to make sure Altigen is well prepared to play in the enterprise space.",Joe Hamblin,4392915
,,,,
18230,Presentation,"You couple these things, couple my experience along with Altigen's years of communications experience and our focus on Teams and the emerging powerful suite of UC solutions positions us well for the long-term growth in this market. Again I am excited to be here, excited to be partnering with folks like Mark and bringing in these new solutions, but at this time, Jerry I am going to turn it back over to you.",Joe Hamblin,4392915
,,,,
18231,Presentation,"All right. Thanks Joe and I do have my mute button off this time. So I appreciate your [indiscernible] and you already have made a great impact here as has Mark and we're certainly looking forward to work with you guys to continue to accelerate the growth of our business. But at this point, I am going to turn the call over to Carolyn David to review the financials in more detail. Carolyn?",Jerry Fleming,4392915
,,,,
18232,Presentation,,Jerry Fleming,4392915
,,,,
18233,Presentation,"Great. Thank you, Jerry. Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $2.98 million down 1% sequentially and up 12% from the prior year quarter. For the full year 2020, total revenue grew 11% to $11.8 million. Our COG revenue was $2.1 million in Q4 up 5% from $1.98 million in the preceding quarter and up 30% from $1.6 million in the same quarter last year.",Carolyn David,4392915
,,,,
18234,Presentation,"Compared to fiscal 2019, fiscal year 2020 cloud revenue increased 23% to $7.6 million. Software license revenue for the quarter was $135,000 down 52% sequentially and down 49% from $265,000 in the comparable period last year. On a 12 month basis, software license revenue decreased 23% to $870,000 in fiscal 2020 compared to $1.1 million over fiscal 2019. Our fourth quarter revenue from software-assurance decreased to $647,000 compared with $655,000 in the previous quarter and compared with $712,000 in the prior year period. Year-over-year software-assurance revenue declined 7% to $2.7 million in comparison to $2.9 million in fiscal 2019.",Carolyn David,4392915
,,,,
18235,Presentation,"Our professional services and other revenues was approximately $115,000 for the current quarter compared with the preceding and prior-year quarters of the $105,000 and $87,000 respectively. For the full year 2020, professional services and other revenue was $610,000 up 42% compared to fiscal 2019.",Carolyn David,4392915
,,,,
18236,Presentation,"Now let's turn to the margins, fourth quarter gross margin was 77.2% versus 80.3% in the comparable period last year. Year-over-year, gross margin decreased 440 basis points to 77% compared to the year ago period at 81.4%. The decrease in gross margin was primarily driven by the impact of higher amortization of capitalized software and acquisition-related cost and to a lesser extent a shift in our product mix.",Carolyn David,4392915
,,,,
18237,Presentation,"GAAP operating expenses for the quarter totaled $1.7 million up 5% from $1.6 million in the prior year quarter. For the full year 2020, GAAP operating expenses increased 8% to $7 million compared to $6.5 million for fiscal year 2019. Both the quarter-over-quarter and the year-over-year increase was primarily related to litigation expenses in connection with the pending CPI claim.",Carolyn David,4392915
,,,,
18238,Presentation,"On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses totaled $1.5 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to the prior year fourth quarter of $1.6 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $6.6 million for fiscal 2020 compared with $6.3 million over fiscal 2019. For the fourth quarter GAAP net income was $20,000 or $0.00 per diluted share compared to $290,000 of $0.01 per diluted share in the comparable period last year. GAAP net income for the 12 months of fiscal 2020 totaled $1.4 million or $0.06 per diluted share compared with fiscal 2019 GAAP net income of $1.9 or $0.07 per diluted share.",Carolyn David,4392915
,,,,
18239,Presentation,"I would like to note that our fourth quarter fiscal 2020 financial results include a non-cash tax expense of approximately $549,000 related to the company's income tax rate, which defers from its statutory rate primarily due to expired NOLs and the disallowance of expenses paid with the PPP loan proceeds.",Carolyn David,4392915
,,,,
18240,Presentation,"Our non-GAAP net income for the current quarter was $873,000 or $0.03 per diluted share compared to $635,000 or $0.02 per diluted share in the same quarter last year. Year-over-year non-GAAP net income was $2.9 million compared with $2.5 million in fiscal 2019 representing an increase of approximately 17%. Now let's turn over to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $6.6 million in cash and cash equivalents compared to $6.1 million at the end of the preceding quarter. Our working capital was $4.2 million compared to $4.1 million at the end of the preceding quarter.",Carolyn David,4392915

,,,,
18244,Presentation,"This is weird because I didn?t put myself on mute, that's so strange, okay. So let me start again guys. Sorry about that. I don?t know how this is happening. So thank you Carolyn. To summarize Altigen has been diligently working for the past five years or so to migrate our customers to the cloud and in fact to date the majority of our cloud revenues have come from our hosted PBX platform. But for the past 18 months, we've also been working toward accelerating our revenue growth with new cloud solutions for Fiserv and Microsoft Teams. That aspect of our business is now starting to take root.",Jerry Fleming,4392915
,,,,
18245,Presentation,"Building upon that, with the pending introduction of our FrontStage contact center and CoreInteract digital customer engagement platforms, we're now in the position to start driving new incremental revenue streams in these new market opportunities.",Jerry Fleming,4392915
,,,,
18246,Presentation,"So at this time, I'll leave my mute button off in order to address any questions and I'll now turn the call back to the operator. Omar?",Jerry Fleming,4392915

18247,Question-and-Answer,[Operator instructions] Our first question is from Ian Castle with MicroCapClub. Ian state your question please.,Operator,4392915
,,,,
18248,Question-and-Answer,"Jerry congratulations on the quarter. You seem to be putting a lot of talent around you in the last call it 90 or 120 days and also some technology as well. I am curious when you see all this coming together, could you provide may be some color on when you see these pieces coming together maybe acceleration revenue?",Ian Castle,4392915
,,,,
18249,Question-and-Answer,"Yes it's a good question, Ian and first of all I do need to point out there are crummy trainers on how to use the mute button on Teams but they're good business guys. So, as it relates to the revenue, since both of these solutions we expect to officially GA and I'd say both these solutions and I am talking now about the FrontStage contact center for Teams as well as the CoreInteract for Teams, to have available to us in calendar Q1.",Jerry Fleming,4392915
,,,,
18250,Question-and-Answer,"So to the extent that we can get through these what to do as obviously as first time products, we'll have to get through the customer pilots, but we do expect to be either billing or very close to billing in calendar Q1, which of course is our fiscal Q2 and then the wrapping from there. So we will see an impact. I can't say what the impact will be, but we will see a revenue impact from both solutions in FY '21.",Jerry Fleming,4392915
,,,,
18251,Question-and-Answer,"All right, Mr. Fleming it appears we have no further questions. Do you have any closing remarks?",Operator,4392915

18256,Presentation,"Thank you, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Yext's fiscal third quarter 2021 conference call. With me today are CEO, Howard Lerman; CFO, Steve Cakebread; and Chief Revenue Officers, David Rudnitsky and Patrick Blair.",Yuka Broderick,4392913
,,,,
18257,Presentation,"Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that this call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements about revenue and non-GAAP net income, customer upsells and retention, sales efficiency, hiring targets, expense margins, market opportunities, business performance, capital expenditures, and other non-historical statements as further described in our press release.

18259,Presentation,"During the call, we will also refer to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations with the most comparable GAAP measures are also available in the press release, which is available at investors.yext.com.

,,,,
18260,Presentation,"With that, I will turn the call over to Howard.",Yuka Broderick,4392913
,,,,
18261,Presentation,"Well, thank you, Yuka. We had a solid third quarter. We closed 86 Answers-led deals in Q3, driving over 30% of our new and upsell ACV in the quarter and that compares to 20% of new and upsell ACV in Q2. It also includes our conversion of the states of New Jersey and Alabama to paid customers that represents our first customers in the government vertical, and we're seeing fast traction in another new vertical, higher education, with Bucknell University, Texas Christian University, and Adelphi University adding Answers to their Web sites. Our Knowledge Graph continues to grow with over 405 million facts now contained in it, growing 58% year-over-year.",Howard Lerman,4392913
,,,,
18262,Presentation,"While we're focused laserly on revenue growth driven by our Land with Answers sales motion, we're also simultaneously focused on greater efficiency, particularly in GAAP sales and marketing as a percentage of sales, and we dramatically improved that metric this quarter, from 81% in the third quarter of fiscal '20 to 64% in the third quarter of fiscal '21. This helped drive our Q3 non-GAAP loss per share to $0.02, well above our guidance of $0.07 to $0.09 loss. We don't believe these are temporary improvements. We are committed to driving sustainable increases in operating margins and will continue to take action on cost efficiencies in the coming quarters. Land with Answers is efficient.",Howard Lerman,4392913
,,,,
18263,Presentation,,Howard Lerman,4392913
,,,,
18264,Presentation,"And while these numbers show that we can effectively manage the business despite the continued challenges of the current global economic environment, our metrics also tell a more exciting story, that the world is hungry for a big breakthrough in search. Search is critical. Every customer experience starts with a question, and when it comes to branded search there's really two places where searches can happen, either on a company's Web site or in Google, but billions of times a day brand Web sites fail to answer the most basic questions, so their customers at that exact moment of intent bounce over to Google to continue their quest for an answer, and when Web sites keep failing you, and failing you, over and over again you learn to just start your customer journey on Google.",Howard Lerman,4392913
,,,,
18265,Presentation,"But the reality is the experience isn't even better for a customer. In fact, you could argue it's even worse because in that context Google isn't really a search engine, it's an ads engine. In other words, it's incentivized to deliver a slew of ads, not a direct answer to the question, and I want to show you what I mean by this. We posted a slide deck to the Investors section of our Web site, and I'm going to refer to that here. If you look at slide three, when I type in a simple branded search query on Google for information about a Sleep Number product, I get the result, shown on slide four.",Howard Lerman,4392913
,,,,
18266,Presentation,"There are literally 14, one-four, 14 ads above the fold before an organic result is an option. Now, please take a look at slide five for another example, and this was highlighted in technology columnist Geoffrey Fowler's Washington Post article last month, where he highlighted how Google's search experience has gotten worse over time. If I ask a question about how to check my Krispy Kreme rewards card balance, that just by the way happens to be the most popular question asked to them, Google delivers what appears to be an answer from the brand, but if you look carefully it's not. You see that on slide six, it's a random third party, and while it's not labeled an ad, the experience is all about selling you something, and if you engage on the site you get hit with popup ads, like in slide seven.",Howard Lerman,4392913
,,,,
18267,Presentation,"So, why would Google reward this strange site and its very annoying sales tactics and ads ahead of an answer, a direct answer from Krispy Kreme itself, as this is ironic because even the cofounders of Google denounced this in one of their early research papers in 1998, and I quote they said, ""We expect that advertising-funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers."" They were right. Brand search queries reward the highest bidding advertiser. So it becomes a numbers game, and how much does a brand have to pay to get in front of a customer asking for them, and then how many ads does a customer have to navigate before getting the answer that they want.",Howard Lerman,4392913
,,,,
18268,Presentation,"And that is what has inspired our Answers, Not Ads campaign that we launched last month. More than just a meme, Answers, Not Ads poses an important question to every company, when your customers have questions about you do you want to give them answers, or do you want to give them ads. To us the answer is obvious, but the reality is that the only way a brand can compete with Google is to offer a Google-like experience. Think of it like their own Google on their own site, and that is not easy. Yes, site search exists, but it's not that modern, it's index based, meaning it functions to deliver links that send you to another page on would Web site, that's search 1.0, and it's how Google used to work.",Howard Lerman,4392913
,,,,
18269,Presentation,"But Google modernized, and they built a knowledge graph that continues all of the facts that they know about the world, their relationships that combines with natural language understanding to present their users with answers, and that's where we come in, where Yext comes in. Our Answers search engine is the breakthrough that gives brands a modern search experience so they can take that customer journey to deliver Answers, Not Ads, to every customer question. Modern search has three layers. The first is a knowledge graph that's a brain-like database, contains all the facts represented as entities and their relationships. This provides the foundation for answers to be derived from an understanding of natural language, and that's the second layer of modern search.",Howard Lerman,4392913
,,,,
18270,Presentation,,Howard Lerman,4392913
,,,,
18271,Presentation,"The third layer is a dynamic interface that allows users to transact with the answer itself. This is essentially how Google has won in consumer search, and we believe there's an opportunity for the millions and businesses and organizations around the world to win in branded search. This is happening in real-time. Every time Yext answers a question we've won back branded search on behalf of the customer. If you look at slide nine, you'll see of Yext Answers addresses the same question about Krispy Kreme gift cards, but instead of receiving a poor customer experience from a third-party Web site, the customer just gets the correct answer, and they can click straight through to the webpage where they can check the gift balance online, which you see on slide 10.",Howard Lerman,4392913
,,,,
18272,Presentation,"And as for the Sleep Number question about hypoallergenic pillows, on slide 11, Yext Answers direct the customer to exactly the products that match their requested attributes, including call to action buttons that's part of that dynamic interface, which leads to a conversion, on slide 12.",Howard Lerman,4392913
,,,,
18273,Presentation,"We know that delivering official answers makes a big difference, not only because more and more brands are adding Answers to their Web site, but also from their own experience. Almost immediately after launching Yext Answers on our own Web site, branded searches for Yext declined, this is astounding, 34% on Google. Now you might think that's a negative, but the beauty is at the same time the number of searches on our own site increased by the same amount as the decline on Google. This shows that branded searches on Google and searches on a brand's own site are intricately linked. It's kind of an obvious point, but when you give people a great site search experience, a great search experience in your site they come back, they get trained; they come back again and again. Transforming the broken world of search is a long game. We are only in the top-half of the first inning, and we're generating tremendous interest closing deals of all sizes across all sectors.",Howard Lerman,4392913
,,,,
18274,Presentation,"Finally, I want to take a minute to highlight and welcome Hillary Smith to our Board of Directors. Hillary is a highly experienced tech executive. She played a key role in the success of several companies, including Square. She is currently an operating partner at Craft Ventures. We are proud Hillary decided to join our Board of Directors and Comp committee, and we really look forward to working with her.",Howard Lerman,4392913
,,,,
18275,Presentation,"And now to tell you more about our progress in the last quarter, I'm going to turn it over to David Rudnitsky, our Co-Chief Revenue Officer, Dave?",Howard Lerman,4392913
,,,,
18276,Presentation,"Thanks, Howard, and I will further review of Q3. The sales org had a solid Q3, new customer activity continues to improve and gross retention was in our historical range. In Q3, overall close 107 new and renewal deals with at least $100,000 of total contract value. This includes 10 deals with more than $1 million of total contract value.",David Rudnitsky,4392913
,,,,
18277,Presentation,"The total number of ex-mid-market and enterprise customers increased 28% year-over-year to nearly 2300. This excludes our SMB and third party reseller customers. Our quota-carrying sales rep count at the end of Q3 was nearly 240. We're on track to reach our target of 255 quota-carrying sales reps by the end of the fiscal year, consistent with our original plan.",David Rudnitsky,4392913

I want to highlight a new logo when we had with Sinclair oil this quarter. They signed up with us for answers because people on the road want to know what's available. What the COVID protocol is for when you get there, and other important information, and we believe we will have opportunities to expand with Sinclair with answers and other UX products in the future. This is an example of how answers led the way; it's a new sales motion that is successfully getting us into use cases that we wouldn't have had a year ago.

18283,Presentation,"Thank you, David. Hey, our third quarter revenue grew 17% year-over-year to $89.1 million and unearned revenue increased 20% year-over-year to $129 million. Annual recurring revenue, our ARR metric at the end of Q3 was $346 million. That's up 18% year-over-year from the 293 we reported a year ago quarter. Our trailing 12 months net dollar based retention, which excludes our SMB customers was 103%, and our trailing 12-month net dollar based retention for direct enterprise, which also excludes our SMB and third-party resellers was 104%, while our gross retention was solid within historical levels, what we saw was muted upsells, particularly in our customers with retail footprint, and in EMEA, where there's another round of lockouts. In the near-term, we continue to see customers be conservative with expansions, given the volatile macro-economic environment, but in the long run, we expect our upsell rate to return to historical levels, as we continue to grow after since the existing customer base and expand with other products and services as well.",Steve Cakebread,4392913
,,,,
18284,Presentation,"One note before turning to margins and expenses I'll just point out that we'll be discussing both GAAP and non-GAAP results, and we provided a reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP in our earnings report. Q3 GAAP gross margin was 75.7% this quarter, and that compares to 73.3% in a year ago quarter. Q3 non-GAAP gross margin was 77.4% compared to 74.9% in the year ago quarter. The change in gross margin was primarily driven by leverage on higher revenue.",Steve Cakebread,4392913
,,,,
18285,Presentation,"Year-to-date non-GAAP gross margin was 76.9%, compared to 75.6% a year ago. Q3 GAAP operating expenses were $89.2 million and that's down 10% from the $98.8 million in the year ago quarter, Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses were $71.4 million or 80% of revenue, compared to $78.9 million or a 103% of revenue in the year ago quarter. If we make significant progress in managing costs this quarter, non-GAAP sales and marketing expense declined 11% year-over-year and non-GAAP G&A expense declined 14% year-over-year, compared to a year ago quarter the primary drivers of this decrease were onward user conference, which is typically hosted in the fall, but didn't happen this year. We've reduced spend on travel and events and significantly improved overall operational efficiencies. Year-to-date, non-GAAP operating expenses were $223 million or 85% of revenue, and that compares to $206 million or 95% of revenue a year ago. We continue as David said, to drive lower sales and marketing in general G&A spend as a percent of sales.",Steve Cakebread,4392913

18287,Presentation,"Many of these efforts are sustainable changes and will drive our operating margins higher over time. Given uncertain business conditions, we're remaining conservative with our hiring, but we're keeping our goal with 255 quota carrying sales reps by the end of the fiscal year, and we're continuing to invest in product innovation and revenue generating opportunities. At the end of Q3, we had nearly 240 quota carrying sales people on board. Q3 GAAP net loss was $22 million compared to $42.7 million loss a year ago quarter. That's a 48% improvement over last year. On the basis of $120.7 million, weighted average basic shares outstanding, net loss per share of $0.18 this quarter compares to $0.38 loss a year ago, on the basis of $113.5 million weighted average basic shares outstanding. Q3 non-GAAP net loss, that's excluding stock-based comp was $2.8 million. That's a dramatic improvement compared to the $21.6 million loss in the year ago quarter, and our non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.02 compares to $0.19 loss in the year ago quarter.",Steve Cakebread,4392913

CapEx was $13.9 million compared to $2.9 million in the year ago quarter, and we continue to make progress with our building projects in New York, Washington D.C., Tokyo, and Paris, and we expect remaining CapEx related to these projects to be about $19 million, and based on current schedules we expect most of this to occur in Q4.",Steve Cakebread,4392913

We expect a weighted average basic share account of approximately $123.3 million shares into for Q4. Q4 EPS is impacted by $0.02 to $0.03 of one-time non-recurring expenses. We continue to drive Answers into a broad market opportunity, and as Howard described, we have the opportunity to help our customers drive value and deliver answers, not ads. Q4 is typically where we get a large amount of our business. We have a significant pipeline of opportunities that we're executing against, however our guidance is being realistic, that global business conditions remain difficult due to the pandemic, including recent shutdowns, both in Europe and the United States.",Steve Cakebread,4392913

,,,,
18296,Question-and-Answer,"Great, thank you. Steve, if can maybe just start off with you on the guidance for Q4. We typically see that being a seasonally strong quarter for you, where I think the guidance implies a pretty meaningful slowdown in growth and a step down in revenue. Can you just maybe dig into those dynamics a little bit more, and the assumptions that you have baked in there? And is there an uptick in turn or new logos slowing down in Q4, so maybe help us understand those dynamics a little bit?",Arjun Bhatia,4392913
,,,,
18297,Question-and-Answer,,Arjun Bhatia,4392913
,,,,
18298,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, that's a great question. I mean, as I said in the scripted comments, we're trying to be realistic here. We're looking at lockdowns coming and going, and we think this quarter is probably going to be more challenging than that we saw in Q1 and part of Q2. So we're just being realistic. Like I said on the call, our gross retention is doing quite well, but we need upsells as well from our customers, and I think just given uncertainty around the world that we're seeing, we're going to sit and say, look, we're going to deliver these results. We're still focused on improving operational activities as well, but I think on the revenue side, we just really -- Q4 is a big quarter. It doesn't necessarily add to revenue in the quarter, it'll set us up for next year, but I just think the uncertainty in the global macroeconomics right now, we're just going to be realistic about what we can do, and deliver those results.",Steve Cakebread,4392913
,,,,
18299,Question-and-Answer,"Got it, thank you, and Howard, I saw an announcement that you guys made that you had a new WordPress integration with Answers. There's obviously a pretty big WordPress footprint out there. Can you just help us understand that opportunity, what it means for Answers adoption? And should we think of that as being similar to the Adobe partnership that you have or is there a different dynamic at play there?",Arjun Bhatia,4392913
,,,,
18300,Question-and-Answer,"The WordPress differs -- thanks for the question. The WordPress integration addresses a little bit of a different segment. The bigger enterprises tend to use an Adobe -- the Adobe Experience Cloud. The WordPress integration really is targeting more of some of our CBU customers. The biggest bottleneck for us is often getting the Answers integration live on a Web site, and so, the WordPress integration makes it so that anybody using WordPress can do it without code. They can just easily plug it in, turn it on. So that has been a nice little way to get faster with a bunch of sort of mid-sized customers that want to use Answers.",Howard Lerman,4392913

18301,Question-and-Answer,"Perfect, thank you.",Arjun Bhatia,4392913

,,,,
18303,Question-and-Answer,"Hi, this is [indiscernible]. I was wondering if you could give us some more context on some of the success you've had with Answers versus other areas of the business, and kind of when we can start to think about uptick in there offsetting some of the uncertainty that you're seeing in this and just kind of the timing of when we can see that kind of move the needle? Thank you.",Unidentified Analyst,4392913
,,,,
18304,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, thanks for the question. First off, in Q3 we closed 86 Answers deals, and I just want to be clear, that's not free trials, that's closed business in the quarter, and that represented 30% of our new ACV, new in upsell globally, and by the way, that compares to 20% is what we saw in Q2. So we are seeing tremendous momentum in Answers. In addition to that, Land with Answers, it is clear, is a more efficient sales motion. I think we've been talking about this for the past couple quarters, of landing light with Answers, and it's not a new strategy, it's a new sales motion to land with the product that addresses 100% of the world that every client needs, every business needs in their Web site. We can get out there, we can land with this product, and we can upsell it.",Howard Lerman,4392913
,,,,
18305,Question-and-Answer,"And so you've seen us be able to penetrate new markets like government, new markets like higher education, go check it out on Bucknell.edu or TCU.edu, you can -- or even the World Health Organization, if you go to WHO.int, that's their Web site, and click to their COVID-19 site you'll see we're answering tons and tons of questions there. This is a really big opportunity. We're completely focused on both revenue growth through acceleration of Answers, but also at the same time we're focused on operational efficiency, and that's what you saw in Q3, like we pointed out on the script to basically suggest we went from minus, I think -- we were minus $0.02 on our EPS, showing the -- and the decrease from 81% of revenue in sales and marketing to 64% year-over-year. So we are seeing huge efficiencies in addition to our ability to acquire logos with 86 closed in the quarter.",Howard Lerman,4392913

18307,Question-and-Answer,Got it. Thank you very much. That's it. Thanks.,Unidentified Analyst,4392913
,,,,
18308,Question-and-Answer,And our next question will come from Naved Khan with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.,Operator,4392913
,,,,
18309,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, thanks a lot. Two questions, so on the last call, on the second quarter call, I think you guys had talked about sort of a bottleneck or almost too much demand for Answers, where it just takes a lot of time to onboard customers, any progress in removing that? And I think you also spoke about self-serve as potentially a solution. Can you maybe touch on that a little bit? And then secondarily, can you also talk about the Adobe partnership and any early results from that channel that you might have to date?",Naved Khan,4392913
,,,,
18310,Question-and-Answer,"Naved, this is Howard. I'll take the first part of your question, and I'll kick it over to Dave for the Adobe update. We're very focused on removing friction to be able to be a self-serve product. The two main things that we did in the Q that made that accelerate were, first, we went general availability with our Hitchhiker program, and Hitchhiker program, that's our brand for Yext admin, those are the super experts in our platform, and historically, it's been pretty hard. You had to be an expert to set up and use Yext. You really had to know your way around. You didn't have to be an engineer, but you had to be -- have a lot of institutional knowledge to be able to configure things.",Howard Lerman,4392913
,,,,
18311,Question-and-Answer,"And we've been working really hard to simplify that and to put better training in place, and we've seen a great pickup in people becoming Hitchhikers, and now, if you go to our site, it's funny, because you can almost track what's happening in the flows and stuff because if you just go to our Web site and you click Free Trial you go through that. There is a self-serve experience there, and there's quite a lot of people coming through that every day, and then what happens is we still have to get people set up manually, helping them get their Knowledge Graph set up, except if you really know and you become a Hitchhiker you can start to do this yourself. So we've seen some pickup there.",Howard Lerman,4392913
,,,,
18312,Question-and-Answer,"And then once you have the data in, what we need you to do is put it up on your site, and that's where things like the WordPress integration, and that's the second big thing we did this quarter, to remove the friction from that flow to become more self-serve. With a few clicks you can set up Answers on your WordPress site if you are a WordPress user and have set up your data in your Knowledge Graph. We continue to make progress there. We continue to see quite a lot of free trial requests every day. You can almost go through and monitor the flow; you'll see every time you log in and try to do something you're going to see an update there. This is a process; it's not going to happen overnight to become a self-served landing, but that is the sort of north star here, and we're excited about the progress we've made.",Howard Lerman,4392913
,,,,
18313,Question-and-Answer,"And Naved, it's David Rudnitsky, and just to answer your question about Adobe, we've got a really good motion going with them now, and I feel really good about it. I've had success building a partner program in the past, and we've got a solid bottom up top down engagement, we started to get our Field A's engaged on account base together pursuits, we've started to engage at the highest levels with our executives, I feel like the collaboration is going really well, and we've had a few deals that were completely influenced by our relationship with Adobe this past quarter, and as I look at the excitement of going into the Q4, we've got a number of engagements where we're partnering with them together on joint pursuits in a very bespoke way, and we found a couple great use cases to work together. So I feel really good about it.",David Rudnitsky,4392913

,,,,
18315,Question-and-Answer,"Thank you, maybe a quick clarification, if I may, on the first part of the answer. So if I had to just think about the backlog, whether it's Answers or the core offering, how does that look like compared to the prior quarter?",Naved Khan,4392913
,,,,
18316,Question-and-Answer,"We continue to drive great demand for Answers. It's clear every company needs it, it's clear that a free trial is a compelling offer, particularly for mid-market companies, and the hope is that with integrations with companies like WordPress that are large CMS companies in power, tons of small business and mid-sized business Web sites will accelerate that. For the big companies, they come through and that still requires a real Yext Admin to be with you, and that's more on the company that's using Experienced Cloud, or a company that's using a bigger CMS that wants to use our platform, and so, they'll end up in Dave's hands.",Howard Lerman,4392913

,,,,
18320,Question-and-Answer,"Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. One for David, was there any uncertainty near the end of the quarter as we were leading up to U.S. Election? And then Steve, can you talk about the mix of sustainable or durable OpEx improvements versus one-time savings from Yext ONWARD Conference and less travel this year?",Matt Coss,4392913
,,,,
18321,Question-and-Answer,"Hey, Matt, as far as the Election, surprisingly, no, I mean, it was a point of interest when you engage with the customer to talk about it, it was on top of mind, but it didn't influence any of our deal cycles whatsoever that I know of. It's a non-issue actually.",David Rudnitsky,4392913
,,,,
18322,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, I'd like to just add to that. I mean, we had a really solid Q3, especially in the United States, especially United States.",Steve Cakebread,4392913
,,,,
18323,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, and then with regards to sustainable yes, obviously, a third of the spend was around ONWARD, we're rethinking that a little bit. We'll see what happens next year, depending on how the world opens up. The other there yes, obviously, the travel is at close to zero, not zero, but we're also making huge progress in infrastructure.",David Rudnitsky,4392913
,,,,
18324,Question-and-Answer,"As Howard said, the sales motions with Answers has changed dramatically, and we think a majority of that savings is going to be sustainable. We're still working on processes and infrastructure, self service is going to help. So I feel fairly comfortable, we're on a good trajectory to continue to improve our OpEx as a percent of revenues and drive those down, and we'll see how things go next year as well, but we're really got our teams looking at changing processes, the sales motion is changing with both self-serve and Answers and feel good that will be on a sustainable path to our non-GAAP breakevens at some point.",David Rudnitsky,4392913
,,,,
18325,Question-and-Answer,"Okay, that's helpful. Thank you, and then maybe one last one, so I know you're being prudent with the Q4 guide, and especially mid-COVID resurgence and the lockdown. It's hard to predict the future, but I mean, do you think Q4 might be low watermark in terms of growth, or any additional, we don't know, we don't know.",Matt Coss,4392913
,,,,
18326,Question-and-Answer,"That's a great question, and to be fair, Howard, and I have that conversation almost daily as to where's the bottom in all of this? I will say that, we're being realistic in our growth, and it's not because we think, we know we're not losing customers, but we also know that they're not stepping in yet. The renewals, like I said on a gross basis were historically good, and we feel good about that. So, as people start, not just us, but as other companies start to see daylight at the end of this tunnel with a goal of 255 sales reps with good gross retention, with new products, we feel that we're going to be in great position to start to benefit from that up tick, your question is a million dollar question, though, is when does that start, and I just think with the uncertainties coming into Q4 for everybody, it's hard to call that bottom at the moment but we'll see as the next couple of months progress what happens here.",David Rudnitsky,4392913

,,,,
18335,Question-and-Answer,"Okay, two questions, please. I'm trying to figure out the materiality of answers to Yext business that 30% of new TCV is useful, of total TCV now, does that mean it's probably high single-digits, low double-digits, and then you just talked about other products and solutions, and you mentioned it earlier in the script, could you spend a little bit of time on what those are? Thanks a lot.",Mark Mahaney,4392913
,,,,
18336,Question-and-Answer,"Hey, Mark. Most of our deals that we're starting to beat that, we started to see are really being Answers led which means that Answers are huge part of our deal and huge part of the deal and often is the deal. If you look at higher Ed, for example, that's a 100% Answers led deal and 100% Answers deal at Bucknell University, Texas Christian University, if you look at the States that we sold into and government, those are primarily Answers deals, almost entirely Answers deals.",Howard Lerman,4392913
,,,,
18337,Question-and-Answer,"That's the main use case that that's being solved for there. So it's material, and if you look at the biggest deal that Dave talked about close with the top three financial institution, that was the biggest deal in the quarter, I think we said how big it was, it was about $2 million of ACV. That was an Answers deal, and that was the main use case there. Their Head of Digital came in sat down with Dave and I right before the pandemic started, and he said, ""Oh, gosh, what I'd love is a Google for my own Web site,"" and boy, we were like, ""Do we have something for you?""",Howard Lerman,4392913
,,,,
18338,Question-and-Answer,"And that is where, Answers materialize from that deal. So Answers is material part of our business, and going forward, Mark, the best way, I think to think about us as we've retuned our company a little bit this year we're search company, and, if you look at the biggest companies out there, every customer journey starts with the search when you think about our new products where we might go, there are extraordinary applications for search across every company, and that doesn't mean just on a Web site, that could mean search internally, that could mean search for a product, that could mean search for content. That means all sorts of technologies around search, and we think that with landing with the Answers, we're setting ourselves up to be able to be a search partner, for every company for every company that needs it, starting with their own customer journey, but expanding into all the areas across their enterprise where they need search all by the way, I should mention founded on that original principle that if you read S1, the very first sentence says, ""Yext is a knowledge engine."" It's all about the knowledge graph. The breakthrough Yext is knowledge-based search, no other search company out there does knowledge-based, search-based on NLP, it's all index-based, it's all keyword-based. Our unique angle, our differentiator is knowledge-based, search-based on a knowledge graph. We're going to do that for every company that we can, in every area that we can, in all kinds of new markets as we build what we think, what I think could be the second biggest search company on the planet.",Howard Lerman,4392913

18341,Question-and-Answer,,Chad Schoening,4392913
,,,,
18342,Question-and-Answer,"Hi, guys, this is Chad Schoening on for Koji. Thanks for taking the questions. Two questions here, if I may. First on free trials, I know you haven't given an exact number on the conversion rate there in the past, but can you share any incremental details there on how that's kind of trended throughout the quarter, and what your expectations are there kind of into the New Year? And then I have one follow-up. Thanks.",Chad Schoening,4392913
,,,,
18343,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, free trial is one way. We're getting customers to come in. It's a marketing offer. It's a limited time offer. We started in March. We may keep it, we may not, it's going pretty great. It's been very successful in generating interest, it has been very successful in generating leads for our sellers, it's not the only way we land, you know, for example, I think we mentioned that top three bank, that top three financial institution, we often land without a free trial and that's okay too. The free trial is more compelling for mid-market or CBU customers or prospects than it is for enterprise. We look closely at the conversion rates. It typically it's classic SaaS. If you look at the classic softwares and services company, you'll see conversion rates between 20 and 50%, depending on the industry and the segment, and we're right in line with that.",Howard Lerman,4392913
,,,,
18344,Question-and-Answer,"Great. That's super helpful, and then my second one is actually on the technology side, and thanks again for that demo at the onset of the call there that was helpful. I'm just thinking about the kind of increasing prevalence of chatbots and AI, and curious how you're leveraging the increased philosophy of search data from all the customer queries on your platform to kind of improve that value proposition to your customers, and is that all finding its way into kind of your R&D roadmap? Thanks.",Chad Schoening,4392913
,,,,
18345,Question-and-Answer,"It's funny. It's a really great question, Chad, because as we all know with AI and machine learning, data is oil. Data is gold. The more data you have, the more questions you have, the better your models get, the more tests you can run, the better answers you can give. So the more queries we handle and we are beginning to handle lots and lots and lots of queries every day, and like I told you, it's our objective to be the second biggest search company on the planet, the better and better our search results get, which is happening continuously. We just put out a search release in the quarter. I think we actually put this out into general availability this week, or last week we met had a multi-algorithm improvement where users can of our system hitchhikers can pick which types of algorithms they want to apply to which types of entities, which is super cool. That means, hey, if you're using maps, I might want to use a direct answer. If someone asks for a phone number, but I might want to use extractive Q&A, which is a different algorithm for someone that's asked a question, which is contained in an FAQ, these are all the parts that make up a modern search engine.",Howard Lerman,4392913
,,,,
18346,Question-and-Answer,"And so, to your point, the more data you have, the better answers you're going to give, and then you also asked about chatbots and chatbots. Let's be clear when we talk about chatbots, there really are a lot of different kinds of chatbots out there. Most of them aren't really chatbots at all, but are just chat windows that try to get you to put your phone number in which become a lead gen form, and then someone is texting you that you didn't want to talk to and they have your phone number. So that's what most chat quote chatbots look like, and that's not really a chatbot. That's really just a form to get you to get your phone number. We think, and by the way, chatbots or chat or live chat, it turns out it's actually kind of expensive. It costs money everytime someone chats with you on the other end, if there is someone, even if they're in an outsource center in the Philippines or India or wherever they're chatting with you, that's still costs dollars per session, sort of like a customer support call. So we think that search has a place where it will always be, which is to deflect as many chats or as many customer success or service calls as possible, you know, Krispy Kreme for example in that example we gave earlier, they've seen a reduction in call volume to their call center of 42% since putting answers up, that's an astounding savings, and so, simply by being able to ask a question and search on a site and get a quick answer that will deflect a lot of people that would have otherwise tried to chat, tried to call thereby saving the company money. So chatting is really getting pretty deep into your personal account situation, and that's pretty different than, ""Hey, what's the routing number for a bank? Or, ""Hey, you know, how do I check my Krispy Kreme reward card balance? Or, ""Hey, what's the phone number of Dr. Rudnitsky?""",Howard Lerman,4392913

18347,Question-and-Answer,,Howard Lerman,4392913
,,,,
18348,Question-and-Answer,"Great, thank you.",Chad Schoening,4392913
,,,,
18349,Question-and-Answer,And our next question will come from Ryan McDonald with Needham. Please go ahead.,Operator,4392913
,,,,
18350,Question-and-Answer,"Hi, thanks for taking my questions, Howard, I guess expanding upon sort of your previous answer. You've talked a lot about with answers that the really the value propositions are one driving increased conversions and driving more sales by e-commerce on people's Web sites, but then also customer service deflection. I'm just curious as you're going out there and sort of trying to demonstrate the ROI of answers, which use case seems to be resonating more and has that shifted at all, uh, given sort of the strong trends we've seen early in the holiday season in terms of e-commerce trends as well as sort of customer service interactions over digital channels.",Ryan McDonald,4392913
,,,,
18351,Question-and-Answer,"Well, first off Ryan, I'd love to -- you did a great job with the picture with those first few value props, we are hiring quota carrying reps still in North America, and we look forward to your application. If you go to the Yext Web site and search for jobs, you should search for that in Yext Answers, you will see a list of jobs because of our NLP. So, great job with the first 2 value props, but there was a third too, which you also sort of hit on, which is the ROI. So the three value props of Yext answers when we sell, we run in our selling program, in our magic pitch are number one, that every customer journey starts with the question, and there're two places where that can happen on Google, your own site, and when you have, when someone's on Google, they're going to see ads and when they're on your own site, you keep control and they're going to get answers from you directly. I think by the way we also showed from our blog post and we talked about this on the script that branded search and searches on Google are intricately linked overnight after putting up our own Yext answers box in our own site, brand searches for Yext went down 34%, and they correspondingly went up on our own site, we saw roughly the equivalent searches happen that we were able to handle.",Howard Lerman,4392913
,,,,
18352,Question-and-Answer,"So it really depends on the industry, what the particular value prop is to the business, and so, in the case of a retailer, it might be call deflection, but in the case of a healthcare company. Boy, it might be all about offering virtual appointments, we've seen certain cases of companies that begin to offer the ability to book a COVID-19 test within their search experience on their site, and you see a rocket in search volume across and we're talking big numbers here, people searching on their Web site for COVID-19 tests and booking a virtual, sorry booking a real appointment to show up at a physical time at a later date. So it really just depends on the industry, but the third value prop is the intelligence, is the fact that you can see what people are asking, and you get real time insights into those questions and can exactly see how many phone calls you got, how many driving directions you got off that modern dynamic search interface, which looks a heck of a lot like Google except it's on your own site where you have your own customers and keep all those conversions for yourself as opposed to send them to your competitor.",Howard Lerman,4392913
,,,,
18353,Question-and-Answer,"So, I look forward to your -- [multiple speakers]?",Howard Lerman,4392913
,,,,
18354,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, yes, super helpful, and yes, we'll look for that online I suppose. I guess, my second question is I've seen that the recent expansion to the Japanese language, and it looks like maybe you're starting to have some early success there, can you talk about sort of the resources you're now looking to allocate to that Asia-Pac region as a growth opportunity, maybe I'll start selling there for you?",Ryan McDonald,4392913
,,,,
18355,Question-and-Answer,"Patrick, you want to take that question?",Howard Lerman,4392913
,,,,
18356,Question-and-Answer,,Patrick Blair,4392913
,,,,
18357,Question-and-Answer,"Yes, I could take that question. Thank you very much for the question. We got a great launch of answers in Japan, as it sounds like you've probably seen we have our sales team there trained up where we're trying to collaborate globally across sales to make sure that the magic pitch. Howard just mentioned, is obviously translated the right way into Japanese, and that team is all out there trained and ready to go. So that team is ready to go and rock in terms of allocation of resources. We have a marketing team in Japan. We have a sales organization in Japan. We have hitchhikers in Japan, so we're ready to go with answers there.",Patrick Blair,4392913
,,,,
18358,Question-and-Answer,"Excellent, thanks.",Ryan McDonald,4392913
,,,,
18359,Question-and-Answer,And our next question will come from Tom White with DA Davidson. Please go ahead.,Operator,4392913
,,,,
18360,Question-and-Answer,"Great, thanks for taking my question. Howard, in the beginning of the prepared remarks you talked at length about Google and your answers not ad -- not ads kind of messaging, any early date or kind of thoughts on how that message that kind of go-to-market messages resonating with your customers and I guess Google's obviously an important partner for you guys for the location's product, and presumably for your customers as well, so maybe just comment on, I guess how you how you guys kind of envision yourself kind of bouncing those dynamics. I mean, is that an issue or is that not something that I should be thinking about? Thanks.",Tom White,4392913
,,,,
18361,Question-and-Answer,"Thanks for the question. It's not an issue to marketing campaign for our search product, very different than a data partnership with a math team. Look, we are working really hard to get the word out there about Yext as a search company. I told this to, just a second ago to Mark when we were talking, that when you look at the biggest companies, every customer journey, every customer experience starts with a question, starts with the search, and we've been for the last decade building up enough structured knowledge and enough technology in the NLP side to become a fully formed search company, and what you were seeing is site search as the first sort of portion of that on top of the Knowledge Graph. This isn't a change in strategy. This is a change to what you've seen this year as a change in sales motion with our land with Answers motion and which by the way, is clearly more efficient because you've seen quantitatively the improvements in sales and marketing over revenue quarter-over-quarter, it's 64% of time versus 81% at last time, and so, everything we've been doing is all about repositioning and positioning this company as a search company, becoming a fully formed search company of which site search and Answers is the first part.",Howard Lerman,4392913
,,,,
18362,Question-and-Answer,"Got it, thank you.",Tom White,4392913
,,,,
18363,Question-and-Answer,We have our final question comes from Rohit Kulkarni with MKM Partners. Please go ahead.,Operator,4392913
,,,,
18364,Question-and-Answer,"Hey, thank you. Thank you for squeezing me in. Hope everybody hear me fine. I guess question on November. Are you seeing budgets allocated to Yext Answers coming from different pockets in their company as it feels to me that they're historically probably came from more IT, more people managing the Web site and like that? Are you seeing kind of deeper pockets like if 34% of branded search results came back to Yext, then probably that's a very big potential ROI for a large company spending a lot of money on Google. So any anecdotes that you can share on whether you're seeing kind of budgets to Yext coming from other places within a large organization?",Rohit Kulkarni,4392913
,,,,
18365,Question-and-Answer,"Hey, Rohit; Dave Rudnitsky, yes, what's interesting is we're seeing budgets come from a multiple sets of executives, it could be from the Chief Digital Officer, it could be from the Chief Marketing Officer, it could be from the CIO, it could be from the Chief Experience Officer, what we're hearing from all of our customers and the reason I feel so good about what we did this past quarter, is we're in the middle of their probably their most important initiative right now, which is digital transformation.",David Rudnitsky,4392913
,,,,
18366,Question-and-Answer,,David Rudnitsky,4392913
,,,,
18367,Question-and-Answer,"We just concluded our client advisory board late yesterday afternoon, and we had 20 of the biggest brands, not just the Yext but 20 of the biggest important name brands in the world, and they laid out for us their top initiatives, and interestingly enough, the four of them were all focused around digital transformation, it was the acceleration of it, they know they need to change quickly, just like sales companies have changed their sales motion, they need to change the way they do business.",David Rudnitsky,4392913
,,,,
18368,Question-and-Answer,"So it's acceleration of the digital transformation. It's the ability to make it pervasive. So not just go after a silo, will go after the entire Corporation and change the way they do business. They have to have a strategy of balancing both potential go back to work, physical with digital, and the other thing they really want and Howard alluded to this before, they want actionable insights, they want to understand what's going on with the business and how to react, and our platform puts us right in the middle of and that's why we're starting to see all of these different lines of business or lines of executives come in and actually put money on the table, and it's exciting, because whether it's coming from the CTO, or the CIO, the CTO, the CXO, we've been interacting with all of them, most of our sales cycles, and it's exciting to see. So we're not too siloed from where the budgets are coming from.",David Rudnitsky,4392913
,,,,
18369,Question-and-Answer,"Okay, great, and if I could ask one follow-up, different topic on proportion of kind of spend or budgets coming from restaurants and retail, how is that trending and do you think the renewals as well as new wins in that in those two categories have kind of bottomed out?",Rohit Kulkarni,4392913
,,,,
18370,Question-and-Answer,"Well, we talked, I think at our earnings call for Q1 about a Tale of Two Cities, where there are certain types of industries which are clearly very affected by COVID-19, and there's no question that a number of those industries that you transact, for example off of Google Maps with to go there physically, whether it's a hotel, whether it's a restaurant, whether it's an airline, wherever you're interacting in the real world, even healthcare. Those industries have been really hurt by the pandemic. They've been slowed. Our gross retention levels have been solid. They've been at historical or around historical levels in the past couple of quarters. Like Steve said, what they haven't done has been willing to expand. So what we've seen is, they've kind of helped their holding, they've been slower to drive expansion particularly in Europe and that's where you've seen the net retention number come down a little bit, but the gross retention number that we look at has been solid.",David Rudnitsky,4392913

All three of our high growth, higher margin businesses; BOSS Revolution Money Transfer, NRS and net2phone's cloud communications offerings generated impressive year-over-year revenue growth. In aggregate, these businesses have been contributing an increasing share of our consolidated revenue less direct cost of revenue, and this quarter their contribution topped 30%.

By the end of the quarter, we were billing for over 12,000 deployed terminals. net2phone?s cloud communications business, now reported as the net2phone-UCaaS segment increased revenue by one-third compared to the year ago quarter to $9.6 million. I was particularly happy to see strong sequential growth in our Latin American markets. Many of these markets slowed early in the year as a result of COVID-19. LATAM subscription revenue increased 30% sequentially and our business there should benefit from expansion to new markets going forward.",Shmuel Jonas,4392903
